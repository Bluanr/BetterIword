PRIDE AND PREJUDICE
By Jane Austen
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters.
“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?”
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it.”
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.
“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”
This was invitation enough.
“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he
is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to
be in the house by the end of next week.”
“What is his name?”
“Bingley.”
“Is he married or single?”
“Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”
“How so? How can it affect them?”
“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”
“Is that his design in settling here?”
“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes.”
“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the
party.”
“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”
“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”
“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood.”
“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”
“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to
go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no
newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to
visit him if you do not.”
“You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”
“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”
“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters.”
“Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You
take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”
“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
these last twenty years at least.”
“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”
“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”
“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
visit them.”
“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all.”
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind
was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,
she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.
Chapter 2
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring
his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with:
“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”
“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother
resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”
“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”
“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces
of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her.”
“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you.”
Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
“Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”
“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times
them ill.”
“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is
your next ball to be, Lizzy?”
“To-morrow fortnight.”
“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back
till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself.”
“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr. Bingley to _her_.”
“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teasing?”
“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,
Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself.”
The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,
nonsense!”
“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,
Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
great books and make extracts.”
Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.
“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.
Bingley.”
“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.
“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If
I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called
on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now.”
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.
“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a
word about it till now.”
“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was
shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so
pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball.”
“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I'm the tallest.”
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.
Chapter 3
Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.
“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”
 said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”
In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about
ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had
heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already
had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable
to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears
a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get
a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only
six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.
Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes
after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he
was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all
his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving
one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man
in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted one of her daughters.
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend
to join it.
“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
dance.”
“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this
it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with.”
“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in
my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty.”
“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.
“Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”
“Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:
“She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”
Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,
however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as
her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With
a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on
the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a
different story to hear.
“Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well
she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her
twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,
and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,
and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--”
“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,
“he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of
his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!”
“Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
Hurst's gown--”
Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.
“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”
Chapter 4
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very
much she admired him.
“He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,
good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much
ease, with such perfect good breeding!”
“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”
“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I
did not expect such a compliment.”
“Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between
us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
stupider person.”
“Dear Lizzy!”
“Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your
life.”
“I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak
what I think.”
“I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it
everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the
good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing
of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,
too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”
“Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her.”
Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,
and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she
was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine
ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the
power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and
conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the
first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand
pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of
associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect
entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of
a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply
impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their
own had been acquired by trade.
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an
estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.
His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,
though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation
to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for
half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
immediately.
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley
had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.
In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means
deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not
inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
giving offense.
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive
to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt
acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not
conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
but she smiled too much.
Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one
whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.
Chapter 5
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a
disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;
and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house
about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,
where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,
unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all
the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him
supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By
nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.
James's had made him courteous.
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest
of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
Elizabeth's intimate friend.
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over
a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.
“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with civil
self-command to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice.”
“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”
“Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr. Robinson.”
“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not
I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many
pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,
beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'”
“Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as
if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”
“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said
Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.”
“I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.”
“Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.
“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”
“Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at
being spoke to.”
“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much,
unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable.”
“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it
was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had
heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise.”
“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I
wish he had danced with Eliza.”
“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,
if I were you.”
“I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”
“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud.”
“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”
“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may
be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”
“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with
his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.”
“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.
Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle
directly.”
The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.
Chapter 6
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on
the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards
the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment
of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It
was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and
to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions
of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.
“It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”
“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to
discover it too.”
“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.”
“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out.”
“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should
therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his
attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for
falling in love as much as she chooses.”
“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,
she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character.”
“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal.”
“Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they
both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”
“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and
if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life.”
“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”
Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly
had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were
assembled.
“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?”
“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”
“But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”
On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said:
“Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly
well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?”
“With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady
energetic.”
“You are severe on us.”
“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”
“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
she added, “Very well, if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing
at Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of
course familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and I
shall keep mine to swell my song.”
Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that
she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,
with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
dancing at one end of the room.
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was
his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:
“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There
is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished society.”
“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.”
Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”
“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”
“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
you often dance at St. James's?”
“Never, sir.”
“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”
“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”
“You have a house in town, I conclude?”
Mr. Darcy bowed.
“I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond
of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas.”
He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed
to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her:
“My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.”
 And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:
“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”
Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny
me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
for one half-hour.”
“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.
“He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,
we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a
partner?”
Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:
“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”
“I should imagine not.”
“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the
nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would
I give to hear your strictures on them!”
“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:
“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”
“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you
joy?”
“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”
“Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is
absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;
and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.”
He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.
Chapter 7
Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.
She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to
their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade.
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
headquarters.
Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most
interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge
of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a
secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.
Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of
felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and
Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation
to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
regimentals of an ensign.
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed:
“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced.”
Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,
and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London.
“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however.”
“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”
“Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”
“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish.”
“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when
I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my
heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought
Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in
his regimentals.”
“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library.”
Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with
a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,
“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”
“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.
“MY DEAR FRIEND,--
“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,
we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,
for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a
quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the
gentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,
“CAROLINE BINGLEY”
“With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_.”
“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”
“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.
“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night.”
“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home.”
“Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton,
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”
“I had much rather go in the coach.”
“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?”
“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”
“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother's purpose
will be answered.”
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a
bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before
it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back.
“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the
next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:
“MY DEAREST LIZZY,--
“I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not
hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.
Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been
to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the
matter with me.--Yours, etc.”
“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”
“Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling
colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is
all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.”
Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking
was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.
“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
there.”
“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”
“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the
horses?”
“No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing
when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”
“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”
“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.
Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
together.
“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”
In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.
She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such
dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there
was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.
Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as
to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
thinking only of his breakfast.
Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not
well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them
together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
her.
When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught
a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in
fact, nothing to do elsewhere.
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to
Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply
of clothes.
Chapter 8
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain
dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the
same, and added:
“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
looked almost wild.”
“She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”
“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office.”
“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was
all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice.”
“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such
an exhibition.”
“Certainly not.”
“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by
it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country-town indifference to decorum.”
“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said
Bingley.
“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, “that
this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.”
“Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:
“I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very
sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with
such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is
no chance of it.”
“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton.”
“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”
“That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.
“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it
would not make them one jot less agreeable.”
“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend's vulgar relations.
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and
when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.
“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”
“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great
reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”
“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”
“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and
I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.”
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the
table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
others--all that his library afforded.
“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever looked into.”
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.
“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left
so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”
“It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many
generations.”
“And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books.”
“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these.”
“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley.”
“I wish it may.”
“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire.”
“With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.”
“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”
“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”
Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very
little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew
near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his
eldest sister, to observe the game.
“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will
she be as tall as I am?”
“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
rather taller.”
“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished
for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”
“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are.”
“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”
“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and
net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure
I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished.”
“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has
too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished.”
“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.
“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman.”
“Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”
“Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides
all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half-deserved.”
“All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must
yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading.”
“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”
“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this?”
“I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe united.”
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.
“Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,
“is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”
“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
“there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable.”
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief
to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.
Chapter 9
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.
“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be
moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness.”
“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal.”
“You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
“that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she
remains with us.”
Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers
a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are
nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a
charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the
country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it
in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.”
“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”
“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.
“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.
“Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.”
“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through I am afraid is pitiful.”
“That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate
character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”
“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”
“I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you were a
studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”
“Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at
least that advantage.”
“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few subjects for
such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society.”
“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever.”
“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning
a country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town.”
Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.
“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for
my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?”
“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it;
and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”
“Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that
gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing
at all.”
“Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,
which you must acknowledge to be true.”
“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting
with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards
Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.
“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So
genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_
is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.”
“Did Charlotte dine with you?”
“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For
my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;
_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,
I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.”
“She seems a very pleasant young woman.”
“Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody
better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own
partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother
Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was
sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he
did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses
on her, and very pretty they were.”
“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”
“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.
“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”
Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very
equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:
“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.”
Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she
added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.
Chapter 10
The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in union with her opinion of each.
“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”
He made no answer.
“You write uncommonly fast.”
“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”
“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”
“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.”
“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”
“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”
“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
pens remarkably well.”
“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”
“How can you contrive to write so even?”
He was silent.
“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley's.”
“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
present I have not room to do them justice.”
“Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”
“They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me
to determine.”
“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
ease, cannot write ill.”
“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her
brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for
words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”
“My style of writing is very different from yours.”
“Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”
“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”
“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”
“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of
humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast.”
“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”
“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”
“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,
I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”
“I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that
you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better
stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and at another word, might stay a month.”
“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much
more than he did himself.”
“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could.”
“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”
“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for
himself.”
“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to
stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,
that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety.”
“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you.”
“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either.”
“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”
“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to
arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?”
“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
when he has nothing to do.”
Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.
“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,
and want to silence this.”
“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”
“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his letter.”
Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity
to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.
Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,
Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed
on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her
because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,
however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something
more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked
him too little to care for his approbation.
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by
a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her:
“Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?”
She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.
“Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare.”
“Indeed I do not dare.”
Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy
had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery
the next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses.”
“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”
“Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed
in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the
judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different
lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, for
what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”
“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied.”
At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.
“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.
“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without
telling us that you were coming out.”
Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,
and immediately said:
“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
avenue.”
But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered:
“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear
to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth. Good-bye.”
She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.
Chapter 11
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her
sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.
Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed
himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also
made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and
attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire
to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from
the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone
else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.
When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and
the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets
and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss
Bennet.
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she
was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant
it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library.”
No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said:
“By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are
not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure.”
“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he
chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled
thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send
round my cards.”
“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
the day.”
“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball.”
Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked
about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but
Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In
the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,
turning to Elizabeth, said:
“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude.”
Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked
up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
interfere. “What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his
meaning?”--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?
“Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
about it.”
Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in
anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his
two motives.
“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be
completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire.”
“Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”
“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We
can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate
as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”
“But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has
not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of
mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will
not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a
subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.”
“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a
laugh.”
“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be.
The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their
actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
life is a joke.”
“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth--“there are such people, but I hope I
am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.
Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,
and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely
what you are without.”
“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study
of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule.”
“Such as vanity and pride.”
“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.”
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;
“and pray what is the result?”
“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it
himself without disguise.”
“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch
for. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others
so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings
are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper
would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost
forever.”
“_That_ is a failing indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I
really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”
“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”
“And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.”
“And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is willfully to misunderstand
them.”
“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr. Hurst?”
Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
opened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry for
it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.
Chapter 12
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them
very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work
on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.
To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope
of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were
at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her
to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of
its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth.
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human
nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of
threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information
for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said
in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it
had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.
Chapter 13
“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”
“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”
“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.”
Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.
Bingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be
got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this
moment.”
“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life.”
This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:
“About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago
I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.”
“Oh! my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it.”
Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They
had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which
Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.
“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet, “and
nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself.”
“No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did
before him?”
“Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear.”
“Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.
“Dear Sir,--
“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but
for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might
seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone
with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--'There, Mrs.
Bennet.'--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having
received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be
distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de
Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has
preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be
my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which
are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I
flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and
that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate
will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the
offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for
it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
amends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to
receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting
on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight
following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine
is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided
that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I
remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and
daughters, your well-wisher and friend,
“WILLIAM COLLINS”
“At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”
 said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again.”
“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if
he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him.”
“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit.”
Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.
“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him
out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he
mean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he
would help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?”
“No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”
“In point of composition,” said Mary, “the letter does not seem
defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed.”
To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters.
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in
need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a
tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this
instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.
Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.
“You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
oddly.”
“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”
“Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed.”
“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,
when we are better acquainted--”
He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its
cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who
assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a
good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He
begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.
Chapter 14
During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for
his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that “he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in
a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.”
“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and
I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”
“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence.”
“I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?”
“She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property.”
“Ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than
many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”
“She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks
the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many
accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”
“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court.”
“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the
British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable
to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that
her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay.”
“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet, “and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?”
“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible.”
Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner
in his pleasure.
By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad
to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,
glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily
assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything
announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and
begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at
him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some
deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the
volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three
pages, she interrupted him with:
“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away
Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me
so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:
“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes
me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”
Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.
Chapter 15
Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part
of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a
good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which
he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.
Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.
His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a
quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to
her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”
Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before was now high in her good graces.
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed
him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were
immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in
a shop window, could recall them.
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was
the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came
to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the
stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,
determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under
pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately
had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had
reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated
permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with
him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a
commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the
young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.
His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of
beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness
of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and
unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together
very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy
and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the
ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and
began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and
Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to
Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated
it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes
on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the
stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they
looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.
Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,
after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just
deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to
imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.
In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's
pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of
Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the
invitation.
Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,
from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was
eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as
their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing
about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the
street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to
Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility
was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She
received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with
as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous
acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,
however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who
introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an
excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon
put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,
however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that
Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a
lieutenant's commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the
last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.
Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the
occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the
officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,
disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses
the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either
or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain
such behaviour than her sister.
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring
Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be
attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so
much attention in the whole course of his life.
Chapter 16
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and
the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house.
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast
parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what
Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper's room.
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and
the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.
The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.
The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel
that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered
interesting by the skill of the speaker.
With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the
officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind
listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly
supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he
had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.
“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation in life--” Mrs. Phillips was very
glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore
at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear
him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be
told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not
even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.
“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, “He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand.”
“Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear
ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more
capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for
I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my
infancy.”
Elizabeth could not but look surprised.
“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”
“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly. “I have
spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable.”
“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being
agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_
to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”
“Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in
the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find
him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”
“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short
interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”
“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man.” Wickham only shook his head.
“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer.”
“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”
“Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense
of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he
is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never
be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by
a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and
everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
memory of his father.”
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that
he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very
intelligible gallantry.
“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,
“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be
a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.
Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now.”
“Indeed!”
“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere.”
“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his
will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?”
“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain
it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was
of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and
I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can
recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort
of men, and that he hates me.”
“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”
“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.
“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? What can
have induced him to behave so cruelly?”
“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had
not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort
of preference which was often given me.”
“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this.”
After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_
remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of
his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition
must be dreadful.”
“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “I can hardly
be just to him.”
Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To
treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable”--but she contented herself
with, “and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,
connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!”
“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of
use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence,
and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.”
“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for
dishonesty I must call it.”
“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has
connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are
none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride.”
“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”
“Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money
freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what
his father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,
to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,
which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and
careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up
as the most attentive and best of brothers.”
“What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?”
He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to
speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very
proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond
of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is
nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her
home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her
education.”
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying:
“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you
know Mr. Bingley?”
“Not at all.”
“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
Darcy is.”
“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not
want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is
a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His
pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something
for fortune and figure.”
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every
point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,
he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least
importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged
that she would not make herself uneasy.
“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a
card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters.”
Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.
“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him
a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”
“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”
“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's
connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday.”
“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”
This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined for another.
“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”
“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have
not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her
nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an
understanding of the first class.”
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper
put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise
of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to
everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could
think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name
as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and
Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.
Chapter 17
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.
Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she
knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The
possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,
and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
otherwise explained.
“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way
or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side.”
“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody.”
“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such
a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is
impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.”
“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than
that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it
be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his
looks.”
“It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to
think.”
“I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.”
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,
if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair
became public.
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had
been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal
invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed
for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their
dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly
asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To
the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet
as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to
the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an
activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if
eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered
by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look
and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended
less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they
each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,
he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball
was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she
had no disinclination for it.
“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough--I
think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those
who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
everybody.”
Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if
he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance.
“I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball
of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,
can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing
myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of
soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,
a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins
instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help
for it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce
delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy
of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose
to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this
time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there
was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton
once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very
shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have
found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.
Chapter 18
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in
vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty
of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose
the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's
pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though
this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who
told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the
day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,
“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.”
This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every
feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition
to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from
him was ecstasy.
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,
without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; Charlotte tried to console her:
“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”
“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find
a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an
evil.”
When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a
simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding
it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again
silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time
with:--“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked
about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size
of the room, or the number of couples.”
He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.
“Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may
observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But
_now_ we may be silent.”
“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”
“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible.”
“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?”
“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.”
“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”
 said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.”
“I must not decide on my own performance.”
He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance.”
The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said, “Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners
as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of
_retaining_ them, is less certain.”
“He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,” replied Elizabeth
with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life.”
Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.
Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on
his dancing and his partner.
“I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very
superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the
first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at
her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then
flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You
will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that
young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said, “Sir William's interruption has made
me forget what we were talking of.”
“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.
We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we
are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”
“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.
“Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings.”
“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”
“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else.”
“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,
with a look of doubt.
“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_.”
“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.
“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”
“I hope not.”
“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first.”
“May I ask to what these questions tend?”
“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”
“And what is your success?”
She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”
“I can readily believe,” answered he gravely, “that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”
“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity.”
“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,
for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards
her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.
They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and
with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:
“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!
Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among
his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late
Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to
give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's
using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has
always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated
Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but
I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he
cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother
thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to
the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself
out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent
thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,
Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really,
considering his descent, one could not expect much better.”
“His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,” said
Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself.”
“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
“Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.”
“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken
if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for
Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way
before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.
“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister's, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon.”
“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of
his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's,
Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has
been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.”
“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”
“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”
“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”
“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only.”
“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly;
“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of
both gentlemen as I did before.”
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.
Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,
and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as
to make a most important discovery.
“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady
Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have
thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to
do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”
“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!”
“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.”
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him
that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction
as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that
it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she
ceased speaking, replied thus:
“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in
your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your
understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide
difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,
and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that
I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with
the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of
behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to
follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to
perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to
profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant
guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by
education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young
lady like yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.
Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose
astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced
his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of
it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the
words “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed
her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him
with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time
to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,
was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.
“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my
reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in
that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon
be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet
seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the
match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but
three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and
then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.
“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”
“For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you
to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing!”
Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and
blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.
At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and
chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and
she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,
but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of
exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's
eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her
progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very
ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks
of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to
favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was
weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at
Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to
Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs
of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,
imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, “That will do
extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other
young ladies have time to exhibit.”
Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.
“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time
to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The
rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,
especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit
him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an
occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the
family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had
been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many
smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his
wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,
and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably
clever, good kind of young man.
To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,
and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the
gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by
Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though
he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.
She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by
a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of
an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,
how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and
addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he
would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without
the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,
and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on
her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next
day for a short time.
Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four
months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.
Chapter 19
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his
declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at
the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On
finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,
soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:
“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?”
Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
Bennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy
will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I
want you up stairs.” And, gathering her work together, she was hastening
away, when Elizabeth called out:
“Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse
me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am
going away myself.”
“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.” And upon
Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to
escape, she added: “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.
Collins.”
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to
conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between
distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as
they were gone, Mr. Collins began.
“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected
mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the
purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as
soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of
my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”
The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could
not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,
and he continued:
“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will
add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought
to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling
patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked
too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I
left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you
must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose
a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice
and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond
anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and
respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not
be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and
I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no
answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to
decline them.”
“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a
third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”
“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a rather
extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation.”
“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins
very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of
seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your
modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.”
“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You
must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment
of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may
be considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she
thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus
addressed her:
“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on
the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character.”
“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you puzzle me
exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
to convince you of its being one.”
“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for
believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is
unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections
with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further
consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo
the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,
I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”
“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect
forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant
female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking
the truth from her heart.”
“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; “and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable.”
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make
no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if
he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.
Chapter 20
Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open
the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.
This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,
and could not help saying so.
“But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very
headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will
_make_ her know it.”
“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if
she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not
to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”
“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as
good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”
She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library, “Oh! Mr. Bennet, you
are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make
Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you
do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.”
Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication.
“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had
finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”
“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”
“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.”
“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him.”
“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”
Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.
“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for
you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made
you an offer of marriage. Is it true?” Elizabeth replied that it was.
“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”
“I have, sir.”
“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”
“Yes, or I will never see her again.”
“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again
if you _do_.”
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,
but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to
_insist_ upon her marrying him.”
“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be.”
Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane
in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined
interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and
sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner
varied, however, her determination never did.
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”
Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added in a melancholy tone,
“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves.”
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.
“Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told
you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,
and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking
to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it
is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that
any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the
irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of
them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with
an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to
the girls, “Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold
your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation
together.”
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected
conversation: “Oh! Mr. Collins!”
“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.
Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his
displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation
to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a
young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;
and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt
of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;
for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect
to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to
your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my
behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all
liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.”
Chapter 21
The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her
mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly
expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,
but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke
to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or ill
health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.
He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
aunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was
well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.
“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near that I had better not meet
Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”
She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to
her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,
hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and
Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw
her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected
herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual
cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety
on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no
sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane
invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,
Jane, taking out the letter, said:
“This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good
deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on
their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You
shall hear what she says.”
She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a
house. The next was in these words: “I do not pretend to regret anything
I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;
but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that
delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may
lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved
correspondence. I depend on you for that.” To these highflown
expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw
nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to
regard it, in the enjoyment of his.
“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
them.”
“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:”
“When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are
already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my
dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of
that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may
abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your
beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the
three of whom we shall deprive you.”
“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this
winter.”
“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.”
“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own
master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.”
“Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,
_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think
Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;
and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of
her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;
her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?”
“What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane as she
finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that
Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is
perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?”
“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”
“Most willingly.”
“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him
to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you.”
Jane shook her head.
“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She
is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.
Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the
case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she
is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion
that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble
in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and
I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”
“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your
representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the
foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving
herself.”
“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”
“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?”
“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
all means to refuse him.”
“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling. “You must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate.”
“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion.”
“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. A thousand things may arise in six months!”
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of everyone.
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt
on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.
They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After
lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.
Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the
conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had
been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two
full courses.
Chapter 22
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the
chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good
humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”
 Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was
very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her
from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very
soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.
His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas
perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.
In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as
they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure
and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,
were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's
dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were
in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible
nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must
be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly
either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was
the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,
and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest
preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at
the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all
the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business
was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship
she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,
and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be
shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved
to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,
when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was
at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to
publish his prosperous love.
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,
said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever
his engagements might allow him to visit them.
“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and
you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible.”
They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said:
“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness.”
“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence.”
“You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”
“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your
regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though
my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now
take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my
cousin Elizabeth.”
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to
understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her
younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was
a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read
and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very
agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.
The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from
possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
she could not help crying out:
“Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!”
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained
her composure, and calmly replied:
“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible
that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of
their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her
all imaginable happiness.
“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte. “You must be surprised,
very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry
you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be
satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never
was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's
character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state.”
Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was
not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible
that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a
most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself
and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it
was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had
chosen.
Chapter 23
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention
it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to
announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but
incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,
protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and
often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:
“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know
that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.
Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be
happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she
herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her
resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.
Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty
and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort
on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that
no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,
as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his
return.
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised
letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to
their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.
Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and
they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued
absence.
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.
Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as
she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so
dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,
an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed
all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.
Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,
and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight
of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see
them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.
“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!”
“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for
better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.”
This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before.
“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
not for the entail, I should not mind it.”
“What should not you mind?”
“I should not mind anything at all.”
“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility.”
“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own
daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!
Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”
“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.
Chapter 24
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country.
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest
of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's
assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness
to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,
been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as
she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,
on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She
could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether
he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying:
“Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But
I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before.”
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.
“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have
no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A
little time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.”
With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to anyone but myself.”
“My dear Jane!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say
to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve.”
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection.
“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want
to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not
be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see
of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or
sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the
other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is
unaccountable!”
“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will
ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference
of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and
Charlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cousin.”
“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a
conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as
I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him
cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though
it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,
change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
danger security for happiness.”
“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied
Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy
together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You
mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than
it does.”
“And men take care that they should.”
“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”
“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,”
 said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business.”
“And do you impute it to either of those?”
“Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.”
“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”
“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”
“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can
only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it.”
“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride.”
“Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;
“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an
affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what
I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in
the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with
less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she
did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the
effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her
no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best
comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he one day,
“your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.
It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to
be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham
be _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”
“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not
all expect Jane's good fortune.”
“True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to think that whatever of
that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make
the most of it.”
Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they
had known anything of the matter.
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be
any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society
of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.
Chapter 25
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,
Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would
be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his
relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair
cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another
letter of thanks.
On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving
her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas
at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived
by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so
well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger
than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.
They had frequently been staying with her in town.
The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.
Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her
girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was
nothing in it.
“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.
Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think
that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had it not
been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just
as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves.”
Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,
in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
conversation.
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. “It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I am
sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such
as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.”
“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth, “but it will not
do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often
happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before.”
“But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as
often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's
love?”
“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be
finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”
“Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she
would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be
of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
anything.”
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence.
“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her.”
“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such
a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he
would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
never stirs without him.”
“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane
correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”
“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's
attractions.
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she
hoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.
The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's
warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,
from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and
she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.
To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very
part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many
acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since
the death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher
intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of
procuring.
Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute
description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of
praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both
him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's
treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's
reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and
was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam
Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.
Chapter 26
Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given
on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:
“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because
you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want
of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you
must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”
“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”
“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”
“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it.”
“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”
“I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with
Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence
of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My
father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people
are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,
I will do my best.”
“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”
“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: “very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine
that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope
you are satisfied.”
Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that
she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she
rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:
“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”
“_That_ you certainly shall.”
“And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?”
“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”
“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford.”
Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.
“My father and Maria are coming to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and I
hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as
welcome as either of them.”
The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on
the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that
it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most
friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there to know the rest.
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been
lost.
“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”
She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached
her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was
not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall
see them soon here.”
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will
prove what she felt.
“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her
better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been
entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister,
though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I
still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was
as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for
wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to
happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not
return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I
receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that
she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not
calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was
in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was
perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,
though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out
as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting
wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the
cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know
this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily
account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to
his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and
amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,
because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.
He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said
herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she
wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I
cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity
in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,
and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the
invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very
soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield
again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better
not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts
from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and
Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.”
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not
even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on
every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.
Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.
Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth
had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.
All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on: “I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that
I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure
and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and
wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to
think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take
his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the
ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.”
Chapter 27
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There
was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her
a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement
of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.
The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of
what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there
was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to
him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,
whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable
and pleasing.
Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her
think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a
good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but
she had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of
the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were
worn out, like his information.
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen
her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and
kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,
to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.
Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.
“But my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”
“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get
a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary.”
“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think.”
“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”
“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's death
made her mistress of this fortune.”
“No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?”
“But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her
so soon after this event.”
“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?”
“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”
“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”
“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”
“Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all.”
“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.
“We have not determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs. Gardiner,
“but, perhaps, to the Lakes.”
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “Oh, my dear,
dear aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You
give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What
are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport
we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other
travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We
_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.
Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our
imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,
will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_
first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of
travellers.”
Chapter 28
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.
At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the
road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,
everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte
appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which
led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw
instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage;
his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they
were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious
formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's
offers of refreshment.
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its
aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,
as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But
though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to
gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at
her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.
When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her
eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but
in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to
admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to
the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance
with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and
owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way
through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the
fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which
the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the
prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered
the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome
modern building, well situated on rising ground.
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;
but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's
help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which
Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be
forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
in, observed:
“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice
when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she
will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed
to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I
_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.”
“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,” added
Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”
“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,
and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit
would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running
up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened
the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out--
“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make
haste, and come down this moment.”
Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in
quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.
“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
daughter.”
“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not
Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;
the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little
creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?”
“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
Why does she not come in?”
“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours
when Miss de Bourgh comes in.”
“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She
looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will
make him a very proper wife.”
Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was
stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness
before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that
way.
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day.
Chapter 29
Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity
of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.
“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately
after your arrival!”
“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,
“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”
Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what
they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--
“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion
for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you
for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved.”
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of
her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
to his presentation at St. James's.
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a
mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.
Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady
Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought
she could witness without trepidation.
From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they
followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady
Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,
with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had
settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should
be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those
apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.
In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked
features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not
conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by
silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,
as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to
Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she
believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her
being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,
and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
looking at in the summer.
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and
all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had
likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her
ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing
she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to
be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to
have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as
to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse
with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been
her mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of
her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then
observed,
“Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your
sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?”
“A little.”
“Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it
some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”
“One of them does.”
“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do
you draw?”
“No, not at all.”
“What, none of you?”
“Not one.”
“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”
“My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.”
“Has your governess left you?”
“We never had any governess.”
“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education.”
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been
the case.
“Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you
must have been neglected.”
“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be
idle, certainly might.”
“Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces
of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day that I recommended another young person,
who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's
calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”
“Yes, ma'am, all.”
“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The
younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters
must be very young?”
“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be
much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would
not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”
“Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”
“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.
“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not
conceal your age.”
“I am not one-and-twenty.”
When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables
were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her
party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson
expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the
other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins
was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.
Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by
the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon
as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin
to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for
Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her
commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy
Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise
into his own hands.
Chapter 30
Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled,
and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his
morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but
when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast
and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in
reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,
which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and
had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed upon to get out.
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.
Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in
commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her
by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to
be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one
card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart
of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living
in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,
however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had
often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she
frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was
expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not
many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently
destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself.
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his
bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when
Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:
“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me.”
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him without saying a word.
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment's pause, added:
“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never
happened to see her there?”
She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between
the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.
Chapter 31
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures
of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little
of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the
Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen
only at church.
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received
them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,
as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a
while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out:
“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking
of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”
“We are speaking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.
“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,
I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed
delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”
Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.
“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady
Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel
if she does not practice a good deal.”
“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.
She practises very constantly.”
“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often
tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she
will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told
her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.
Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part
of the house.”
Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and made
no answer.
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He
drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away
from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:
“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There
is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the
will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
me.”
“I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could not
really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have
had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find
great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are
not your own.”
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part
of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of
credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all
that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to
say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such
things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”
“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.
“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”
“You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced
only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain
knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a
partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.”
“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party.”
“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”
“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I sought an
introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”
“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?”
“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to
him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”
“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,
“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done.”
“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the
trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution.”
Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your
time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy:
“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the
gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was
ready to take them all home.
Chapter 32
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to
be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and
Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were
to be within.
They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and
feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed:
“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”
“Perfectly so, I thank you.”
She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short
pause added:
“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again?”
“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and
is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing.”
“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for
the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same
principle.”
“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers.”
Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.
He took the hint, and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable
house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
Collins first came to Hunsford.”
“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object.”
“Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”
“Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one
of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the
wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.”
“It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends.”
“An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”
“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's
journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.”
“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins
was settled _near_ her family.”
“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”
As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:
“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the
case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance.”
Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have
been always at Longbourn.”
Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:
“Are you pleased with Kent?”
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised
them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to anybody, went away.
“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone. “My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never
have called us in this familiar way.”
But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot
always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,
it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice
to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really
animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect
of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself
seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.
Chapter 33
More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,
unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to
prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that
it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,
therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like
wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He
never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third
rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about
her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of
Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to
expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying
_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel
Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed
her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the Parsonage.
She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter,
and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in
spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw
on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the
letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:
“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”
“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are
you going much farther?”
“No, I should have turned in a moment.”
And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together.
“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.
“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He
arranges the business just as he pleases.”
“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”
“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it
than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak
feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence.”
“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”
“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where
they like.”
“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do.”
“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many
in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money.”
“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what
is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”
He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said:
“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her.”
“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must
divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”
“Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your
charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way.”
As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:
“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”
“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he
is a great friend of Darcy's.”
“Oh! yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”
“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”
“What is it you mean?”
“It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,
because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an
unpleasant thing.”
“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”
“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing
him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”
“Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?”
“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady.”
“And what arts did he use to separate them?”
“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He
only told me what I have now told you.”
Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.
“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?”
“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”
“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.
But,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case.”
“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but it is a
lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.”
This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture
of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent
matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There
could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have
such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had
always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement
of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was
the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had
suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while
every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the
world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.
“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel
Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in London.
“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of
objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither
could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and
respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought of
her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow
that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose
pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of
importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense;
and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed
by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.
Bingley for his sister.
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to
her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather
displeased by her staying at home.
Chapter 34
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself
as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her
a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation
to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the
next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should
herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of
her spirits, by all that affection could do.
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.
But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but
said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her
in an agitated manner, and thus began:
“In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be
repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
you.”
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;
and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,
immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always
opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to
the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
suit.
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she
lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite
of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt
of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but
his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could
only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said:
“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should
be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I
cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be
of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented
the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in
overcoming it after this explanation.”
Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance
of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed
himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings
dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:
“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!
I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”
“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a desire
of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have
other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against
you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you
think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has
been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most
beloved sister?”
As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued:
“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,
you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind.”
She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.
“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.
With assumed tranquillity he then replied: “I have no wish of denying
that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself.”
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.
“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike
is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to
say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”
“You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,” said Darcy,
in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.
“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?”
“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed.”
“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You have reduced
him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have
withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for
him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and
ridicule.”
“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!
I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,” added he, stopping in
his walk, and turning towards her, “these offenses might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater
policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of
my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and
just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said:
“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern
which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more
gentlemanlike manner.”
She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:
“You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
would have tempted me to accept it.”
Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:
“From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of
my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of
the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”
“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness.”
And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.
The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how
to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for
half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,
was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for
so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of
all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying
her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his
own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired
unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable
pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to
Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could
not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.
Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon
overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for
a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the
sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to
encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.
Chapter 35
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything
else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after
breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The
park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
of the gates into the ground.
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.
Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though
in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the
gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,
“I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” And then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise
full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--
“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension
of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those
offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any
intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes
which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand
your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
demand it of your justice.
“Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,
that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley
from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various
claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young
persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could
bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope
to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions
and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which
is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity
must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.
“I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young
woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance
at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious
attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I
had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir
William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to
your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could
be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour
attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss
Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also
watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,
but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced
from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions
with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been
in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter
probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict
pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not
scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and
air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction
that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be
easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is
certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions
are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe
her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial
conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the
marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have
the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of
connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But
there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still
existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had
myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before
me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your
mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that
total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by
herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your
father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern
for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this
representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to
have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,
is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than
it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say
farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties
was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led
me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as
you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.
“The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness
had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was
soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in
detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in
London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office
of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I
described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance
might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose
that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your
sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his
affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great
natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his
own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was
no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into
Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the
work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There
is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not
reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the
measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in
town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her
brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without
ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me
enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this
concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it
was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no
other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it
was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to
you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn
them.
“With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured
Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his
connection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I
am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more
than one witness of undoubted veracity.
“Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many
years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good
conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to
be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his
kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at
school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his
own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only
fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he
had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be
his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is
many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different
manner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was
careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape
the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,
and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.
Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree
you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham
has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from
unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.
“My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to
Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly
recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner
that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a
valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There
was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long
survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham
wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,
he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more
immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he
could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying
law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed
him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to
his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the
business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance
in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection
between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him
to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly
lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free
from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.
For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the
incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to
me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured
me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He
had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely
resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in
question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was
well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not
have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame
me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every
repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of
his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every
appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.
“I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,
and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold
to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your
secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to
the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.
About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed
for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided
over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by
design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him
and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and
by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to
her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and
to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her
excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed
the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two
before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the
idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and
how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented
any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place
immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which
is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of
revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have
been complete indeed.
“This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have
been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as
false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.
Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he
had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered
at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,
detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in
your inclination.
“You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but
I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to
be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more
particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our
near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of
the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_
should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by
the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be
the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some
opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the
morning. I will only add, God bless you.
“FITZWILLIAM DARCY”
Chapter 36
If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation
to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong
prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what
had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly
left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the
next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of
the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she
instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst
objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing
him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied
her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and
insolence.
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when
she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her
feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what
he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though
she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own
words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the
will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down
the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read
on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at
Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As
to his real character, had information been in her power, she had
never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried
to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of
Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But
no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss
Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration.
She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's.
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;
that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's
character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would
always prevent his exposing the son.
How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not
but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his
actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,
absurd.
“How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have prided myself
on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified
my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this
discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could
not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my
folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.”
From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation
_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that
credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's
opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his
description of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were
little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air
and manner not often united with great sensibility.
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.
The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been
self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered
that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she
had ever known before.
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made
her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish
of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.
She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern
in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object; she could think only of her letter.
Chapter 37
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then
hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as
her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship's indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how
would she have behaved?” were questions with which she amused herself.
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. “I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe no one
feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly
attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to
me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The
dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His
attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”
Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:
“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that
you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your
company, I am sure.”
“I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied
Elizabeth, “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town
next Saturday.”
“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected
you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There
can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight.”
“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”
“Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as
Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.”
“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan.”
Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant
with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.
You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in
the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly
guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my
niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her
having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of
Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those
things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I
am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be
discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”
“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”
“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?
Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be
attended to.”
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary
walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.
Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She
studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,
or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there
forever.
Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's
explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,
heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved
to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How
grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every
respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had
been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!
When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent
there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.
Chapter 38
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.
“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We
know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly.”
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She
had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling
solemnity replied:
“It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately
having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,
from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the
humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford
visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to
Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage
and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You
see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge
that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should
not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are
sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.
“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each
other.”
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.
Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she
had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that
her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her
home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their
dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her
with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.
“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here.”
Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.
“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, “it seems
but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
happened!”
“A great many indeed,” said her companion with a sigh.
“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
How much I shall have to tell!”
Elizabeth added privately, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”
Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner's
house, where they were to remain a few days.
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her
aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.
It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried
into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister
further.
Chapter 39
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage
was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
dressing a salad and cucumber.
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
“Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?”
“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia, “but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then, showing
her purchases--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think
it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better.”
And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, “Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight.”
“Are they indeed!” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.
“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;
and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to
go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!”
“Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,
and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”
“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down at
table. “What do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about
a certain person we all like!”
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need
not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:
“Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse
things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad
he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for
my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”
“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune.”
“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”
“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.
“I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared
three straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled
thing?”
Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and
Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.
“How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia. “I am glad I bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any
flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a
lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.
Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”
With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did
Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.
Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth:
“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”
Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that
occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and
poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one
hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat
some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger
Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's,
was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
would hear her.
“Oh! Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there
was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty
had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved
very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated
you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never
should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then
we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that
anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”
To this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for
_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.”
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk
to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily
opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could
not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.
There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.
Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The
comfort to _her_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond
expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.
She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.
Chapter 40
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could
no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every
particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be
surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene
between Mr. Darcy and herself.
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was
sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.
“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment!”
“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”
“Blame you! Oh, no.”
“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”
“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”
“But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next
day.”
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear the one without involving the other.
“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both
of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's;
but you shall do as you choose.”
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.
“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so
very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing
of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it
so.”
“Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather.”
“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!”
“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it.”
“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do.”
“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually
abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”
“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now.”
“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And
with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say
that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I
had! Oh! how I wanted you!”
“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved.”
“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There
is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand
Wickham's character.”
Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?”
“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me
to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular
relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy
is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in
Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal
to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to
anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,
and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At
present I will say nothing about it.”
“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other
half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one
could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off
this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if that very
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to
tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!”
She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a
very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself
in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,
and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first
attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,
and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her
attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the
indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own
health and their tranquillity.
“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But
I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is
a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of
his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of
everybody, too, who is likely to know.”
“I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”
“Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I
shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I
would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will
die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.”
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.
“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope
it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her
mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say.”
“No, nothing at all.”
“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ will
take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed
for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as
quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”
“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”
“No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they
often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”
Chapter 41
The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was
the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies
in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.
“Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?”
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years
ago.
“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel
Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.”
“I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.
“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.
“Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
disagreeable.”
“A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”
“And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”
 added Kitty.
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's
objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of
the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,
the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia
flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.
“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”
 said she, “Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:
“Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so
little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances.”
“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to
us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently in the affair.”
“Already arisen?” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What, has she frightened away
some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who
have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly.”
“Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not
of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our
importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness
of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger
Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?”
Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and
affectionately taking her hand said in reply:
“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly
sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find
women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest
of her life.”
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on
them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret
over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye
of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.
She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them
at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.
Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such
realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have
been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy
conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving
home.
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted
her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined,
with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,
asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:
“How long did you say he was at Rosings?”
“Nearly three weeks.”
“And you saw him frequently?”
“Yes, almost every day.”
“His manners are very different from his cousin's.”
“Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.”
“Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. “And
pray, may I ask?--” But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is
it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility
to his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,” he continued in a lower
and more serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”
“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much
what he ever was.”
While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added:
“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents:
“You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only
deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only
fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been
alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good
opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always
operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be
imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I
am certain he has very much at heart.”
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his
side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which
there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in
the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more
gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.
Chapter 42
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,
esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views
of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of
a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties
abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all
her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what
has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been
looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the
scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.
“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”
When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to
the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still
less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were
much too full of lines under the words to be made public.
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore
a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of
June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by
the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton.
The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak.
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.
With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.”
The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their
cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.
The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the
next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.
One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are
sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's
former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance
still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the
principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,
Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not
in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed
an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.
“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard
so much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many of your
acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know.”
Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She
must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so
many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.
Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house
richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but
the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the
country.”
Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such
a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved
that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the
absence of the family were unfavourably answered.
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its
proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.
Chapter 43
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for
half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of
high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They
followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which
they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,
was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and
she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its
banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,
with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking
different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be
seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to
the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of
his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.
“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,”--recollecting
herself--“that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”
This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like
regret.
She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really
absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question
was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.
Reynolds replied that he was, adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with
a large party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the
likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young
gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought
up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the army,” she added;
“but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”
Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it.
“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago.”
“I have heard much of your master's fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,
looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not.”
Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.
“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”
Elizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”
“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?”
“Yes, very handsome.”
“I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late
master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then. He was very fond of them.”
This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.
Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.
“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs. Gardiner.
“Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is
a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him.”
Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either
by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.
“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”
“Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”
“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”
“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”
“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is
good enough for him.”
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”
“I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,”
 replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she
listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, “I have
never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever
since he was four years old.”
This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was
grateful to her uncle for saying:
“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in
having such a master.”
“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could
not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and
he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the
world.”
Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.
“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.
“Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor.”
Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.
Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.
“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever
lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but
themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give
him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw
anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away
like other young men.”
“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.
“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”
“Perhaps we might be deceived.”
“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”
On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty
sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to
give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when
last at Pemberley.
“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.
Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter
the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever
can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There
is nothing he would not do for her.”
The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were
all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of
the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested
her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a
smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he
looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest
contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.
Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's
lifetime.
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of
their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds
was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how
much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of
good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his
eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.
As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former
was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.
She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer
she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the
alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that
he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in
her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent
had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as
to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in
Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.
At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.
The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but
Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,
followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her
coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the
world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light
might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely
thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he
thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes
sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;
for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted
from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over
the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly
altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was
amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never
had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What
a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put
his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account
for it.
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and
seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then
was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,
she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was
not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in
seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of
the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the
valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading
many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish
of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.
With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which
brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,
to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed
it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the
valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,
and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the
bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only
of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the
man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment
was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here
less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before
they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared
for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,
and she said no more.
Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;
and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had
revolted in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought
she, “when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of
fashion.”
The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the
connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and
so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.
The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time
to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was
walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment
must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and
continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what can
it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his
manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a
change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.”
After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to
the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated
in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him
to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected
in the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They
will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last
mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_
mind was not very differently engaged.
“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a
pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at Lambton?”
The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her
must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.
They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.
He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but
there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected
that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale
with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her
patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was
over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go
into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and
they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the
ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him
walking slowly towards the house.
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.
“He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.
“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her
aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I
have seen nothing of it.”
“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”
“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;
or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features
are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so
disagreeable?”
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.
“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied
her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off
his grounds.”
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but
said nothing.
“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the
good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal
master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every
virtue.”
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in
as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from
his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.
Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of
anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they
had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a
intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.
Chapter 44
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in
a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing
the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her
surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that
there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a
quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite
amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,
she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much
in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.
They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley
was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick
step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All
Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still
felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He
inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked
and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.
To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards
each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew
what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little
in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and
to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in
a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,
though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his
behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred
between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point
she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred
ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a
recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying
more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed
to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone
which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since
he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply,
he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of
November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether
_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,
nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which
gave them meaning.
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;
but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed
from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion
of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was
so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company
of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations
at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance
could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
Rosings.
Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose
to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their
visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.
But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was
much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.
Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could
not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had
nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,
it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town
where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he
was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the
son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;
and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She
certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in
his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.
It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,
but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and
acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations
accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid
her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most
eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display
of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only
were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent
on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much
pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent
love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a
sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be
exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,
she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how
far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would
be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her
fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of
his addresses.
It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the
very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a
late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,
by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that
it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when
she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.
Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.
Chapter 45
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how
much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.
On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.
In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with
all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear
of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior
the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,
however, did her justice, and pitied her.
By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the
others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss
Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many
a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole
party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected
them round the table.
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:
“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;
but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While
she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would
have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies
and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected
with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's
meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy
was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections
her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very
wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss
Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,
behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's
recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not
err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana
without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When
Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to
him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.
“How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she
cried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since
the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing
that we should not have known her again.”
However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.
“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could
see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose
wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,
which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything
extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do
not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable.”
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued:
“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_
a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time.”
“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_
was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”
He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.
Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them
both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked
of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but
himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of
him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's
beginning the subject.
Chapter 46
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and
her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been
written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:
“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be
assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland
with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our
surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am
very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing
to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step
(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is
disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How
thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against
him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about
twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have
passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect
him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of
their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor
mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly
know what I have written.”
Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.
“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I
wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my
head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest
Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,
and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham
and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has
taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the
day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short
letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna
Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was
repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.
intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,
but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney
coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that
is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.
I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that
side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing
them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but
without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With
the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions
to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved
for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our
distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the
worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make
it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue
their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a
young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose
her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that
Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his
head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to
be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she
exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And
as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has
anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of
confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you
have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the
first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not
so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I
take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but
circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to
come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,
that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something
more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel
Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure
I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any
measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to
be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my
uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will
immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”
“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing
a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was
opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,
she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation,
hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find
Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not
an instant to lose.”
“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;
but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are
not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”
Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless
an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home instantly.
On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you
present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”
“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There
is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”
She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence. At length she spoke again. “I have just had a letter from Jane,
with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger
sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into
the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no
connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”
Darcy was fixed in astonishment. “When I consider,” she added in a yet
more agitated voice, “that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what
he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I
learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not
have happened. But it is all--all too late now.”
“I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved--shocked. But is it
certain--absolutely certain?”
“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
Scotland.”
“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”
“My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But
nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is
such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have
not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.
“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”
Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking
up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air
gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her
power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed
up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by
the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything
could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to
such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may
seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I
fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley
to-day.”
“Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.”
He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting look, went away.
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as
had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full
of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if
otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on
a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him
go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained
a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least
of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first
letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry
for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment
as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose
Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention
of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue
nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one
officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been
fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now
feel it!
She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's
account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them
instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their
summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript
of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a
favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply
afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the
first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every
assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked
him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,
everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to
be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be done about Pemberley?”
 cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for
us; was it so?”
“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
_That_ is all settled.”
“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”
But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.
Chapter 47
“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the
matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I
am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is
not adequate to the risk!”
“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.
“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle's
opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of
Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?”
“Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other
neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I
dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been
the case?”
“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland.”
“Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such
a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
Barnet road.”
“Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.”
“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular
friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He
cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has
no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter.”
“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him
as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?”
“It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, “that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.
Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,
nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing
everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman.”
“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very ill of
Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”
“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”
“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.
“I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you, the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other
circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From
what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her.”
“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?”
“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could
it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was
settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening
her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be
in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a
consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far
enough from my thoughts.”
“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”
“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for
the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular
attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,
who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”
                          * * * * *
It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.
They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night
on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her
mother's apartment, immediately met her.
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
heard of the fugitives.
“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
everything will be well.”
“Is my father in town?”
“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”
“And have you heard from him often?”
“We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write
again till he had something of importance to mention.”
“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”
“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven, are quite well.”
“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you
must have gone through!”
Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach
of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of
good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.
Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes'
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;
blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must principally be owing.
“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia
had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been
well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the
charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!
And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,
wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become
of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his
grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we
shall do.”
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her
that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.
“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we
may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make
him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done.”
“Oh! my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I
could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,
after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my
wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such
spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that
I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to
give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does
not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I
know you will contrive it all.”
But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well
in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on
the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The
faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible
in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger
which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of
fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was
mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance
of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:
“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”
Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one
false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in
her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed
to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for
half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of
the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued
the subject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which
I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel
Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”
“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so
grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”
“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”
“Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of
their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.”
“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”
“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt
a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him
in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter
she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their
being in love with each other, many weeks.”
“But not before they went to Brighton?”
“No, I believe not.”
“And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does
he know his real character?”
“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;
but I hope this may be false.”
“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!”
“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister. “But to expose
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.”
“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his
wife?”
“He brought it with him for us to see.”
Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These
were the contents:
“MY DEAR HARRIET,
“You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,
I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I
love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think
it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my
going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,
when I write to them and sign my name 'Lydia Wickham.' What a good joke
it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to
Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will
dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall
send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell
Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are
packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will
drink to our good journey.
“Your affectionate friend,
“LYDIA BENNET.”
“Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!
But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their
journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her
side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”
“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!”
“Oh! Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”
“I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so
much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties.”
“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look
well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone.”
“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.
Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn
on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And
Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', if
they should be of use to us.”
“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see
too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence
insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”
She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.
“He meant I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could
be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come
with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might
be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any
other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this.”
Chapter 48
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,
to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.
Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable
to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.
Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less
of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come
when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely
despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of
them.
Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a
letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;
that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,
but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised
to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:
“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were
anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a
clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have
nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,
Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any
other person.”
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her
authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information
of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never
heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both
of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of
his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;
and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application
was a something to look forward to.
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters
was the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.
But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as
follows:
“MY DEAR SIR,
“I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from
Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself
sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in
your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because
proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be
wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that
may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the
most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would
have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to
be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte
informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,
for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think
that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be
guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,
you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined
by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to
whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that
this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of
all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,
will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads
me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event
of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved
in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to
console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child
from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her
own heinous offense.
“I am, dear sir, etc., etc.”
Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he
kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one
living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he
had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of
particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,
who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the
wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for
secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for
it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a
very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a
thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.
He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more
formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars
from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!”
 she cried. “This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.”
Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded
to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.
“What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he
will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?”
As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet
came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.
Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His
name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and
the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their
being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had
received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.
The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.
When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.
It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say
nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it.”
“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.
“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone
to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
It will pass away soon enough.”
“Do you suppose them to be in London?”
“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”
“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.
“She is happy then,” said her father drily; “and her residence there
will probably be of some duration.”
Then after a short silence he continued:
“Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me
last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
tea.
“This is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my
library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”
“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully. “If I should
ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”
“_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne
for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into
my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be
absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have
spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.”
Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.
“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them.”
Chapter 49
Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”
“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”
“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don't you know
there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
this half-hour, and master has had a letter.”
Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the
library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said:
“If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse.”
Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once
more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.
Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out:
“Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?”
“Yes I have had a letter from him by express.”
“Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”
“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from
his pocket. “But perhaps you would like to read it.”
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.
“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is
about.”
“Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.
“MY DEAR BROTHER,
“At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,
upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you
left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of
London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough
to know they are discovered. I have seen them both--”
“Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are married!”
Elizabeth read on:
“I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there
was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the
engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will
not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure
to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand
pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and
my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,
during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions
which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,
as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You
will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there
will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to
settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude
will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout
the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to
Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the
smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at
Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as
fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it
best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope
you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as
anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,
“EDW. GARDINER.”
“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be
possible that he will marry her?”
“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said her
sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”
“And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.
“No; but it must be done soon.”
Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.
“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.
Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”
“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble
yourself.”
“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”
And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.
“And may I ask--” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with.”
“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”
“And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!”
“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there
are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever
to pay him.”
“Money! My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”
“I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone.”
“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me
before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!
it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”
“No,” said her father; “Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,
in the very beginning of our relationship.”
“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
repaid?”
Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.
“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves. “How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be
thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!”
“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would
not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children
of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand
pounds?”
“If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,” said
Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never
be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is
actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!”
“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said
Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to
marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten.”
“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor
I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly
replied:
“Just as you please.”
“May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?”
“Take whatever you like, and get away.”
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs
together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication
would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,
the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As
soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon
married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter
would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her
felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.
“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried. “This is delightful indeed! She will
be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!
My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage
everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him
how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear
Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.
“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great
measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
assist Mr. Wickham with money.”
“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!
In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well
it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and
you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.
“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call
on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do
anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”
Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was
no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could
be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had
feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had
gained.
Chapter 50
Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever
of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
her husband might then have rested in its proper place.
He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he
was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.
When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he
would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then
too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with
regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,
though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would
be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her
through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within
that sum.
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as
little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon
dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick
in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any
message to her.
The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage
of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant
farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery
was considered certain.
It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object
of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.
“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings could quit it--or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: “Mrs.
Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the
impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”
A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It
soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe
possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they
took place.
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the
proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.
She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's
frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear
of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,
there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other
objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.
From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that
she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they
should meet.
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she
must have received benefit of greater importance.
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.
                          * * * * *
Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal
purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.
“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as
his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in
considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on
his account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into
the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who
are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an
ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It
is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He
promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each
have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have
written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,
and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham
in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I
have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin
a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I
hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,
and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,
unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
you and her mother.--Yours, etc.,
“E. GARDINER.”
Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal
from the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet
was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North,
just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,
for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with everybody, and had so many favourites.
“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking
to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s
regiment.”
His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,
received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,
who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show
her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the
North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent
his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as
the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was
surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and
had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would
have been the last object of her wishes.
Chapter 51
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to
meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their
arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,
who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she
been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
must endure.
They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,
to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.
Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet
was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,
and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the
two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.
There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.
“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away;
it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was.”
Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, “Oh! mamma, do the
people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;
and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he
should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took
off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that
he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.”
Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say
to her eldest sister, “Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
lower, because I am a married woman.”
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good
spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and
all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham”
 by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her
ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.
“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I
am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half
my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get
husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.”
“Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't
at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”
“Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all
things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We
shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some
balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.”
“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.
“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over.”
“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands.”
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.
No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.
Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected
to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of September, than any body else in the country.
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:
“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You
were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?”
“No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little said
on the subject.”
“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in
that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to
put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was
my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as
if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in
ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed
to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.”
“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was
rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so
just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon
business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once
they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I
did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we
were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he
came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However,
I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.”
“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.
“Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious
me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”
“If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the
subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”
“Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will
ask you no questions.”
“Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be angry.”
On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least
it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at
her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.
“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be
to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems
to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance.”
“Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, as she finished
the letter; “and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out.”
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad
of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.

Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it
than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to
be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to
be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.
“Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.
“MY DEAR NIECE,
“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning
to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise
what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your
application; I did not expect it from _you_. Don't think me angry,
however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such
inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to
understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised
as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really
innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.
“On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most
unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several
hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so
dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.
Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,
and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,
Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day
after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to
make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide
in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and
confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private
actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He
called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy
an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_
motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days
in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to
direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness
of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.
“There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago
governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause
of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large
house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting
lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with
Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to
town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and
corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.
Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had
she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up
their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the
wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and
afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he
acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful
situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed
on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But
he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared
for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear
of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or
other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,
it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,
in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never
been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,
on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and
scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her
own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as
to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He
must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
nothing to live on.
“Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though
Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able
to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by
marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still
cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in
some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely
to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.
“They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of
course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be
reasonable.
“Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to
make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch
street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be
seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was
still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge
your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your
uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the
departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next
day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.
“On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,
and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.
“They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all
settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to
Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that
obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been
accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and
I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your
uncle would most readily have settled the whole.
“They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either
the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle
was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his
niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter
this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation
that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where
it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane
at most.
“You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young
people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably
more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own
settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all
this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It
was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that
Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he
had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth
in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve,
can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,
my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would
never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another
interest_ in the affair.
“When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who
were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in
London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were
then to receive the last finish.
“I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which
you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not
afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant
admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I
knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was
satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not
perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming
home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell
you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most
serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had
done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she
heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was
sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and
Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.
“Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,
attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave
town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my
dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,
in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His
understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little
more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach
him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But
slyness seems the fashion.
“Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not
punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy
till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little
pair of ponies, would be the very thing.
“But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half
hour.
“Yours, very sincerely,
“M. GARDINER.”
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's
match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all
the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason
with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her
heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly
checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity
was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for
a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so
natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law
of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,
to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had
given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary
stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been
wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and
though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she
could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist
his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially
concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were
under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They
owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever
encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For
herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause
of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. It
was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some
pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she
and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted
between Mr. Darcy and herself.
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by Wickham.
“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,
as he joined her.
“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome.”
“I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and
now we are better.”
“True. Are the others coming out?”
“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley.”
She replied in the affirmative.
“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”
“Yes, she did.”
“And what did she say?”
“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented.”
“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:
“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”
“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said
Elizabeth. “It must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year.”
“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had.”
“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”
“And do you like her?”
“Very much.”
“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad
you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”
“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”
“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”
“I do not recollect that we did.”
“I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
me in every respect.”
“How should you have liked making sermons?”
“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,
and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The
quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas
of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in Kent?”
“I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”
“You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
first, you may remember.”
“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not
so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly.”
“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”
They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:
“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let
us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind.”
She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.
Chapter 53
Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.
“Oh! my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”
“Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”
“Write to me very often, my dear.”
“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for
writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to
do.”
Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to
us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”
The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.
“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”
“This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,” said
Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single.”
“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper
at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several
weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and
smiled and shook her head by turns.
“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.
Phillips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not
that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am
sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome
to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?
But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?”
“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was in
Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He
comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was
going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:
“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from
any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that
I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes
alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of
_myself_, but I dread other people's remarks.”
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.
“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot
come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”
In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.
“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you
will wait on him of course.”
“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again.”
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield.
“'Tis an etiquette I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society,
let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours
in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again.”
“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I
am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will
make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
him.”
Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before
_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--
“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she
says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!”
“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it
is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
always so much.”
Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his
arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock and ride towards the house.
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.
“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”
“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know.”
“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man.”
“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of
Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him.”
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either
of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,
and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as
what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.
“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early
enough for expectation.”
She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of
her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,
she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.
Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.
Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter
the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,
was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.
Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He
was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but
it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,
when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without
bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often
found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but
the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry
with herself for being so.
“Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she. “Yet why did he come?”
She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.
She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.
“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.
He readily agreed to it.
“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my
own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,
George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”
Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.
“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”
 continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay
I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have
heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves.”
Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such
misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.
“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,
“I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.
Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you.”
Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion.
“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to
be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!”
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and
as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time.
“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement.”
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.
Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year.
Chapter 54
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.
“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,
“did he come at all?”
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
“He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If
he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will
think no more about him.”
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.
“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance.”
“Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane,
take care.”
“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?”
“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever.”
                          * * * * *
They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
revived.
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality
as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore
to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided. He placed himself by her.
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;
and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the
family.
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious
and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her
uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.
“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for
ever.”
The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:
“The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;
do we?”
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with
her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly!
“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!”
She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:
“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”
“Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.”
“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”
“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
these three weeks.”
She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.
When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,
when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.
Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.
“Well girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “What
say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so
fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
Lucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And
what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her
at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”
Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.
“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
may often meet again.”
Elizabeth smiled.
“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am
perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had
any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed
with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing, than any other man.”
“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment.”
“How hard it is in some cases to be believed!”
“And how impossible in others!”
“But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?”
“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.”
Chapter 55
A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.
“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”
He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.
“Can you come to-morrow?”
Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.
He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:
“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is
come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss
Lizzy's hair.”
“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.”
“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!
Where is your sash, my dear?”
But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.
The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of
the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter mamma? What do
you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”
“Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still
five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, “Come here, my love, I want to
speak to you,” took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look
at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her
entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.
Bennet half-opened the door and called out:
“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”
Elizabeth was forced to go.
“We may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her mother, as
soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in
my dressing-room.”
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.
Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence.
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent
the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption
or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.
But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would
have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she
thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.
“'Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!
why is not everybody as happy?”
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,
a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said for the present.
“I must go instantly to my mother;” she cried. “I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family! how shall I bear so much happiness!”
She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.
“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!”
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.
“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.
“With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”
He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed
her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with
great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when
Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
how really happy he was.
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter, and said:
“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”
Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.
“You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income.”
“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in me.”
“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you
talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so
happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!”
Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself
obliged to accept.
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours
of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he
always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.
“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed
it possible.”
“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for
it?”
“It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other.”
“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever
heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.”
“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!”
“He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty.”
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased
to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,
though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she
knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.
“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried
Jane. “Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
such another man for you!”
“If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,
and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.
Chapter 56
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up
the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.
Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,
“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
mother.”
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
“And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.”
“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.
“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man
who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”
“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence.
“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I
assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.”
“This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west.”
Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then
added:
“May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and
Mrs. Collins well.”
“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.
Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,
“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company.”
“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the
different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”
Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the
hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.
“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in
her face.
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--
“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come.”
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
“Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here.”
“Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to
know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved
on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you.”
“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?”
“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”
“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth
coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence.”
“If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?”
“I never heard that it was.”
“And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?”
“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may
ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.”
“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”
“Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”
“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
may have drawn him in.”
“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”
“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”
“But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,
ever induce me to be explicit.”
“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?”
“Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me.”
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:
“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his
tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest
hours he was destined for his cousin?”
“Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is
no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not
be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to
marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither
by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”
“Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,
Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us.”
“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine.”
“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will
I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's
whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”
“_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on me.”
“I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on
both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,
or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in
which you have been brought up.”
“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are
equal.”
“True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother?
Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition.”
“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”
“Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?”
Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation:
“I am not.”
Lady Catherine seemed pleased.
“And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?”
“I will make no promise of the kind.”
“Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that
I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the
assurance I require.”
“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their
marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would
my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have
supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the
application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if
you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your
nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,
therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.”
“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am
no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is
such a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his
late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are
you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”
“You can now have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.
“You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to
the house.”
And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.
“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”
“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”
“You are then resolved to have him?”
“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”
“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”
“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn.”
“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.
I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.”
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, “I take no leave
of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve
no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”
Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.
“She did not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.”
“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were
well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.
Chapter 57
The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report
of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours
at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had
only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked
forward to as possible at some future time.
In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.
If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.
“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand
it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his
constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all.”
                          * * * * *
The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.
The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.
“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you; come into my room.”
She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to
tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it
might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He
then said,
“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink
of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued:
“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”
“From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”
“Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may
be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in
this land.'
“Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? 'This young
gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of.'
“Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:
“'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine
that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye.'
“_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie
more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his
life! It is admirable!”
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.
“Are you not diverted?”
“Oh! yes. Pray read on.”
“'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' Mr.
Collins moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,
as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his notion of Christian
forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,
I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?”
“Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I am excessively diverted. But it is so
strange!”
“Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any
consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by
his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.
Chapter 58
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's
visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time
to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat
in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the
habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five
set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others
to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy
were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty
was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said:
“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my
poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest
of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”
“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner
was so little to be trusted.”
“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them.”
“If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.
That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought
only of _you_.”
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever.”
Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.
They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to
be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise
from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.
“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.”
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough
of my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations.”
“What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my
behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was
unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”
“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
in civility.”
“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you can
scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,
I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”
“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way.”
“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me.”
“Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at
all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”
Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he, “did it soon make you
think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?”
She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.
“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me.”
“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies.”
“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit.”
“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The
adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now
so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some
of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure.”
“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude
which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish
being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I
was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I
was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt
by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all
that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught
me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family
circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least
to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I
was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been
but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You
taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,
I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.
You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
worthy of being pleased.”
“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”
“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses.”
“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure
you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?”
“Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction.”
“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”
“No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.”
“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”
“My object then,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility in
my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to
obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
hour after I had seen you.”
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.
“What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!” was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.
“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.
“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”
“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.
“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a
confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I
told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had
the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.
“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”
“From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.”
“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him.”
“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was
angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me
now.”
Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,
and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness
of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they
parted.
Chapter 59
“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,
and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to
say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt
in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no
one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.
At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.
“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.”
“This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and
I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am
in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are
engaged.”
Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
you dislike him.”
“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as
these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself.”
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.
“Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,” cried
Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you
certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?”
“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,
Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?”
“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you
really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than
marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?”
“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all.”
“What do you mean?”
“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am
afraid you will be angry.”
“My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let
me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me
how long you have loved him?”
“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley.”
Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances
of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
further to wish.
“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself.
I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you,
I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
of it to another, not to you.”
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling
to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.
                          * * * * *
“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's
way.”
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”
“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has
never seen the view.”
“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?” Kitty owned that
she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see
the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went
up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:
“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking
to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to
inconvenience.”
During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be
asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit
to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear
the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.
                          * * * * *
In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, “Go to your father, he
wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,
of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.
“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.
But will they make you happy?”
“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my
indifference?”
“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him.”
“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “I love him.
Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms.”
“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he
condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know
your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
about.”
Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and
at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object
of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of
him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection
was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months'
suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did
conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.
“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to
say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”
To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.
“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble
and economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;
for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to
utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could
comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit
what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in
her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.
“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so
pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my
dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I
hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing
that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.”
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.
“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else! Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a
special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,
that I may have it to-morrow.”
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'
consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to
him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her
deference for his opinion.
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.
“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane's.”
Chapter 60
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could
you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?”
“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I
knew that I _had_ begun.”
“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence?”
“For the liveliness of your mind, I did.”
“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really
amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for
it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love.”
“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was
ill at Netherfield?”
“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it
by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?”
“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”
“But I was embarrassed.”
“And so was I.”
“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”
“A man who had felt less, might.”
“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.
_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject. This will never do.”
“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour
to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.”
“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to
Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
or had you intended any more serious consequence?”
“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,
and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”
“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to
befall her?”
“I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it
ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be
done directly.”
“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's
long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and
aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:
“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the
truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.
But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your
fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the
subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you
cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a
great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,
for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your
idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I
am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she
only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that
he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.
Yours, etc.”
Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still
different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply
to his last.
“DEAR SIR,
“I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon
be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.
“Yours sincerely, etc.”
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,
was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.
Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations
to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this
sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered
so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of
her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.
Mrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his
forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep
him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing
to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
Pemberley.
Chapter 61
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride
she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may
be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many
of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,
amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it
was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity
in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a
temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example,
she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite
unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this
effect:
“MY DEAR LIZZY,
“I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear
Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so
rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not
think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.
Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,
do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.
“Yours, etc.”
As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and
in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to Elizabeth.
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each
other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with
an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen
in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that
a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait
on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.

　　The Poems of Goethe
　　Translated in the original metresby Edgar Alfred Bowring
　　THE TRANSLATOR'S ORIGINAL DEDICATION.
　　TO THE COUNTESS GRANVILLE.
　　MY DEAR LADY GRANVILLE,--
　　THE reluctance which must naturally be felt by any one inventuring to give to the world a book such as the present, wherethe beauties of the great original must inevitably be diminished,if not destroyed, in the process of passing through thetranslator's hands, cannot but be felt in all its force when thattranslator has not penetrated beyond the outer courts of thepoetic fane, and can have no hope of advancing further, or ofreaching its sanctuary. But it is to me a subject of peculiarsatisfaction that your kind permission to have your nameinscribed upon this page serves to attain a twofold end--onedirect and personal, and relating to the present day; the otherreflected and historical, and belonging to times long gone by. Ofthe first little need now be said, for the privilege is whollymine, in making this dedication: as to the second, one word ofexplanation will suffice for those who have made the greatestpoet of Germany, almost of the world, their study, and to whomthe story of his life is not unknown. All who have followed thecareer of GOETHE are familiar with the name and character ofDALBERG, and also with the deep and lasting friendship thatexisted between them, from which SCHILLER too was not absent;recalling to the mind the days of old, when a Virgil and a Horaceand a Maecenas sat side by side.
　　Remembering, then, the connection that, in a former century,was formed and riveted between your illustrious ancestor and himwhom it is the object of these pages to represent, I deem it ahappy augury that the link then established finds itself notwholly severed even now (although its strength may beimmeasurably weakened in the comparison), inasmuch as this pagebrings them once more in contact, the one in the person of hisown descendant, the other in that of the translator of his Poems.
　　Believe me, with great truth,Very faithfully yours,EDGAR A. BOWRING.London, April, 1853.
　　ORIGINAL PREFACE.
　　I feel no small reluctance in venturing to give to the public awork of the character of that indicated by the title-page to thepresent volume; for, difficult as it must always be to rendersatisfactorily into one's own tongue the writings of the bards ofother lands, the responsibility assumed by the translator isimmeasurably increased when he attempts to transfer the thoughtsof those great men, who have lived for all the world and for allages, from the language in which they were originally clothed, toone to which they may as yet have been strangers. Preeminentlyis this the case with Goethe, the most masterly of all the masterminds of modern times, whose name is already inscribed on thetablets of immortality, and whose fame already extends over theearth, although as yet only in its infancy. Scarcely have twodecades passed away since he ceased to dwell among men, yet henow stands before us, not as a mere individual, like those whomthe world is wont to call great, but as a type, as an emblem--therecognised emblem and representative of the human mind in itspresent stage of culture and advancement.
　　Among the infinitely varied effusions of Goethe's pen, perhapsthere are none which are of as general interest as his Poems,which breathe the very spirit of Nature, and embody the realmusic of the feelings. In Germany, they are universally known,and are considered as the most delightful of his works. Yet inthis country, this kindred country, sprung from the same stem,and so strongly resembling her sister in so many points, they arenearly unknown. Almost the only poetical work of the greatestPoet that the world has seen for ages, that is really andgenerally read in England, is Faust, the translations of whichare almost endless; while no single person has as yet appeared toattempt to give, in an English dress, in any collective orsystematic manner, those smaller productions of the genius ofGoethe which it is the object of the present volume to lay beforethe reader, whose indulgence is requested for its manyimperfections. In addition to the beauty of the language in whichthe Poet has given utterance to his thoughts, there is a depth ofmeaning in those thoughts which is not easily discoverable atfirst sight, and the translator incurs great risk of overlookingit, and of giving a prosaic effect to that which in the originalcontains the very essence of poetry. It is probably thisdifficulty that has deterred others from undertaking the task Ihave set myself, and in which I do not pretend to do more thanattempt to give an idea of the minstrelsy of one so unrivalled,by as truthful an interpretation of it as lies in my power.
　　The principles which have guided me on the present occasion arethe same as those followed in the translation of Schiller'scomplete Poems that was published by me in 1851, namely, asliteral a rendering of the original as is consistent with goodEnglish, and also a very strict adherence to the metre of theoriginal. Although translators usually allow themselves greatlicense in both these points, it appears to me that by so doingthey of necessity destroy the very soul of the work they professto translate. In fact, it is not a translation, but a paraphrasethat they give. It may perhaps be thought that the presenttranslations go almost to the other extreme, and that a renderingof metre, line for line, and word for word, makes it impossibleto preserve the poetry of the original both in substance and insound. But experience has convinced me that it is not so, andthat great fidelity is even the most essential element ofsuccess, whether in translating poetry or prose. It was thereforevery satisfactory to me to find that the principle laid down byme to myself in translating Schiller met with the very general,if not universal, approval of the reader. At the same time, Ihave endeavoured to profit in the case of this, the younger bornof the two attempts made by me to transplant the muse of Germanyto the shores of Britain, by the criticisms, whether friendly orhostile, that have been evoked or provoked by the appearance ofits elder brother.
　　As already mentioned, the latter contained the whole of thePoems of Schiller. It is impossible, in anything like the samecompass, to give all the writings of Goethe comprised under thegeneral title of Gedichte, or poems. They contain between 30,000and 40,000 verses, exclusive of his plays. and similar works.Very many of these would be absolutely without interest to theEnglish reader,--such as those having only a local application,those addressed to individuals, and so on. Others again, fromtheir extreme length, could only be published in separatevolumes. But the impossibility of giving all need form noobstacle to giving as much as possible; and it so happens thatthe real interest of Goethe's Poems centres in those classes ofthem which are not too diffuse to run any risk when translated ofoffending the reader by their too great number. Those by far themore generally admired are the Songs and Ballads, which are about150 in number, and the whole of which are contained in thisvolume (with the exception of one or two of the former, whichhave been, on consideration, left out by me owing to theirtrifling and uninteresting nature). The same may be said of theOdes, Sonnets, Miscellaneous Poems, &c.
　　In addition to those portions of Goethe's poetical works whichare given in this complete form, specimens of the different otherclasses of them, such as the Epigrams, Elegies, &c., are added,as well as a collection of the various Songs found in his Plays,making a total number of about 400 Poems, embraced in the presentvolume.
　　A sketch of the life of Goethe is prefixed, in order that thereader may have before him both the Poet himself and the Poet'soffspring, and that he may see that the two are but one--thatGoethe lives in his works, that his works lived in him.
　　The dates of the different Poems are appended throughout, thatof the first publication being given, when that of thecomposition is unknown. The order of arrangement adopted is thatof the authorized German editions. As Goethe would never arrangethem himself in the chronological order of their composition, ithas become impossible to do so, now that he is dead. The planadopted in the present volume would therefore seem to be thebest, as it facilitates reference to the original. Thecircumstances attending or giving rise to the production of anyof the Poems will be found specified in those cases in which theyhave been ascertained by me.
　　Having said thus much by way of explanation, I now leave thebook to speak for itself, and to testify to its own character.Whether viewed with a charitable eye by the kindly reader, whowill make due allowance for the difficulties attending itsexecution, or received by the critic, who will judge of it onlyby its own merits, with the unfriendly welcome which it veryprobably deserves, I trust that I shall at least be pardoned formaking an attempt, a failure in which does not necessarily implydisgrace, and which, by leading the way, may perhaps become themeans of inducing some abler and more worthy (but not moreearnest) labourer to enter upon the same field, the riches ofwhich will remain unaltered and undiminished in value, evenalthough they may be for the moment tarnished by the hands of theless skilful workman who first endeavours to transplant them to aforeign soil.
　　PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.
　　I have taken advantage of the publication of a Second Editionof my translation of the Poems of Goethe (originally published in1853), to add to the Collection a version of the much admiredclassical Poem of Hermann and Dorothea, which was previouslyomitted by me in consequence of its length. Its universalpopularity, however, and the fact that it exhibits theversatility of Goethe's talents to a greater extent than,perhaps, any other of his poetical works, seem to call for itsadmission into the present volume.
　　On the other hand I have not thought it necessary to includethe sketch of Goethe's Life that accompanied the First Edition.At the time of its publication, comparatively little was known inthis country of the incidents of his career, and my sketch wasavowedly written as a temporary stop-gap, as it were, pending theproduction of some work really deserving the tittle of a life ofGoethe. Not to mention other contributions to the literature ofthe subject, Mr. Lewis's important volumes give the Englishreader all the information he is likely to require respectingGoethe's career, and my short memoir appeared to be no longerrequired.
　　I need scarcely add that I have availed myself of thisopportunity to make whatever improvements have suggestedthemselves to me in my original version of these Poems.

　　DEDICATION.
　　The morn arrived; his footstep quickly scared
　　The gentle sleep that round my senses clung,And I, awak'ning, from my cottage fared,
　　And up the mountain side with light heart sprung;At every step I felt my gaze ensnared
　　By new-born flow'rs that full of dew-drops hung;The youthful day awoke with ecstacy,And all things quicken'd were, to quicken me.
　　And as I mounted, from the valley rose
　　A streaky mist, that upward slowly spread,Then bent, as though my form it would enclose,
　　Then, as on pinions, soar'd above my head:My gaze could now on no fair view repose,
　　in mournful veil conceal'd, the world seem'd dead;The clouds soon closed around me, as a tomb,And I was left alone in twilight gloom.
　　At once the sun his lustre seem'd to pour,
　　And through the mist was seen a radiant light;Here sank it gently to the ground once more,
　　There parted it, and climb'd o'er wood and height.How did I yearn to greet him as of yore,
　　After the darkness waxing doubly bright!The airy conflict ofttimes was renew'd,Then blinded by a dazzling glow I stood.
　　Ere long an inward impulse prompted me
　　A hasty glance with boldness round to throw;At first mine eyes had scarcely strength to see,
　　For all around appear'd to burn and glow.Then saw I, on the clouds borne gracefully,
　　A godlike woman hov'ring to and fro.In life I ne'er had seen a form so fair--She gazed at me, and still she hover'd there.
　　"Dost thou not know me?" were the words she said
　　In tones where love and faith were sweetly bound;"Knowest thou not Her who oftentimes hath shed
　　The purest balsam in each earthly wound?Thou knows't me well; thy panting heart I led
　　To join me in a bond with rapture crown'd.Did I not see thee, when a stripling, yearningTo welcome me with tears, heartfelt and burning?"
　　"Yes!" I exclaim'd, whilst, overcome with joy,
　　I sank to earth; "I long have worshipp'd thee;Thou gav'st me rest, when passions rack'd the boy,
　　Pervading ev'ry limb unceasingly;Thy heav'nly pinions thou didst then employ
　　The scorching sunbeams to ward off from me.From thee alone Earth's fairest gifts I gain'd,Through thee alone, true bliss can be obtain'd.
　　"Thy name I know not; yet I hear thee nam'd
　　By many a one who boasts thee as his own;Each eye believes that tow'rd thy form 'tis aim'd,
　　Yet to most eyes thy rays are anguish-sown.Ah! whilst I err'd, full many a friend I claim'd,
　　Now that I know thee, I am left alone;With but myself can I my rapture share,I needs must veil and hide thy radiance fair.
　　She smiled, and answering said: "Thou see'st how wise,
　　How prudent 'twas but little to unveil!Scarce from the clumsiest cheat are clear'd thine eyes,
　　Scarce hast thou strength thy childish bars to scale,When thou dost rank thee 'mongst the deities,
　　And so man's duties to perform would'st fail!How dost thou differ from all other men?Live with the world in peace, and know thee then!"
　　"Oh, pardon me," I cried, "I meant it well:
　　Not vainly did'st thou bless mine eyes with light;For in my blood glad aspirations swell,
　　The value of thy gifts I know aright!Those treasures in my breast for others dwell,
　　The buried pound no more I'll hide from sight.Why did I seek the road so anxiously,If hidden from my brethren 'twere to be?"
　　And as I answer'd, tow'rd me turn'd her face,
　　With kindly sympathy, that god-like one;Within her eye full plainly could I trace
　　What I had fail'd in, and what rightly done.She smiled, and cured me with that smile's sweet grace,
　　To new-born joys my spirit soar'd anon;With inward confidence I now could dareTo draw yet closer, and observe her there.
　　Through the light cloud she then stretch'd forth her hand,
　　As if to bid the streaky vapour fly:At once it seemed to yield to her command,
　　Contracted, and no mist then met mine eye.My glance once more survey'd the smiling land,
　　Unclouded and serene appear'd the sky.Nought but a veil of purest white she held,And round her in a thousand folds it swell'd.
　　"I know thee, and I know thy wav'ring will.
　　I know the good that lives and glows in thee!"--Thus spake she, and methinks I hear her still--
　　"The prize long destined, now receive from me;That blest one will be safe from ev'ry ill,
　　Who takes this gift with soul of purity,--"The veil of Minstrelsy from Truth's own hand,Of sunlight and of morn's sweet fragrance plann'd.
　　"And when thou and thy friends at fierce noon-day
　　Are parched with heat, straight cast it in the air!Then Zephyr's cooling breath will round you play,
　　Distilling balm and flowers' sweet incense there;The tones of earthly woe will die away,
　　The grave become a bed of clouds so fair,To sing to rest life's billows will be seen,The day be lovely, and the night serene."--
　　Come, then, my friends! and whensoe'er ye find
　　Upon your way increase life's heavy load;If by fresh-waken'd blessings flowers are twin'd
　　Around your path, and golden fruits bestow'd,We'll seek the coming day with joyous mind!
　　Thus blest, we'll live, thus wander on our roadAnd when our grandsons sorrow o'er our tomb,Our love, to glad their bosoms, still shall bloom.
　　SONGS.-----Late resounds the early strain;Weal and woe in song remain.-----SOUND, SWEET SONG.
　　SOUND, sweet song, from some far land,Sighing softly close at hand,
　　Now of joy, and now of woe!
　　Stars are wont to glimmer so.
　　Sooner thus will good unfold;Children young and children oldGladly hear thy numbers flow.

　　No one talks more than a Poet;Fain he'd have the people know it.
　　Praise or blame he ever loves;None in prose confess an error,Yet we do so, void of terror,
　　In the Muses' silent groves.
　　What I err'd in, what corrected,What I suffer'd, what effected,
　　To this wreath as flow'rs belong;For the aged, and the youthful,And the vicious, and the truthful,
　　All are fair when viewed in song.
　　1800.*-----THE NEW AMADIS.
　　IN my boyhood's days so drear
　　I was kept confined;There I sat for many a year,
　　All alone I pined,As within the womb.
　　Yet thou drov'st away my gloom,
　　Golden phantasy!I became a hero true,
　　Like the Prince Pipi,And the world roam'd through,
　　Many a crystal palace built,
　　Crush'd them with like art,And the Dragon's life-blood spilt
　　With my glitt'ring dart.Yes! I was a man!
　　Next I formed the knightly plan
　　Princess Fish to free;She was much too complaisant,
　　Kindly welcomed me,--And I was gallant.
　　Heav'nly bread her kisses proved,
　　Glowing as the wine;Almost unto death I loved.
　　Sun-s appeared to shineIn her dazzling charms.
　　Who hath torn her from mine arms?
　　Could no magic bandMake her in her flight delay?
　　Say, where now her land?Where, alas, the way?
　　1775.*-----WHEN THE FOX DIES, HIS SKIN COUNTS.*
　　(* The name of a game, known in English as "Jack's alight.")
　　WE young people in the shade
　　Sat one sultry day;Cupid came, and "Dies the Fox"
　　With us sought to play.
　　Each one of my friends then sat
　　By his mistress dear;Cupid, blowing out the torch,
　　Said: "The taper's here!"
　　Then we quickly sent around
　　The expiring brand;Each one put it hastily
　　ln his neighbour's hand.
　　Dorilis then gave it me,
　　With a scoffing jest;Sudden into flame it broke,
　　By my fingers press'd.
　　And it singed my eyes and face,
　　Set my breast on fire;Then above my head the blaze
　　Mounted ever higher.
　　Vain I sought to put it out;
　　Ever burned the flame;Stead of dying, soon the Fox
　　Livelier still became.
　　1770.-----THE HEATHROSE.
　　ONCE a boy a Rosebud spied,
　　Heathrose fair and tender,All array'd in youthful pride,--Quickly to the spot he hied,
　　Ravished by her splendour.Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,
　　Heathrose fair and tender!
　　Said the boy, "I'll now pick thee,
　　Heathrose fair and tender!"Said the rosebud, "I'll prick thee,So that thou'lt remember me,
　　Ne'er will I surrender!"Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,
　　Heathrose fair and tender!
　　Now the cruel boy must pick
　　Heathrose fair and tender;Rosebud did her best to prick,--Vain 'twas 'gainst her fate to kick--
　　She must needs surrender.Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,
　　Heathrose fair and tender!
　　1779.*-----BLINDMAN'S BUFF.
　　OH, my Theresa dear!Thine eyes, I greatly fear,
　　Can through the bandage see!Although thine eyes are bound,By thee I'm quickly found,
　　And wherefore shouldst thou catch but me?
　　Ere long thou held'st me fast,With arms around me cast,
　　Upon thy breast I fell;Scarce was thy bandage gone,When all my joy was flown,
　　Thou coldly didst the blind repel.
　　He groped on ev'ry side,His limbs he sorely tried,
　　While scoffs arose all round;If thou no love wilt give,In sadness I shall live,
　　As if mine eyes remain'd still bound.
　　1770.-----CHRISTEL.
　　My senses ofttimes are oppress'd,
　　Oft stagnant is my blood;But when by Christel's sight I'm blest,
　　I feel my strength renew'd.I see her here, I see her there,
　　And really cannot tellThe manner how, the when, the where,
　　The why I love her well.
　　If with the merest glance I view
　　Her black and roguish eyes,And gaze on her black eyebrows too,
　　My spirit upward flies.Has any one a mouth so sweet,
　　Such love-round cheeks as she?Ah, when the eye her beauties meet,
　　It ne'er content can be.
　　And when in airy German dance
　　I clasp her form divine,So quick we whirl, so quick advance,
　　What rapture then like mine!And when she's giddy, and feels warm,
　　I cradle her, poor thing,Upon my breast, and in mine arm,--
　　I'm then a very king!
　　And when she looks with love on me,
　　Forgetting all but this,When press'd against my bosom, she
　　Exchanges kiss for kiss,All through my marrow runs a thrill,
　　Runs e'en my foot along!I feel so well, I feel so ill,
　　I feel so weak, so strong!
　　Would that such moments ne'er would end!
　　The day ne'er long I find;Could I the night too with her spend,
　　E'en that I should not mind.If she were in mine arms but held,
　　To quench love's thirst I'd try;And could my torments not be quell'd,
　　Upon her breast would die.
　　1776.*------THE COY ONE.
　　ONE Spring-morning bright and fair,
　　Roam'd a shepherdess and sang;Young and beauteous, free from care,
　　Through the fields her clear notes rang:So, Ia, Ia! le ralla, &c.
　　Of his lambs some two or three
　　Thyrsis offer'd for a kiss;First she eyed him roguishly,
　　Then for answer sang but this:So, Ia, Ia! le ralla, &c.
　　Ribbons did the next one offer,
　　And the third, his heart so trueBut, as with the lambs, the scoffer
　　Laugh'd at heart and ribbons too,--Still 'twas Ia! le ralla, &c.
　　1791.-----THE CONVERT.
　　As at sunset I was straying
　　Silently the wood along,Damon on his flute was playing,
　　And the rocks gave back the song,So la, Ia! &c.
　　Softly tow'rds him then he drew me;
　　Sweet each kiss he gave me then!And I said, "Play once more to me!"
　　And he kindly play'd again,So la, la! &c.
　　All my peace for aye has fleeted,
　　All my happiness has flown;Yet my ears are ever greeted
　　With that olden, blissful tone,So la, la! &c.
　　1791.-----PRESERVATION.
　　My maiden she proved false to me;
　　To hate all joys I soon began,
　　Then to a flowing stream I ran,--The stream ran past me hastily.
　　There stood I fix'd, in mute despair;
　　My head swam round as in a dream;
　　I well-nigh fell into the stream,And earth seem'd with me whirling there.
　　Sudden I heard a voice that cried--
　　I had just turn'd my face from thence--
　　It was a voice to charm each sense:"Beware, for deep is yonder tide!"
　　A thrill my blood pervaded now,
　　I look'd and saw a beauteous maid
　　I asked her name--twas Kate, she said--"Oh lovely Kate! how kind art thou!
　　"From death I have been sav'd by thee,
　　'Tis through thee only that I live;
　　Little 'twere life alone to give,My joy in life then deign to be!"
　　And then I told my sorrows o'er,
　　Her eyes to earth she sweetly threw;
　　I kiss'd her, and she kiss'd me too,And--then I talked of death no more.
　　1775.*-----THE MUSES' SON.
　　[Goethe quotes the beginning of this song in his Autobiography,as expressing the manner in which his poetical effusions used topour out from him.]
　　THROUGH field and wood to stray,And pipe my tuneful lay,--
　　'Tis thus my days are pass'd;And all keep tune with me,And move in harmony,
　　And so on, to the last.
　　To wait I scarce have powerThe garden's earliest flower,
　　The tree's first bloom in Spring;They hail my joyous strain,--When Winter comes again,
　　Of that sweet dream I sing.
　　My song sounds far and near,O'er ice it echoes clear,
　　Then Winter blossoms bright;And when his blossoms fly,Fresh raptures meet mine eye,
　　Upon the well-till'd height.
　　When 'neath the linden tree,Young folks I chance to see,
　　I set them moving soon;His nose the dull lad curls,The formal maiden whirls,
　　Obedient to my tune.
　　Wings to the feet ye lend,O'er hill and vale ye send
　　The lover far from home;When shall I, on your breast,.
　　Ye kindly muses, rest,And cease at length to roam?
　　1800.*------FOUND.
　　ONCE through the forest
　　Alone I went;To seek for nothing
　　My thoughts were bent.
　　I saw i' the shadow
　　A flower stand thereAs stars it glisten'd,
　　As eyes 'twas fair.
　　I sought to pluck it,--
　　It gently said:"Shall I be gather'd
　　Only to fade?"
　　With all its roots
　　I dug it with care,And took it home
　　To my garden fair.
　　In silent corner
　　Soon it was set;There grows it ever,
　　There blooms it yet.
　　1815.*-----LIKE AND LIKE.
　　A FAIR bell-flower
　　Sprang tip from the ground;And early its fragrance
　　It shed all around;A bee came thither
　　And sipp'd from its bell;That they for each other
　　Were made, we see well.
　　1814.-----RECIPROCAL INVITATION TO THE DANCE.
　　THE INDIFFERENT.
　　COME to the dance with me, come with me, fair one!
　　Dances a feast-day like this may well crown.If thou my sweetheart art not, thou canst be so,
　　But if thou wilt not, we still will dance on.Come to the dance with me, come with me, fair one!
　　Dances a feast-day like this may well crown.
　　THE TENDER.
　　Loved one, without thee, what then would all feast be?
　　Sweet one, without thee, what then were the dance?If thou my sweetheart wert not, I would dance not.
　　If thou art still so, all life is one feast.Loved one, without thee, what then would all feasts be?
　　Sweet one, without thee, what then were the dance?
　　THE INDIFFERENT.
　　Let them but love, then, and leave us the dancing!
　　Languishing love cannot bear the glad dance.Let us whirl round in the waltz's gay measure,
　　And let them steal to the dim-lighted wood.Let them but love, then, and leave us the dancing!
　　Languishing love cannot bear the glad dance.
　　THE TENDER.
　　Let them whirl round, then, and leave us to wander!
　　Wand'ring to love is a heavenly dance.Cupid, the near one, o'erhears their deriding,
　　Vengeance takes suddenly, vengeance takes soon.Let them whirl round, then, and leave us to wander!
　　Wand'ring to love is a heavenly dance.
　　1789.*-----SELF-DECEIT.
　　My neighbour's curtain, well I see,
　　Is moving to and fin.No doubt she's list'ning eagerly,
　　If I'm at home or no.
　　And if the jealous grudge I bore
　　And openly confess'd,Is nourish'd by me as before,
　　Within my inmost breast.
　　Alas! no fancies such as these
　　E'er cross'd the dear child's thoughts.I see 'tis but the ev'ning breeze
　　That with the curtain sports.
　　1803.-----DECLARATION OF WAR.
　　OH, would I resembled
　　The country girls fair,Who rosy-red ribbons
　　And yellow hats wear!
　　To believe I was pretty
　　I thought was allow'd;In the town I believed it
　　When by the youth vow'd.
　　Now that Spring hath return'd,
　　All my joys disappear;The girls of the country
　　Have lured him from here.
　　To change dress and figure,
　　Was needful I found,My bodice is longer,
　　My petticoat round.
　　My hat now is yellow.
　　My bodice like snow;The clover to sickle
　　With others I go.
　　Something pretty, e'er long
　　Midst the troop he explores;The eager boy signs me
　　To go within doors.
　　I bashfully go,--
　　Who I am, he can't trace;He pinches my cheeks,
　　And he looks in my face.
　　The town girl now threatens
　　You maidens with war;Her twofold charms pledges .
　　Of victory are.
　　1803.-----LOVER IN ALL SHAPES.
　　To be like a fish,Brisk and quick, is my wish;If thou cam'st with thy line.Thou wouldst soon make me thine.To be like a fish,Brisk and quick, is my wish.
　　Oh, were I a steed!Thou wouldst love me indeed.Oh, were I a carFit to bear thee afar!Oh, were I a steed!Thou wouldst love me indeed.
　　I would I were goldThat thy fingers might hold!If thou boughtest aught then,I'd return soon again.I would I were goldThat thy fingers might hold!
　　I would I were true,And my sweetheart still new!To be faithful I'd swear,And would go away ne'er.I would I were true,And my sweetheart still new!
　　I would I were old,And wrinkled and cold,So that if thou said'st No,I could stand such a blow!I would I were old,And wrinkled and cold.
　　An ape I would be,Full of mischievous glee;If aught came to vex thee,I'd plague and perplex thee.An ape I would be,Full of mischievous glee
　　As a lamb I'd behave,As a lion be brave,As a lynx clearly see,As a fox cunning be.As a lamb I'd behave,As a lion be brave.
　　Whatever I were,All on thee I'd confer;With the gifts of a princeMy affection evince.Whatever I were,All on thee I'd confer.
　　As nought diff'rent can make me,As I am thou must take me!If I'm not good enough,Thou must cut thine own stuff.As nought diff'rent can make me,As I am thou must take me!
　　1815.*-----THE GOLDSMITH'S APPRENTICE.
　　My neighbour, none can e'er deny,
　　Is a most beauteous maid;Her shop is ever in mine eye,
　　When working at my trade.
　　To ring and chain I hammer then
　　The wire of gold assay'd,And think the while: "For Kate, oh when
　　Will such a ring be made?"
　　And when she takes her shutters down,
　　Her shop at once invade,To buy and haggle, all the town,
　　For all that's there displayd.
　　I file, and maybe overfile
　　The wire of gold assay'd;My master grumbles all the while,--
　　Her shop the mischief made.
　　To ply her wheel she straight begins,
　　When not engaged in trade;I know full well for what she spins,--
　　'Tis hope guides that dear maid.
　　Her leg, while her small foot treads on,
　　Is in my mind portray'd;Her garter I recall anon,--
　　I gave it that dear maid.
　　Then to her lips the finest thread
　　Is by her hand convey'd.Were I there only in its stead,
　　How I would kiss the maid!
　　1808.-----ANSWERS IN A GAME OF QUESTIONS.
　　THE LADY.
　　IN the small and great world too,
　　What most charms a woman's heart?It is doubtless what is new,
　　For its blossoms joy impart;Nobler far is what is true,
　　For fresh blossoms it can shoot
　　Even in the time of fruit.
　　THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN.
　　With the Nymphs in wood and cave
　　Paris was acquainted well,Till Zeus sent, to make him rave,
　　Three of those in Heav'n who dwell;And the choice more trouble gave
　　Than e'er fell to mortal lot,
　　Whether in old times or not.
　　THE EXPERIENCED.
　　Tenderly a woman view,
　　And thoult win her, take my word;He who's quick and saucy too,
　　Will of all men be preferr'd;Who ne'er seems as if he knew
　　If he pleases, if he charms,--
　　He 'tis injures, he 'tis harms.
　　THE CONTENTED.
　　Manifold is human strife,
　　Human passion, human pain;Many a blessing yet is rife,
　　Many pleasures still remain.Yet the greatest bliss in life,
　　And the richest prize we find,
　　Is a good, contented mind.
　　THE MERRY COUNSEL.
　　He by whom man's foolish will
　　Is each day review'd and blamed,Who, when others fools are still,
　　Is himself a fool proclaim'd,--Ne'er at mill was beast's back press'd
　　With a heavier load than he.What I feel within my breast
　　That in truth's the thing for me!
　　1789.-----DIFFERENT EMOTIONS ON THE SAME SPOT.
　　THE MAIDEN.
　　I'VE seen him before me!What rapture steals o'er me!
　　Oh heavenly sight!He's coming to meet me;Perplex'd, I retreat me,
　　With shame take to flight.My mind seems to wander!Ye rocks and trees yonder,
　　Conceal ye my rapture.
　　Conceal my delight!
　　THE YOUTH.
　　'Tis here I must find her,'Twas here she enshrined her,
　　Here vanish'd from sight.She came, as to meet me,Then fearing to greet me,
　　With shame took to flight.Is't hope? Do I wander?Ye rocks and trees yonder,
　　Disclose ye the loved one,
　　Disclose my delight!
　　THE LANGUISHING.
　　O'er my sad, fate I sorrow,To each dewy morrow,
　　Veil'd here from man's sightBy the many mistaken,Unknown and forsaken,
　　Here I wing my flight!Compassionate spirit!Let none ever hear it,--
　　Conceal my affliction,
　　Conceal thy delight!
　　THE HUNTER.
　　To-day I'm rewarded;Rich booty's afforded
　　By Fortune so bright.My servant the pheasants,And hares fit for presents
　　Takes homeward at night;Here see I enrapturedIn nets the birds captured!--
　　Long life to the hunter!
　　Long live his delight!
　　1789.-----WHO'LL BUY GODS OF LOVE?
　　OF all the beauteous waresExposed for sale at fairs,None will give more delightThan those that to your sightFrom distant lands we bring.Oh, hark to what we sing!These beauteous birds behold,They're brought here to be sold.
　　And first the big one see,So full of roguish glee!With light and merry boundHe leaps upon the ground;Then springs up on the bougd,We will not praise him now.The merry bird behold,--He's brought here to be sold.
　　And now the small one see!A modest look has he,And yet he's such apotherAs his big roguish brother.'Tis chiefly when all's stillHe loves to show his will.The bird so small and bold,--He's brought here to be sold.
　　Observe this little love,This darling turtle dove!All maidens are so neat,So civil, so discreetLet them their charms set loose,And turn your love to use;The gentle bird behold,--She's brought here to be sold.
　　Their praises we won't tell;They'll stand inspection well.They're fond of what is new,--And yet, to show they're true,Nor seal nor letter's wanted;To all have wings been granted.The pretty birds behold,--Such beauties ne'er were sold!
　　1795.-----THE MISANTHROPE.
　　AT first awhile sits he,
　　With calm, unruffled brow;His features then I see,Distorted hideously,--
　　An owl's they might be now.
　　What is it, askest thou?Is't love, or is't ennui?
　　'Tis both at once, I vow.
　　1767-9.-----DIFFERENT THREATS.
　　I ONCE into a forest far
　　My maiden went to seek,And fell upon her neck, when: "Ah!"
　　She threaten'd, "I will shriek!"
　　Then cried I haughtily: "I'll crush
　　The man that dares come near thee!""Hush!" whisper'd she: "My loved one, hush!
　　Or else they'll overhear thee!"
　　1767-9.-----MAIDEN WISHES.
　　WHAT pleasure to meA bridegroom would be!When married we are,They call us mamma.No need then to sew,To school we ne'er go;Command uncontroll'd,Have maids, whom to scold;Choose clothes at our ease,Of what tradesmen we please;Walk freely about,And go to each rout,And unrestrained areBy papa or mamma.
　　1767-9.-----MOTIVES.
　　IF to a girl who loves us trulyHer mother gives instruction dulyIn virtue, duty, and what not,--And if she hearkens ne'er a jot,But with fresh-strengthen'd longing flies
　　To meet our kiss that seems to burn,--
　　Caprice has just as much concernedAs love in her bold enterprise.
　　But if her mother can succeedIn gaining for her maxims heed,And softening the girl's heart too,So that she coyly shuns our view,--The heart of youth she knows but ill;
　　For when a maiden is thus stern,
　　Virtue in truth has less concernIn this, than an inconstant will.
　　1767-9.-----TRUE ENJOYMENT.
　　VAINLY wouldst thou, to gain a heart,
　　Heap up a maiden's lap with gold;The joys of love thou must impart,
　　Wouldst thou e'er see those joys unfold.The voices of the throng gold buys,
　　No single heart 'twill win for thee;Wouldst thou a maiden make thy prize,
　　Thyself alone the bribe must be.
　　If by no sacred tie thou'rt bound,
　　Oh youth, thou must thyself restrain!Well may true liberty be found,
　　Tho' man may seem to wear a chain.Let one alone inflame thee e'er,
　　And if her heart with love o'erflows,Let tenderness unite you there,
　　If duty's self no fetter knows.
　　First feel, oh youth! A girl then find
　　Worthy thy choice,--let her choose thee,In body fair, and fair in mind,
　　And then thou wilt be blessed, like me.I who have made this art mine own,
　　A girl have chosen such as thisThe blessing of the priest alone
　　Is wanting to complete our bliss.
　　Nought but my rapture is her guide,
　　Only for me she cares to please,--Ne'er wanton save when by my side,
　　And modest when the world she sees;That time our glow may never chill,
　　She yields no right through frailty;Her favour is a favour still,
　　And I must ever grateful be.
　　Yet I'm content, and full of joy,
　　If she'll but grant her smile so sweet,Or if at table she'll employ,
　　To pillow hers, her lover's feet,Give me the apple that she bit,
　　The glass from which she drank, bestow,And when my kiss so orders it,
　　Her bosom, veil'd till then, will show.
　　And when she wills of love to speak,
　　In fond and silent hours of bliss,Words from her mouth are all I seek,
　　Nought else I crave,--not e'en a kiss.With what a soul her mind is fraught,
　　Wreath'd round with charms unceasingly!She's perfect,--and she fails in nought
　　Save in her deigning to love me.
　　My rev'rence throws me at her feet,
　　My longing throws me on her breast;This, youth, is rapture true and sweet,
　　Be wise, thus seeking to be blest.When death shall take thee from her side,
　　To join the angelic choir above,In heaven's bright mansions to abide,--No diff'rence at the change thoult prove.
　　1767-8.-----THE FAREWELL.
　　[Probably addressed to his mistress Frederica.]
　　LET mine eye the farewell say,
　　That my lips can utter ne'er;Fain I'd be a man to-day,
　　Yet 'tis hard, oh, hard to bear!
　　Mournful in an hour like this
　　Is love's sweetest pledge, I ween;Cold upon thy mouth the kiss,
　　Faint thy fingers' pressure e'en.
　　Oh what rapture to my heart
　　Used each stolen kiss to bring!As the violets joy impart,
　　Gather'd in the early spring.
　　Now no garlands I entwine,
　　Now no roses pluck. for thee,Though 'tis springtime, Fanny mine,
　　Dreary autumn 'tis to me!
　　1771.-----THE BEAUTIFUL NIGHT.
　　Now I leave this cottage lowly,
　　Where my love hath made her home,And with silent footstep slowly
　　Through the darksome forest roam,Luna breaks through oaks and bushes,
　　Zephyr hastes her steps to meet,And the waving birch-tree blushes,
　　Scattering round her incense sweet.
　　Grateful are the cooling breezes
　　Of this beauteous summer night,Here is felt the charm that pleases,
　　And that gives the soul delight.Boundless is my joy; yet, Heaven,
　　Willingly I'd leave to theeThousand such nights, were one given
　　By my maiden loved to me!
　　1767-8.-----HAPPINESS AND VISION.
　　TOGETHER at the altar weIn vision oft were seen by thee,
　　Thyself as bride, as bridegroom I.Oft from thy mouth full many a kissIn an unguarded hour of bliss
　　I then would steal, while none were by.
　　The purest rapture we then knew,The joy those happy hours gave too,
　　When tasted, fled, as time fleets on.What now avails my joy to me?Like dreams the warmest kisses flee,
　　Like kisses, soon all joys are gone.
　　1767-8.-----LIVING REMEMBRANCE.
　　HALF vex'd, half pleased, thy love will feel,Shouldst thou her knot or ribbon steal;To thee they're much--I won't conceal;
　　Such self-deceit may pardon'd be;A veil, a kerchief, garter, rings,In truth are no mean trifling things,
　　But still they're not enough for me.
　　She who is dearest to my heart,Gave me, with well dissembled smart,Of her own life, a living part,
　　No charm in aught beside I trace;How do I scorn thy paltry ware!A lock she gave me of the hair
　　That wantons o'er her beauteous face.
　　If, loved one, we must sever'd be,Wouldst thou not wholly fly from me,I still possess this legacy,
　　To look at, and to kiss in play.--My fate is to the hair's allied,We used to woo her with like pride,
　　And now we both are far away.
　　Her charms with equal joy we press'd,Her swelling cheeks anon caress'd,Lured onward by a yearning blest,
　　Upon her heaving bosom fell.Oh rival, free from envy's sway,Thou precious gift, thou beauteous prey.
　　Remain my joy and bliss to tell!
　　1767-9.-----THE BLISS OF ABSENCE.
　　DRINK, oh youth, joy's purest rayFrom thy loved one's eyes all day,
　　And her image paint at night!Better rule no lover knows,Yet true rapture greater grows,
　　When far sever'd from her sight.
　　Powers eternal, distance, time,Like the might of stars sublime,
　　Gently rock the blood to rest,O'er my senses softness steals,Yet my bosom lighter feels,
　　And I daily am more blest.
　　Though I can forget her ne'er,Yet my mind is free from care,
　　I can calmly live and move;Unperceived infatuationLonging turns to adoration,
　　Turns to reverence my love.
　　Ne'er can cloud, however light,Float in ether's regions bright,
　　When drawn upwards by the sun,As my heart in rapturous calm.Free from envy and alarm,
　　Ever love I her alone!
　　1767-9.-----TO LUNA.
　　SISTER of the first-born light,
　　Type of sorrowing gentleness!
　　Quivering mists in silv'ry dressFloat around thy features bright;When thy gentle foot is heard,
　　From the day-closed caverns then
　　Wake the mournful ghosts of men,I, too, wake, and each night-bird.
　　O'er a field of boundless span
　　Looks thy gaze both far and wide.
　　Raise me upwards to thy side!Grant this to a raving man!And to heights of rapture raised,
　　Let the knight so crafty peep
　　At his maiden while asleep,Through her lattice-window glazed.
　　Soon the bliss of this sweet view,
　　Pangs by distance caused allays;
　　And I gather all thy rays,And my look I sharpen too.Round her unveil'd limbs I see
　　Brighter still become the glow,
　　And she draws me down below,As Endymion once drew thee.
　　1767-9.-----THE WEDDING NIGHT.
　　WITHIN the chamber, far away
　　From the glad feast, sits Love in dreadLest guests disturb, in wanton play,
　　The silence of the bridal bed.His torch's pale flame serves to gild
　　The scene with mystic sacred glow;The room with incense-clouds is fil'd,
　　That ye may perfect rapture know.
　　How beats thy heart, when thou dost hear
　　The chime that warns thy guests to fly!How glow'st thou for those lips so dear,
　　That soon are mute, and nought deny!With her into the holy place
　　Thou hast'nest then, to perfect all;The fire the warder's hands embrace,
　　Grows, like a night-light, dim and small.
　　How heaves her bosom, and how burns
　　Her face at every fervent kiss!Her coldness now to trembling turns,
　　Thy daring now a duty is.Love helps thee to undress her fast,
　　But thou art twice as fast as he;And then he shuts both eye at last,
　　With sly and roguish modesty.
　　1767.-----MISCHIEVOUS JOY.
　　AS a butterfly renew'd,
　　When in life I breath'd my last,
　　To the spots my flight I wing,
　　Scenes of heav'nly rapture past,
　　Over meadows, to the spring,Round the hill, and through the wood.
　　Soon a tender pair I spy,
　　And I look down from my seat
　　On the beauteous maiden's head--
　　When embodied there I meet
　　All I lost as soon as dead,Happy as before am I.
　　Him she clasps with silent smile,
　　And his mouth the hour improves,
　　Sent by kindly Deities;
　　First from breast to mouth it roves,
　　Then from mouth to hands it flies,And I round him sport the while.
　　And she sees me hov'ring near;
　　Trembling at her lovers rapture,
　　Up she springs--I fly away,
　　"Dearest! let's the insect capture
　　Come! I long to make my preyYonder pretty little dear!"
　　1767-9.-----APPARENT DEATH.
　　WEEP, maiden, weep here o'er the tomb of Love;
　　He died of nothing--by mere chance was slain.But is he really dead?--oh, that I cannot prove:
　　A nothing, a mere chance, oft gives him life again.
　　1767-9.-----NOVEMBER SONG.
　　To the great archer--not to him
　　To meet whom flies the sun,And who is wont his features dim
　　With clouds to overrun--
　　But to the boy be vow'd these rhymes,
　　Who 'mongst the roses plays,Who hear us, and at proper times
　　To pierce fair hearts essays.
　　Through him the gloomy winter night,
　　Of yore so cold and drear,Brings many a loved friend to our sight,
　　And many a woman dear.
　　Henceforward shall his image fair
　　Stand in yon starry skies,And, ever mild and gracious there,
　　Alternate set and rise.
　　1815.*-----TO THE CHOSEN ONE.[This sweet song is doubtless one of those addressed toFrederica.]
　　HAND in hand! and lip to lip!
　　Oh, be faithful, maiden dear!Fare thee well! thy lover's ship
　　Past full many a rock must steersBut should he the haven see,
　　When the storm has ceased to break,And be happy, reft of thee,--
　　May the Gods fierce vengeance take!
　　Boldly dared is well nigh won!
　　Half my task is solved aright;Ev'ry star's to me a sun,
　　Only cowards deem it night.Stood I idly by thy side,
　　Sorrow still would sadden me;But when seas our paths divide,
　　Gladly toil I,--toil for thee!
　　Now the valley I perceive,
　　Where together we will go,And the streamlet watch each eve,
　　Gliding peacefully belowOh, the poplars on yon spot!
　　Oh, the beech trees in yon grove!And behind we'll build a cot,
　　Where to taste the joys of love!
　　1771.-----FIRST LOSS.
　　AH! who'll e'er those days restore,
　　Those bright days of early loveWho'll one hour again concede,
　　Of that time so fondly cherish'd!Silently my wounds I feed,And with wailing evermore
　　Sorrow o'er each joy now perish'd.Ah! who'll e'er the days restore
　　Of that time so fondly cherish'd.
　　1789.*-----AFTER-SENSATIONS.
　　WHEN the vine again is blowing,
　　Then the wine moves in the cask;When the rose again is glowing,
　　Wherefore should I feel oppress'd?
　　Down my cheeks run tears all-burning,
　　If I do, or leave my task;I but feel a speechless yearning,
　　That pervades my inmost breast.
　　But at length I see the reason,
　　When the question I would ask:'Twas in such a beauteous season,
　　Doris glowed to make me blest!
　　1797.-----PROXIMITY OF THE BELOVED ONE.
　　I THINK of thee, whene'er the sun his beams
　　O'er ocean flings;I think  of thee, whene'er the moonlight gleams
　　In silv'ry springs.
　　I see thee, when upon the distant ridge
　　The dust awakes;At midnight's hour, when on the fragile bridge
　　The wanderer quakes.
　　I hear thee, when yon billows rise on high,
　　With murmur deep.To tread the silent grove oft wander I,
　　When all's asleep.
　　I'm near thee, though thou far away mayst be--
　　Thou, too, art near!The sun then sets, the stars soon lighten me.
　　Would thou wert here!
　　1795.-----PRESENCE.
　　ALL things give token of thee!As soon as the bright sun is shining,Thou too wilt follow, I trust.
　　When in the garden thou walk'st,Thou then art the rose of all roses,Lily of lilies as well.
　　When thou dost move in the dance,Then each constellation moves also;With thee and round thee they move.
　　Night! oh, what bliss were the night!For then thou o'ershadow'st the lustre,Dazzling and fair, of the moon.
　　Dazzling and beauteous art thou,And flowers, and moon, and the planetsHomage pay, Sun, but to thee.
　　Sun! to me also be thouCreator of days bright and glorious;Life and Eternity this!
　　1813.-----TO THE DISTANT ONE.
　　AND have I lost thee evermore?
　　Hast thou, oh fair one, from me flown?Still in mine ear sounds, as of yore,
　　Thine ev'ry word, thine ev'ry tone.
　　As when at morn the wand'rer's eye
　　Attempts to pierce the air in vain,When, hidden in the azure sky,
　　The lark high o'er him chaunts his strain:
　　So do I cast my troubled gaze
　　Through bush, through forest, o'er the lea;Thou art invoked by all my lays;
　　Oh, come then, loved one, back to me!
　　1789.*-----BY THE RIVER.
　　FLOW on, ye lays so loved, so fair,
　　On to Oblivion's ocean flow!May no rapt boy recall you e'er,
　　No maiden in her beauty's glow!
　　My love alone was then your theme,
　　But now she scorns my passion true.Ye were but written in the stream;
　　As it flows on, then, flow ye too!
　　1798.*-----FAREWELL.
　　To break one's word is pleasure-fraught,
　　To do one's duty gives a smart;While man, alas! will promise nought,
　　That is repugnant to his heart.
　　Using some magic strains of yore,
　　Thou lurest him, when scarcely calm,On to sweet folly's fragile bark once more,
　　Renewing, doubling chance of harm.
　　Why seek to hide thyself from me?
　　Fly not my sight--be open then!Known late or early it must be,
　　And here thou hast thy word again.
　　My duty is fulfill'd to-day,
　　No longer will I guard thee from surprise;But, oh, forgive the friend who from thee turns away,
　　And to himself for refuge flies!
　　1797.-----THE EXCHANGE.
　　THE stones in the streamlet I make my bright pillow,And open my arms to the swift-rolling billow,
　　That lovingly hastens to fall on my breast.Then fickleness soon bids it onwards be flowing;A second draws nigh, its caresses bestowing,--
　　And so by a twofold enjoyment I'm blest.
　　And yet thou art trailing in sorrow and sadnessThe moments that life, as it flies, gave for gladness,
　　Because by thy love thou'rt remember'd no more!Oh, call back to mind former days and their blisses!The lips of the second will give as sweet kisses
　　As any the lips of the first gave before!
　　1767-9.-----WELCOME AND FAREWELL.
　　[Another of the love-songs addressed to Frederica.]
　　QUICK throbb'd my heart: to norse! haste, haste,
　　And lo! 'twas done with speed of light;The evening soon the world embraced,
　　And o'er the mountains hung the night.Soon stood, in robe of mist, the oak,
　　A tow'ring giant in his size,Where darkness through the thicket broke,
　　And glared with hundred gloomy eyes.
　　From out a hill of clouds the moon
　　With mournful gaze began to peer:The winds their soft wings flutter'd soon,
　　And murmur'd in mine awe-struck ear;The night a thousand monsters made,
　　Yet fresh and joyous was my mind;What fire within my veins then play'd!
　　What glow was in my bosom shrin'd!
　　I saw thee, and with tender pride
　　Felt thy sweet gaze pour joy on me;While all my heart was at thy side.
　　And every breath I breath'd for thee.The roseate hues that spring supplies
　　Were playing round thy features fair,And love for me--ye Deities!
　　I hoped it, I deserved it ne'er!
　　But, when the morning sun return'd,
　　Departure filled with grief my heart:Within thy kiss, what rapture burn'd!
　　But in thy look, what bitter smart!I went--thy gaze to earth first roved
　　Thou follow'dst me with tearful eye:And yet, what rapture to be loved!
　　And, Gods, to love--what ecstasy!
　　1771.-----NEW LOVE, NEW LIFE.
　　[Written at the time of Goethe's connection with Lily.]
　　HEART! my heart! what means this feeling?
　　What oppresseth thee so sore?What strange life is o'er me stealing!
　　I acknowledge thee no more.Fled is all that gave thee gladness,Fled the cause of all thy sadness,
　　Fled thy peace, thine industry--
　　Ah, why suffer it to be?
　　Say, do beauty's graces youthful,
　　Does this form so fair and bright,Does this gaze, so kind, so truthful,
　　Chain thee with unceasing might?Would I tear me from her boldly,Courage take, and fly her coldly,
　　Back to her. I'm forthwith led
　　By the path I seek to tread.
　　By a thread I ne'er can sever,
　　For 'tis 'twined with magic skill,Doth the cruel maid for ever
　　Hold me fast against my will.While those magic chains confine me,To her will I must resign me.
　　Ah, the change in truth is great!
　　Love! kind love! release me straight!
　　1775.-----TO BELINDA.
　　[This song was also written for Lily. Goethe mentions, at the endof his Autobiography, that he overheard her singing it oneevening after he had taken his last farewell of her.]
　　WHEREFORE drag me to yon glittering eddy,
　　With resistless might?Was I, then, not truly blest already
　　In the silent night?
　　In my secret chamber refuge taking,
　　'Neath the moon's soft ray,And her awful light around me breaking,
　　Musing there I lay.
　　And I dream'd of hours with joy o'erflowing,
　　Golden, truly blest,While thine image so beloved was glowing
　　Deep within my breast.
　　Now to the card-table hast thou bound me,
　　'Midst the torches glare?Whilst unhappy faces are around me,
　　Dost thou hold me there?
　　Spring-flow'rs are to me more rapture-giving,
　　Now conceal'd from view;Where thou, angel, art, is Nature living,
　　Love and kindness too.
　　1775.-----MAY SONG.
　　How fair doth Nature
　　Appear again!How bright the sunbeams!
　　How smiles the plain!
　　The flow'rs are bursting
　　From ev'ry bough,And thousand voices
　　Each bush yields now.
　　And joy and gladness
　　Fill ev'ry breast!Oh earth!--oh sunlight!
　　Oh rapture blest!
　　Oh love! oh loved one!
　　As golden bright,As clouds of morning
　　On yonder height!
　　Thou blessest gladly
　　The smiling field,--The world in fragrant
　　Vapour conceal'd.
　　Oh maiden, maiden,
　　How love I thee!Thine eye, how gleams it!
　　How lov'st thou me!
　　The blithe lark loveth
　　Sweet song and air,The morning flow'ret
　　Heav'n's incense fair,
　　As I now love thee
　　With fond desire,For thou dost give me
　　Youth, joy, and fire,
　　For new-born dances
　　And minstrelsy.Be ever happy,
　　As thou lov'st me!
　　1775.*-----WITH A PAINTED RIBBON.
　　LITTLE leaves and flow'rets too,
　　Scatter we with gentle hand,Kind young spring-gods to the view,
　　Sporting on an airy band.
　　Zephyr, bear it on the wing,
　　Twine it round my loved one's dress;To her glass then let her spring,
　　Full of eager joyousness.
　　Roses round her let her see,
　　She herself a youthful rose.Grant, dear life, one look to me!
　　'Twill repay me all my woes,
　　What this bosom feels, feel thou.
　　Freely offer me thy hand;Let the band that joins us now
　　Be no fragile rosy band!
　　1770.-----WITH A GOLDEN NECKLACE.
　　THIS page a chain to bring thee burns,
　　That, train'd to suppleness of old,On thy fair neck to nestle, yearns,
　　In many a hundred little fold.
　　To please the silly thing consent!
　　'Tis harmless, and from boldness free;By day a trifling ornament,
　　At night 'tis cast aside by thee.
　　But if the chain they bring thee ever,
　　Heavier, more fraught with weal or woe,I'd then, Lisette, reproach thee never
　　If thou shouldst greater scruples show.
　　1775.*-----ON THE LAKE,
　　[Written on the occasion of Goethe's starting with his friendPassavant on a Swiss Tour.]
　　I DRINK fresh nourishment, new blood
　　From out this world more free;The Nature is so kind and good
　　That to her breast clasps me!The billows toss our bark on high,
　　And with our oars keep time,While cloudy mountains tow'rd the sky
　　Before our progress climb.
　　Say, mine eye, why sink'st thou down?Golden visions, are ye flown?
　　Hence, thou dream, tho' golden-twin'd;
　　Here, too, love and life I find.
　　Over the waters are blinking
　　Many a thousand fair star;Gentle mists are drinking
　　Round the horizon afar.Round the shady creek lightly
　　Morning zephyrs awake,And the ripen'd fruit brightly
　　Mirrors itself in the lake.
　　1775.-----FROM THE MOUNTAIN.
　　[Written just after the preceding one, on a mountain overlookingthe Lake of Zurich.]
　　IF I, dearest Lily, did not love thee,
　　How this prospect would enchant my sight!And yet if I, Lily, did not love thee,
　　Could I find, or here, or there, delight?
　　1775.-----FLOWER-SALUTE.
　　THIS nosegay,--'twas I dress'd it,--
　　Greets thee a thousand times!Oft stoop'd I, and caress'd it,
　　Ah! full a thousand times,And 'gainst my bosom press'd it
　　A hundred thousand times!
　　1815.*-----IN SUMMER.
　　How plain and heightWith dewdrops are bright!How pearls have crown'dThe plants all around!How sighs the breezeThro' thicket and trees!How loudly in the sun's clear raysThe sweet birds carol forth their lays!
　　But, ah! above,Where saw I my love,Within her room,Small, mantled in gloom,Enclosed around,Where sunlight was drown'd,How little there was earth to me,With all its beauteous majesty!
　　1776.*-----MAY SONG.
　　BETWEEN wheatfield and corn,Between hedgerow and thorn,Between pasture and tree,Where's my sweetheartTell it me!
　　Sweetheart caught I
　　Not at home;She's then, thought I.
　　Gone to roam.Fair and loving
　　Blooms sweet May;Sweetheart's roving,
　　Free and gay.
　　By the rock near the wave,Where her first kiss she gave,On the greensward, to me,--Something I see!Is it she?
　　1812.-----PREMATURE SPRING.
　　DAYS full of rapture,
　　Are ye renew'd ?--Smile in the sunlight
　　Mountain and wood?
　　Streams richer laden
　　Flow through the dale,Are these the meadows?
　　Is this the vale?
　　Coolness cerulean!
　　Heaven and height!Fish crowd the ocean,
　　Golden and bright.
　　Birds of gay plumage
　　Sport in the grove,Heavenly numbers
　　Singing above.
　　Under the verdure's
　　Vigorous bloom,Bees, softly bumming,
　　Juices consume.
　　Gentle disturbance
　　Quivers in air,Sleep-causing fragrance,
　　Motion so fair.
　　Soon with more power
　　Rises the breeze,Then in a moment
　　Dies in the trees.
　　But to the bosom
　　Comes it again.Aid me, ye Muses,
　　Bliss to sustain!
　　Say what has happen'd
　　Since yester e'en?Oh, ye fair sisters,
　　Her I have seen!
　　1802.-----AUTUMN FEELINGS.
　　FLOURISH greener, as ye clamber,Oh ye leaves, to seek my chamber,
　　Up the trellis'd vine on high!May ye swell, twin-berries tender,Juicier far,--and with more splendour
　　Ripen, and more speedily!O'er ye broods the sun at evenAs he sinks to rest, and heaven
　　Softly breathes into your earAll its fertilising fullness,While the moon's refreshing coolness,
　　Magic-laden, hovers near;And, alas! ye're watered ever
　　By a stream of tears that rillFrom mine eyes--tears ceasing never,
　　Tears of love that nought can still!
　　1775.*-----RESTLESS LOVE.
　　THROUGH rain, through snow,Through tempest go!'Mongst streaming caves,O'er misty waves,On, on! still on!Peace, rest have flown!
　　Sooner through sadness
　　I'd wish to be slain,Than all the gladness
　　Of life to sustainAll the fond yearning
　　That heart feels for heart,Only seems burning
　　To make them both smart.
　　How shall I fly?Forestwards hie?Vain were all strife!Bright crown of life.Turbulent bliss,--Love, thou art this!
　　1789.-----THE SHEPHERD'S LAMENT.
　　ON yonder lofty mountain
　　A thousand times I stand,And on my staff reclining,
　　Look down on the smiling land.
　　My grazing flocks then I follow,
　　My dog protecting them well;I find myself in the valley,
　　But how, I scarcely can tell.
　　The whole of the meadow is cover'd
　　With flowers of beauty rare;I pluck them, but pluck them unknowing
　　To whom the offering to bear.
　　In rain and storm and tempest,
　　I tarry beneath the tree,But closed remaineth yon portal;
　　'Tis all but a vision to me.
　　High over yonder dwelling,
　　There rises a rainbow gay;But she from home hath departed
　　And wander'd far, far away.
　　Yes, far away bath she wander'd,
　　Perchance e'en over the sea;Move onward, ye sheep, then, move onward!
　　Full sad the shepherd must be.
　　1803.*-----COMFORT IN TEARS.
　　How happens it that thou art sad,
　　While happy all appear?Thine eye proclaims too well that thou
　　Hast wept full many a tear.
　　"If I have wept in solitude,
　　None other shares my grief,And tears to me sweet balsam are,
　　And give my heart relief."
　　Thy happy friends invite thee now,--
　　Oh come, then, to our breast!And let the loss thou hast sustain'd
　　Be there to us confess'd!
　　"Ye shout, torment me, knowing not
　　What 'tis afflicteth me;Ah no! I have sustained no loss,
　　Whate'er may wanting be."
　　If so it is, arise in haste!
　　Thou'rt young and full of life.At years like thine, man's blest with strength.
　　And courage for the strife.
　　"Ah no! in vain 'twould be to strive,
　　The thing I seek is far;It dwells as high, it gleams as fair
　　As yonder glitt'ring star."
　　The stars we never long to clasp,
　　We revel in their light,And with enchantment upward gaze,
　　Each clear and radiant night.
　　"And I with rapture upward gaze,
　　On many a blissful day;Then let me pass the night in tears,
　　Till tears are wip'd away!
　　1803.*-----NIGHT SONG,
　　WHEN on thy pillow lying,
　　Half listen, I implore,And at my lute's soft sighing,
　　Sleep on! what wouldst thou more?
　　For at my lute's soft sighing
　　The stars their blessings pourOn feelings never-dying;
　　Sleep on! what wouldst thou more?
　　Those feelings never-dying
　　My spirit aid to soarFrom earthly conflicts trying;
　　Sleep on! what wouldst thou more?
　　From earthly conflicts trying
　　Thou driv'st me to this shore;Through thee I'm thither flying,--
　　Sleep on! what wouldst thou more?
　　Through thee I'm hither flying,
　　Thou wilt not list beforeIn slumbers thou art lying:
　　Sleep on! what wouldst thou more?
　　1803.*-----LONGING.
　　WHAT pulls at my heart so?
　　What tells me to roam?What drags me and lures me
　　From chamber and home?How round the cliffs gather
　　The clouds high in air!I fain would go thither,
　　I fain would be there!
　　The sociable flight
　　Of the ravens comes back;I mingle amongst them,
　　And follow their track.Round wall and round mountain
　　Together we fly;She tarries below there,
　　I after her spy.
　　Then onward she wanders,
　　My flight I wing soonTo the wood fill'd with bushes,
　　A bird of sweet tune.She tarries and hearkens,
　　And smiling, thinks she:"How sweetly he's singing!
　　He's singing to me!"
　　The heights are illum'd
　　By the fast setting sun;The pensive fair maiden
　　Looks thoughtfully on;She roams by the streamlet,
　　O'er meadows she goes,And darker and darker
　　The pathway fast grows.
　　I rise on a sudden,
　　A glimmering star;"What glitters above me,
　　So near and so far?"
　　And when thou with wonder
　　Hast gazed on the light,I fall down before thee,
　　Entranced by thy sight!
　　1803.-----TO MIGNON.
　　OVER vale and torrent farRolls along the sun's bright car.Ah! he wakens in his course
　　Mine, as thy deep-seated smart
　　In the heart.Ev'ry morning with new force.
　　Scarce avails night aught to me;E'en the visions that I seeCome but in a mournful guise;
　　And I feel this silent smart
　　In my heartWith creative pow'r arise.
　　During many a beauteous yearI have seen ships 'neath me steer,As they seek the shelt'ring bay;
　　But, alas, each lasting smart
　　In my heartFloats not with the stream away.
　　I must wear a gala dress,Long stored up within my press,For to-day to feasts is given;
　　None know with what bitter smart
　　Is my heartFearfully and madly riven.
　　Secretly I weep each tear,Yet can cheerful e'en appear,With a face of healthy red;
　　For if deadly were this silent smart
　　In my heart,Ah, I then had long been dead!-----THE MOUNTAIN CASTLE.
　　THERE stands on yonder high mountain
　　A castle built of yore,Where once lurked horse and horseman
　　In rear of gate and of door.
　　Now door and gate are in ashes,
　　And all around is so still;And over the fallen ruins
　　I clamber just as I will.
　　Below once lay a cellar,
　　With costly wines well stor'd;No more the glad maid with her pitcher
　　Descends there to draw from the hoard.
　　No longer the goblet she places
　　Before the guests at the feast;The flask at the meal so hallow'd
　　No longer she fills for the priest.
　　No more for the eager squire
　　The draught in the passage is pour'd;No more for the flying present
　　Receives she the flying reward.
　　For all the roof and the rafters,
　　They all long since have been burn'd,And stairs and passage and chapel
　　To rubbish and ruins are turn'd.
　　Yet when with lute and with flagon,
　　When day was smiling and bright,I've watch'd my mistress climbing
　　To gain this perilous height,
　　Then rapture joyous and radiant
　　The silence so desolate brake,And all, as in days long vanish'd,
　　Once more to enjoyment awoke;
　　As if for guests of high station
　　The largest rooms were prepared;As if from those times so precious
　　A couple thither had fared;
　　As if there stood in his chapel
　　The priest in his sacred dress,And ask'd: "Would ye twain be united?"
　　And we, with a smile, answer'd, "Yes!"
　　And songs that breath'd a deep feeling,
　　That touched the heart's innermost chord,The music-fraught mouth of sweet echo,
　　Instead of the many, outpour'd.
　　And when at eve all was hidden
　　In silence unbroken and deep,The glowing sun then look'd upwards,
　　And gazed on the summit so steep.
　　And squire and maiden then glitter'd
　　As bright and gay as a lord,She seized the time for her present,
　　And he to give her reward.
　　1803.*-----THE SPIRIT'S SALUTE.
　　THE hero's noble shade stands high
　　On yonder turret grey;And as the ship is sailing by,
　　He speeds it on his way.
　　"See with what strength these sinews thrill'd!
　　This heart, how firm and wild!These bones, what knightly marrow fill'd!
　　This cup, how bright it smil'd!
　　"Half of my life I strove and fought,
　　And half I calmly pass'd;And thou, oh ship with beings fraught,
　　Sail safely to the last!"
　　1774.-----TO A GOLDEN HEART THAT HE WORE ROUND HIS NECK.
　　[Addressed, during the Swiss tour already mentioned, to a presentLily had given him, during the time of their happy connection,which was then about to be terminated for ever.]
　　OH thou token loved of joys now perish'd
　　That I still wear from my neck suspended,Art thou stronger than our spirit-bond so cherish'd?
　　Or canst thou prolong love's days untimely ended?
　　Lily, I fly from thee! I still am doom'd to rangeThro' countries strange,
　　Thro' distant vales and woods, link'd on to thee!Ah, Lily's heart could surely never fall
　　So soon away from me!
　　As when a bird bath broken from his thrall,
　　And seeks the forest green,Proof of imprisonment he bears behind him,A morsel of the thread once used to bind him;
　　The free-born bird of old no more is seen,
　　For he another's prey bath been.
　　1775.-----THE BLISS OF SORROW.
　　NEVER dry, never dry,
　　Tears that eternal love sheddeth!How dreary, how dead doth the world still appear,When only half-dried on the eye is the tear!
　　Never dry, never dry,
　　Tears that unhappy love sheddeth!
　　1789.*-----THE WANDERER'S NIGHT-SONG.
　　THOU who comest from on high,
　　Who all woes and sorrows stillest,Who, for twofold misery,
　　Hearts with twofold balsam fillest,Would this constant strife would cease!
　　What are pain and rapture now?Blissful Peace,
　　To my bosom hasten thou!
　　1789.*-----THE SAME.
　　[Written at night on the Kickelhahn, a hill in the forest ofIlmenau, on the walls of a little hermitage where Goethe composedthe last act of his Iphigenia.]
　　HUSH'D on the hill
　　Is the breeze;
　　Scarce by the zephyr
　　The trees
　　Softly are press'd;The woodbird's asleep on the bough.Wait, then, and thou
　　Soon wilt find rest.
　　1783.-----THE HUNTER'S EVEN-SONG.
　　THE plain with still and wand'ring feet,
　　And gun full-charged, I tread,And hov'ring see thine image sweet,
　　Thine image dear, o'er head.
　　In gentle silence thou dost fare
　　Through field and valley dear;But doth my fleeting image ne'er
　　To thy mind's eye appear?
　　His image, who, by grief oppress'd,
　　Roams through the world forlorn,And wanders on from east to west,
　　Because from thee he's torn?
　　When I would think of none but thee,
　　Mine eyes the moon survey;A calm repose then steals o'er me,
　　But how, 'twere hard to say.
　　1776,*-----TO THE MOON.
　　BUSH and vale thou fill'st again
　　With thy misty ray,And my spirit's heavy chain
　　Castest far away.
　　Thou dost o'er my fields extend
　　Thy sweet soothing eye,Watching like a gentle friend,
　　O'er my destiny.
　　Vanish'd days of bliss and woe
　　Haunt me with their tone,Joy and grief in turns I know,
　　As I stray alone.
　　Stream beloved, flow on! flow on!
　　Ne'er can I be gay!Thus have sport and kisses gone,
　　Truth thus pass'd away.
　　Once I seem'd the lord to be
　　Of that prize so fair!Now, to our deep sorrow, we
　　Can forget it ne'er.
　　Murmur, stream, the vale along,
　　Never cease thy sighs;Murmur, whisper to my song
　　Answering melodies!
　　When thou in the winter's night
　　Overflow'st in wrath,Or in spring-time sparklest bright,
　　As the buds shoot forth.
　　He who from the world retires,
　　Void of hate, is blest;Who a friend's true love inspires,
　　Leaning on his breast!
　　That which heedless man ne'er knew,
　　Or ne'er thought aright,Roams the bosom's labyrinth through,
　　Boldly into night.
　　1789.*-----TO LINA.
　　SHOULD these songs, love, as they fleet,
　　Chance again to reach thy hand,At the piano take thy seat,
　　Where thy friend was wont to stand!
　　Sweep with finger bold the string,
　　Then the book one moment see:But read not! do nought but sing!
　　And each page thine own will be!
　　Ah, what grief the song imparts
　　With its letters, black on white,That, when breath'd by thee, our hearts
　　Now can break and now delight!
　　1800.*-----EVER AND EVERYWHERE.
　　FAR explore the mountain hollow,High in air the clouds then follow!
　　To each brook and vale the Muse
　　Thousand times her call renews.
　　Soon as a flow'ret blooms in spring,It wakens many a strain;
　　And when Time spreads his fleeting wing,
　　The seasons come again.
　　1820.*-----PETITION.
　　OH thou sweet maiden fair,Thou with the raven hair,
　　Why to the window go?
　　While gazing down below,Art standing vainly there?
　　Oh, if thou stood'st for me,And lett'st the latch but fly,
　　How happy should I be!How soon would I leap high!
　　1789.*-----TO HIS COY ONE.
　　SEEST thou yon smiling Orange?Upon the tree still hangs it;Already March bath vanish'd,And new-born flow'rs are shooting.I draw nigh to the tree then,And there I say: Oh Orange,Thou ripe and juicy Orange,Thou sweet and luscious Orange,I shake the tree, I shake it,Oh fall into my lap!
　　1789.*-----NIGHT THOUGHTS.
　　OH, unhappy stars! your fate I mourn,
　　Ye by whom the sea-toss'd sailor's lighted,Who with radiant beams the heav'ns adorn,
　　But by gods and men are unrequited:For ye love not,--ne'er have learnt to love!Ceaselessly in endless dance ye move,In the spacious sky your charms displaying,
　　What far travels ye have hasten'd through,Since, within my loved one's arms delaying,
　　I've forgotten you and midnight too!
　　1789.*-----TO LIDA.
　　THE only one whom, Lida, thou canst love,
　　Thou claim'st, and rightly claim'st, for only thee;He too is wholly thine; since doomed to rove
　　Far from thee, in life's turmoils nought I seeSave a thin veil, through which thy form I view,As though in clouds; with kindly smile and true,
　　It cheers me, like the stars eterne that gleamAcross the northern-lights' far-flick'ring beam.
　　1789.*-----PROXIMITY.
　　I KNOW not, wherefore, dearest love,
　　Thou often art so strange and coyWhen 'mongst man's busy haunts we move,
　　Thy coldness puts to flight my joy.But soon as night and silence round us reign,I know thee by thy kisses sweet again!
　　1789.*-----RECIPROCAL.
　　MY mistress, where sits she?
　　What is it that charms?The absent she's rocking,
　　Held fast in her arms.
　　In pretty cage prison'd
　　She holds a bird still;Yet lets him fly from her,
　　Whenever he will.
　　He pecks at her finger,
　　And pecks at her lips,And hovers and flutters,
　　And round her he skips.
　　Then hasten thou homeward,
　　In fashion to be;If thou hast the maiden,
　　She also hath thee.
　　1816.-----ROLLICKING HANS.
　　HALLO there! A glass!
　　Ha! the draught's truly sweet!If for drink go my shoes,
　　I shall still have my feet.
　　A maiden and wine,
　　With sweet music and song,--I would they were mine,
　　All life's journey along!
　　If I depart from this sad sphere,And leave a will behind me here,A suit at law will be preferr'd,But as for thanks,--the deuce a word!So ere I die, I squander all,And that a proper will I call.
　　HIS COMRADE.
　　Hallo there! A glass!
　　Ha! the draught's truly sweetIf thou keepest thy shoes,
　　Thou wilt then spare thy feet.
　　A maiden and wine,
　　With sweet music and song,On pavement, are thine,
　　All life's journey along!-----THE FREEBOOTER,
　　No door has my house,
　　No house has my door;And in and out ever
　　I carry my store.
　　No grate has my kitchen,
　　No kitchen my grate;Yet roasts it and boils it
　　Both early and late.
　　My bed has no trestles,
　　My trestles no bed;Yet merrier moments
　　No mortal e'er led.
　　My cellar is lofty,
　　My barn is full deep,From top to the bottom,--
　　There lie I and sleep.
　　And soon as I waken,
　　All moves on its race;My place has no fixture,
　　My fixture no place.
　　1827.*-----JOY AND SORROW.
　　As a fisher-boy I fared
　　To the black rock in the sea,And, while false gifts I prepared.
　　Listen'd and sang merrily,Down descended the decoy,
　　Soon a fish attack'd the bait;One exultant shout of joy,--
　　And the fish was captured straight.
　　Ah! on shore, and to the wood
　　Past the cliffs, o'er stock and stone,One foot's traces I pursued,
　　And the maiden was alone.Lips were silent, eyes downcast
　　As a clasp-knife snaps the bait,With her snare she seized me fast,
　　And the boy was captured straight.
　　Heav'n knows who's the happy swain
　　That she rambles with anew!I must dare the sea again,
　　Spite of wind and weather too.When the great and little fish
　　Wail and flounder in my net,Straight returns my eager wish
　　In her arms to revel yet!
　　1815.-----MARCH.
　　THE snow-flakes fall in showers,
　　The time is absent still,When all Spring's beauteous flowers,When all Spring's beauteous flowers
　　Our hearts with joy shall fill.
　　With lustre false and fleeting
　　The sun's bright rays are thrown;The swallow's self is cheating:The swallow's self is cheating,
　　And why? He comes alone!
　　Can I e'er feel delighted
　　Alone, though Spring is near?Yet when we are united,Yet when we are united,
　　The Summer will be here.
　　1817.-----APRIL.
　　TELL me, eyes, what 'tis ye're seeking;
　　For ye're saying something sweet,
　　Fit the ravish'd ear to greet,Eloquently, softly speaking.
　　Yet I see now why ye're roving;
　　For behind those eyes so bright,
　　To itself abandon'd quite,Lies a bosom, truthful, loving,--
　　One that it must fill with pleasure
　　'Mongst so many, dull and blind,
　　One true look at length to find,That its worth can rightly treasure.
　　Whilst I'm lost in studying ever
　　To explain these cyphers duly,--
　　To unravel my looks trulyIn return be your endeavour!
　　1820.-----MAY.
　　LIGHT and silv'ry cloudlets hover
　　In the air, as yet scarce warm;Mild, with glimmer soft tinged over,
　　Peeps the sun through fragrant balm.Gently rolls and heaves the ocean
　　As its waves the bank o'erflow.And with ever restless motion
　　Moves the verdure to and fro,
　　Mirror'd brightly far below.
　　What is now the foliage moving?
　　Air is still, and hush'd the breeze,Sultriness, this fullness loving,
　　Through the thicket, from the trees.Now the eye at once gleams brightly,
　　See! the infant band with mirthMoves and dances nimbly, lightly,
　　As the morning gave it birth,
　　Flutt'ring two and two o'er earth.
　　*      *      *      *
　　1816.-----JUNE.
　　SHE behind yon mountain lives,Who my love's sweet guerdon gives.Tell me, mount, how this can be!Very glass thou seem'st to me,And I seem to be close by,For I see her drawing nigh;Now, because I'm absent, sad,Now, because she sees me, glad!
　　Soon between us rise to sightValleys cool, with bushes light,Streams and meadows; next appear
　　Mills and wheels, the surest tokenThat a level spot is near,
　　Plains far-stretching and unbroken.And so onwards, onwards roam,To my garden and my home!
　　But how comes it then to pass?All this gives no joy, alas!--I was ravish'd by her sight,By her eyes so fair and bright,By her footstep soft and light.How her peerless charms I praised,When from head to foot I gazed!I am here, she's far away,--I am gone, with her to stay.
　　If on rugged hills she wander,
　　If she haste the vale along,Pinions seem to flutter yonder,
　　And the air is fill'd with song;With the glow of youth still playing,
　　Joyous vigour in each limb,One in silence is delaying,
　　She alone 'tis blesses him.
　　Love, thou art too fair, I ween!Fairer I have never seen!From the heart full easilyBlooming flowers are cull'd by thee.If I think: "Oh, were it so,"Bone and marrow seen to glow!If rewarded by her love,Can I greater rapture prove?
　　And still fairer is the bride,When in me she will confide,When she speaks and lets me knowAll her tale of joy and woe.All her lifetime's historyNow is fully known to me.Who in child or woman e'erSoul and body found so fair?
　　1815.-----NEXT YEAR'S SPRING.
　　THE bed of flowers
　　Loosens amain,The beauteous snowdrops
　　Droop o'er the plain.The crocus opens
　　Its glowing bud,Like emeralds others,
　　Others, like blood.With saucy gesture
　　Primroses flare,And roguish violets,
　　Hidden with care;And whatsoever
　　There stirs and strives,The Spring's contented,
　　If works and thrives.
　　'Mongst all the blossoms
　　That fairest are,My sweetheart's sweetness
　　Is sweetest far;Upon me ever
　　Her glances light,My song they waken,
　　My words make bright,An ever open
　　And blooming mind,In sport, unsullied,
　　In earnest, kind.Though roses and lilies
　　By Summer are brought,Against my sweetheart
　　Prevails he nought.
　　1816.-----AT MIDNIGHT HOUR.
　　[Goethe relates that a remarkable situation he was in one brightmoonlight night led to the composition of this sweet song, whichwas "the dearer to him because he could not say whence it cameand whither it would."]
　　AT midnight hour I went, not willingly,
　　A little, little boy, yon churchyard past,To Father Vicar's house; the stars on high
　　On all around their beauteous radiance cast,
　　At midnight hour.
　　And when, in journeying o'er the path of life,
　　My love I follow'd, as she onward moved,With stars and northern lights o'er head in strife,
　　Going and coming, perfect bliss I proved
　　At midnight hour.
　　Until at length the full moon, lustre-fraught,
　　Burst thro' the gloom wherein she was enshrined;And then the willing, active, rapid thought
　　Around the past, as round the future twined,
　　At midnight hour.
　　1818.-----TO THE RISING FULL MOON.
　　Dornburg, 25th August, 1828.
　　WILT thou suddenly enshroud thee,
　　Who this moment wert so nigh?Heavy rising masses cloud thee,
　　Thou art hidden from mine eye.
　　Yet my sadness thou well knowest,
　　Gleaming sweetly as a star!That I'm loved, 'tis thou that showest,
　　Though my loved one may be far.
　　Upward mount then! clearer, milder,
　　Robed in splendour far more bright!Though my heart with grief throbs wilder,
　　Fraught with rapture is the night!
　　1828.-----THE BRIDEGROOM.*
　　(Not in the English sense of the word, but the German, where ithas the meaning of betrothed.)
　　I SLEPT,--'twas midnight,--in my bosom woke,
　　As though 'twere day, my love-o'erflowing heart;To me it seemed like night, when day first broke;
　　What is't to me, whate'er it may impart?
　　She was away; the world's unceasing strife
　　For her alone I suffer'd through the heatOf sultry day; oh, what refreshing life
　　At cooling eve!--my guerdon was complete.
　　The sun now set, and wand'ring hand in hand,
　　His last and blissful look we greeted then;While spake our eyes, as they each other scann'd:
　　"From the far east, let's trust, he'll come again!"
　　At midnight!--the bright stars, in vision blest,
　　Guide to the threshold where she slumbers calm:Oh be it mine, there too at length to rest,--
　　Yet howsoe'er this prove, life's full of charm!
　　1828.-----SUCH, SUCH IS HE WHO PLEASETH ME.
　　FLY, dearest, fly! He is not nigh!
　　He who found thee one fair morn in Spring
　　In the wood where thou thy flight didst wing.Fly, dearest, fly! He is not nigh!Never rests the foot of evil spy.
　　Hark! flutes' sweet strains and love's refrains
　　Reach the loved one, borne there by the wind,
　　In the soft heart open doors they find.Hark! flutes' sweet strains and love's refrains,Hark!--yet blissful love their echo pains.
　　Erect his head, and firm his tread,
　　Raven hair around his smooth brow strays,
　　On his cheeks a Spring eternal plays.Erect his head, and firm his tread,And by grace his ev'ry step is led.
　　Happy his breast, with pureness bless'd,
　　And the dark eyes 'neath his eyebrows placed,
　　With full many a beauteous line are graced.Happy his breast, with pureness bless'd,Soon as seen, thy love must be confess'd.
　　His mouth is red--its power I dread,
　　On his lips morn's fragrant incense lies,
　　Round his lips the cooling Zephyr sighs.His mouth is red--its power I dread,With one glance from him, all sorrow's fled.
　　His blood is true, his heart bold too,
　　In his soft arms, strength, protection, dwells
　　And his face with noble pity swells.His blood is true, his heart bold too,Blest the one whom those dear arms may woo!
　　1816..-----SICILIAN SONG.
　　YE black and roguish eyes,
　　If ye command.Each house in ruins lies,
　　No town can stand.And shall my bosom's chain,--
　　This plaster wall,?To think one moment, deign,--
　　Shall ii not fall?
　　1811.-----SWISS SONG,
　　Up in th' mountainI was a-sitting,With the bird thereAs my guest,Blithely singing,Blithely springing,And buildingHis nest.
　　In the gardenI was a-standing,And the bee thereSaw as well,Buzzing, humming,Going, coming,And buildingHis cell.
　　O'er the meadowI was a-going,And there saw theButterflies,Sipping, dancing,Flying, glancing,And charmingThe eyes.
　　And then came myDear Hansel,And I show'd themWith glee,Sipping, quaffing,And he, laughing,Sweet kissesGave me.
　　1811.-----FINNISH SONG.
　　IF the loved one, the well-known one,Should return as he departed,On his lips would ring my kisses,Though the wolf's blood might have dyed them;And a hearty grasp I'd give him,Though his finger-ends were serpents.
　　Wind! Oh, if thou hadst but reason,Word for word in turns thou'dst carry,E'en though some perchance might perish'Tween two lovers so far distant.
　　All choice morsels I'd dispense with,Table-flesh of priests neglect too,Sooner than renounce my lover,Whom, in Summer having vanquish'd,I in Winter tamed still longer.
　　1810.-----GIPSY SONG.
　　IN the drizzling mist, with the snow high-pil'd,In the Winter night, in the forest wild,I heard the wolves with their ravenous howl,I heard the screaming note of the owl:
　　Wille wau wau wau!
　　Wille wo wo wo!
　　Wito hu!
　　I shot, one day, a cat in a ditch--The dear black cat of Anna the witch;Upon me, at night, seven were-wolves came down,Seven women they were, from out of the town.
　　Wille wau wau wau!
　　Wille wo wo wo!
　　Wito hu!
　　I knew them all; ay, I knew them straight;First, Anna, then Ursula, Eve, and Kate,And Barbara, Lizzy, and Bet as well;And forming a ring, they began to yell:
　　Wille wau wau wau!
　　Wille wo wo wo!
　　Wito hu!
　　Then call'd I their names with angry threat:"What wouldst thou, Anna? What wouldst thou, Bet?"At hearing my voice, themselves they shook,And howling and yelling, to flight they took.
　　Wille wau wau wau!
　　Wille wo wo wo!
　　Wito hu!
　　1772.-----THE DESTRUCTION OF MAGDEBURG.
　　[For a fine account of the fearful sack of Magdeburg, by Tilly,in the year 1613, see SCHILLER's History of the Thirty Years'War.]
　　OH, Magdeberg the town!Fair maids thy beauty crown,Thy charms fair maids and matrons crown;Oh, Magdeburg the town!
　　Where all so blooming stands,Advance fierce Tilly's bands;O'er gardens and o'er well--till'd landsAdvance fierce Tilly's bands.
　　Now Tilly's at the gate.Our homes who'll liberate?Go, loved one, hasten to the gate,And dare the combat straight!
　　There is no need as yet,However fierce his threat;Thy rosy cheeks I'll kiss, sweet pet!There is no need as yet.
　　My longing makes me pale.Oh, what can wealth avail?E'en now thy father may be pale.Thou mak'st my courage fail.
　　Oh, mother, give me bread!Is then my father dead?Oh, mother, one small crust of bread!Oh, what misfortune dread!
　　Thy father, dead lies he,The trembling townsmen flee,Adown the street the blood runs free;Oh, whither shall we flee?
　　The churches ruined lie,The houses burn on high,The roofs they smoke, the flames out fly,Into the street then hie!
　　No safety there they meet!The soldiers fill the Street,With fire and sword the wreck complete:No safety there they meet!
　　Down falls the houses' line,Where now is thine or mine?That bundle yonder is not thine,Thou flying maiden mine!
　　The women sorrow sore.The maidens far, far more.The living are no virgins more;Thus Tilly's troops make war!-----
　　FAMILIAR SONGS.
　　------What we sing in companySoon from heart to heart will fly.-----
　　THE Gesellige Lieder, which I have angicisled as above, asseveral of them cannot be called convivial songs, are separatedby Goethe from his other songs, and I have adhered to the samearrangement. The Ergo bibamus is a well-known drinking song inGermany, where it enjoys vast popularity.
　　ON THE NEW YEAR.
　　[Composed for a merry party that used to meet, in 1802, atGoethe's house.]
　　FATE now allows us,
　　'Twixt the departing
　　And the upstarting,Happy to be;And at the call of
　　Memory cherish'd,
　　Future and perish'dMoments we see.
　　Seasons of anguish,--
　　Ah, they must ever
　　Truth from woe sever,Love and joy part;Days still more worthy
　　Soon will unite us,
　　Fairer songs light us,Strength'ning the heart.
　　We, thus united,
　　Think of, with gladness,
　　Rapture and sadness,Sorrow now flies.Oh, how mysterious
　　Fortune's direction!
　　Old the connection,
　　New-born the prize!
　　Thank, for this, Fortune,
　　Wavering blindly!
　　Thank all that kindlyFate may bestow!Revel in change's
　　Impulses clearer,
　　Love far sincerer,More heartfelt glow!
　　Over the old one,
　　Wrinkles collected,
　　Sad and dejected,Others may view;But, on us gently
　　Shineth a true one,
　　And to the new oneWe, too, are new.
　　As a fond couple
　　'Midst the dance veering,
　　First disappearing,Then reappear,So let affection
　　Guide thro' life's mazy
　　Pathways so hazyInto the year!
　　1802.-----ANNIVERSARY SONG.
　　[This little song describes the different members of the partyjust spoken of.]
　　WHY pacest thou, my neighbour fair,
　　The garden all alone?If house and land thou seek'st to guard,
　　I'd thee as mistress own.
　　My brother sought the cellar-maid,
　　And suffered her no rest;She gave him a refreshing draught,
　　A kiss, too, she impress'd.
　　My cousin is a prudent wight,
　　The cook's by him ador'd;He turns the spit round ceaselessly,
　　To gain love's sweet reward.
　　We six together then began
　　A banquet to consume,When lo! a fourth pair singing came,
　　And danced into the room.
　　Welcome were they,--and welcome too
　　Was a fifth jovial pair.Brimful of news, and stored with tales
　　And jests both new and rare.
　　For riddles, spirit, raillery,
　　And wit, a place remain'd;A sixth pair then our circle join'd,
　　And so that prize was gain'd.
　　And yet to make us truly blest,
　　One miss'd we, and full sore;A true and tender couple came,--
　　We needed them no more.
　　The social banquet now goes on,
　　Unchequer'd by alloy;The sacred double-numbers then
　　Let us at once enjoy!
　　1802.-----THE SPRING ORACLE.
　　OH prophetic bird so bright,Blossom-songster, cuckoo bight!In the fairest time of year,Dearest bird, oh! deign to hearWhat a youthful pair would pray,Do thou call, if hope they may:Thy cuck-oo, thy cuck-oo.Ever more cuck-oo, cuck-oo!
　　Hearest thou? A loving pairFain would to the altar fare;Yes! a pair in happy youth,Full of virtue, full of truth.Is the hour not fix'd by fate?Say, how long must they still wait?Hark! cuck-oo! hark! cuck-oo!Silent yet! for shame, cuck-oo!
　　'Tis not our fault, certainly!Only two years patient be!But if we ourselves please here,Will pa-pa-papas appear?Know that thou'lt more kindness do us,More thou'lt prophesy unto us.One! cuck-oo! Two! cuck-oo!Ever, ever, cuck-oo, cuck-oo, coo!
　　If we've calculated clearly,We have half a dozen nearly.If good promises we'll give,Wilt thou say how long we'II live?Truly, we'll confess to thee,We'd prolong it willingly.Coo cuck-oo, coo cuck-oo,Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo!
　　Life is one continued feast--(If we keep no score, at least).If now we together dwell,Will true love remain as well?For if that should e'er decay,Happiness would pass away.Coo cuck-oo, coo cuck-oo,Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo!
　　1803.*(Gracefully in infinitum.)-----THE HAPPY COUPLE.
　　AFTER these vernal rains
　　That we so warmly sought,Dear wife, see how our plains
　　With blessings sweet are fraught!We cast our distant gaze
　　Far in the misty blue;Here gentle love still strays,
　　Here dwells still rapture true.
　　Thou seest whither go
　　Yon pair of pigeons white,Where swelling violets blow
　　Round sunny foliage bright.'Twas there we gather'd first
　　A nosegay as we roved;There into flame first burst
　　The passion that we proved.
　　Yet when, with plighted troth,
　　The priest beheld us fareHome from the altar both,
　　With many a youthful pair,--Then other moons had birth,
　　And many a beauteous sun,Then we had gain'd the earth
　　Whereon life's race to run.
　　A hundred thousand fold
　　The mighty bond was seal'd;In woods, on mountains cold,
　　In bushes, in the field,Within the wall, in caves,
　　And on the craggy height,And love, e'en o'er the waves,
　　Bore in his tube the light.
　　Contented we remain'd,
　　We deem'd ourselves a pair;'Twas otherwise ordain'd,
　　For, lo! a third was there;A fourth, fifth, sixth appear'd,
　　And sat around our board;And now the plants we've rear'd
　　High o'er our heads have soar'd!
　　How fair and pleasant looks,
　　On yonder beauteous spot,Embraced by poplar-brooks,
　　The newly-finish'd cot!Who is it there that sits
　　In that glad home above?Is't not our darling Fritz
　　With his own darling love?
　　Beside yon precipice,
　　Whence pent-up waters steal,And leaving the abyss,
　　Fall foaming through the wheel,Though people often tell
　　Of millers' wives so fair,Yet none can e'er excel
　　Our dearest daughter there!
　　Yet where the thick-set green
　　Stands round yon church and sad,Where the old fir-tree's seen
　　Alone tow'rd heaven to nod,--'Tis there the ashes lie
　　Of our untimely dead;From earth our gaze on high
　　By their blest memory's led.
　　See how yon hill is bright
　　With billowy-waving arms!The force returns, whose might
　　Has vanquished war's alarms.Who proudly hastens here
　　With wreath-encircled brow?'Tis like our child so dear
　　Thus Charles comes homeward now.
　　That dearest honour'd guest
　　Is welcom'd by the bride;She makes the true one blest,
　　At the glad festal tide.And ev'ry one makes haste
　　To join the dance with glee;While thou with wreaths hast graced
　　The youngest children three.
　　To sound of flute and horn
　　The time appears renew'd,When we, in love's young morn,
　　In the glad dance upstood;And perfect bliss I know
　　Ere the year's course is run,For to the font we go
　　With grandson and with son!
　　1803.*-----SONG OF FELLOWSHIP.
　　[Written and sung in honour of the birthday of the Pastor Ewaldat the time of Goethe's happy connection with Lily.]
　　IN ev'ry hour of joy
　　That love and wine prolong,The moments we'll employ
　　To carol forth this song!We're gathered in His name,
　　Whose power hath brought us here;He kindled first our flame,
　　He bids it burn more clear.
　　Then gladly glow to-night,
　　And let our hearts combine!Up! quaff with fresh delight
　　This glass of sparkling wine!Up! hail the joyous hour,
　　And let your kiss be true;With each new bond of power
　　The old becomes the new!
　　Who in our circle lives,
　　And is not happy there?True liberty it gives,
　　And brother's love so fair.Thus heart and heart through life
　　With mutual love are fill'd;And by no causeless strife
　　Our union e'er is chill'd.
　　Our hopes a God has crown'd
　　With life-discernment free,And all we view around,
　　Renews our ecstasy.Ne'er by caprice oppress'd,
　　Our bliss is ne'er destroy'd;More freely throbs our breast,
　　By fancies ne'er alloy'd.
　　Where'er our foot we set,
　　The more life's path extends,And brighter, brighter yet
　　Our gaze on high ascends.We know no grief or pain,
　　Though all things fall and rise;Long may we thus remain!
　　Eternal be our ties!
　　1775.-----CONSTANCY IN CHANGE.
　　COULD this early bliss but rest
　　Constant for one single hour!But e'en now the humid West
　　Scatters many a vernal shower.Should the verdure give me joy?
　　'Tis to it I owe the shade;Soon will storms its bloom destroy,
　　Soon will Autumn bid it fade.
　　Eagerly thy portion seize,
　　If thou wouldst possess the fruit!Fast begin to ripen these,
　　And the rest already shoot.With each heavy storm of rain
　　Change comes o'er thy valley fair;Once, alas! but not again
　　Can the same stream hold thee e'er.
　　And thyself, what erst at least
　　Firm as rocks appear'd to rise,Walls and palaces thou seest
　　But with ever-changing eyes.Fled for ever now the lip
　　That with kisses used to glow,And the foot, that used to skip
　　O'er the mountain, like the roe.
　　And the hand, so true and warm,
　　Ever raised in charity,And the cunning-fashion'd form,--
　　All are now changed utterly.And what used to bear thy name,
　　When upon yon spot it stood,Like a rolling billow came,
　　Hast'ning on to join the flood.
　　Be then the beginning found
　　With the end in unison,Swifter than the forms around
　　Are themselves now fleeting on!Thank the merit in thy breast,
　　Thank the mould within thy heart,That the Muses' favour blestNe'er will perish, ne'er depart.
　　1803.*-----TABLE SONG.
　　[Composed for the merry party already mentioned, on the occasionof the departure for France of the hereditary prince, who was oneof the number, and who is especially alluded to in the 3rdverse.]
　　O'ER me--how I cannot say,--
　　Heav'nly rapture's growing.Will it help to guide my way
　　To yon stars all-glowing?Yet that here I'd sooner be,
　　To assert I'm able,Where, with wine and harmony,
　　I may thump the table.
　　Wonder not, my dearest friends,
　　What 'tis gives me pleasure;For of all that earth e'er lends,
　　'Tis the sweetest treasure.Therefore solemnly I swear,
　　With no reservation,That maliciously I'll ne'er
　　Leave my present station.
　　Now that here we're gather'd round,
　　Chasing cares and slumbers,Let, methought, the goblet sound
　　To the bard's glad numbers!Many a hundred mile away,
　　Go those we love dearly;Therefore let us here to-day
　　Make the glass ring clearly!
　　Here's His health, through Whom we live!
　　I that faith inherit.To our king the next toast give,
　　Honour is his merit,'Gainst each in-- and outward foe
　　He's our rock and tower.Of his maintenance thinks he though,
　　More that grows his power.
　　Next to her good health I drink,
　　Who has stirr'd my passion;Of his mistress let each think,
　　Think in knightly fashion.If the beauteous maid but see
　　Whom 'tis I now call so,Let her smiling nod to me:
　　"Here's my love's health also!"
　　To those friends,--the two or three,--
　　Be our next toast given,In whose presence revel we,
　　In the silent even,--Who the gloomy mist so cold
　　Scatter gently, lightly;To those friends, then, new or old,
　　Let the toast ring brightly.
　　Broader now the stream rolls on,
　　With its waves more swelling,While in higher, nobler tone,
　　Comrades, we are dwelling,--We who with collected might,
　　Bravely cling together,Both in fortune's sunshine bright,
　　And in stormy weather.
　　Just as we are gather'd thus,
　　Others are collected;On them, therefore, as on us,
　　Be Fate's smile directed!From the springhead to the sea,
　　Many a mill's revolving,And the world's prosperity
　　Is the task I'm solving.
　　1802.-----WONT AND DONE.
　　I HAVE loved; for the first time with passion I rave!I then was the servant, but now am the slave;
　　I then was the servant of all:By this creature so charming I now am fast bound,To love and love's guerdon she turns all around,
　　And her my sole mistress I call.
　　l've had faith; for the first time my faith is now strong!And though matters go strangely, though matters go wrong,
　　To the ranks of the faithful I'm true:Though ofttimes 'twas dark and though ofttimes 'twas drear,In the pressure of need, and when danger was near,
　　Yet the dawning of light I now view.
　　I have eaten; but ne'er have thus relish'd my food!For when glad are the senses, and joyous the blood,
　　At table all else is effacedAs for youth, it but swallows, then whistles an air;As for me, to a jovial resort I'd repair,
　　Where to eat, and enjoy what I taste.
　　I have drunk; but have never thus relish'd the bowl!For wine makes us lords, and enlivens the soul,
　　And loosens the trembling slave's tongue.Let's not seek to spare then the heart-stirring drink,For though in the barrel the old wine may sink,
　　In its place will fast mellow the young.
　　I have danced, and to dancing am pledged by a vow!Though no caper or waltz may be raved about now,
　　In a dance that's becoming, whirl round.And he who a nosegay of flowers has dress'd,And cares not for one any more than the rest,
　　With a garland of mirth is aye crown'd.
　　Then once more be merry, and banish all woes!For he who but gathers the blossoming rose.
　　By its thorns will be tickled alone.To-day still, as yesterday, glimmers the star;Take care from all heads that hang down to keep far,
　　And make but the future thine own.
　　1813.-----GENERAL CONFESSION.
　　In this noble ring to-day
　　Let my warning shame ye!Listen to my solemn voice,--
　　Seldom does it name ye.Many a thing have ye intended,
　　Many a thing have badly ended,And now I must blame ye.
　　At some moment in our lives
　　We must all repent us!So confess, with pious trust,
　　All your sins momentous!Error's crooked pathways shunning.
　　Let us, on the straight road running,Honestly content us!
　　Yes! we've oft, when waking, dream'd,
　　Let's confess it rightly;Left undrain'd the brimming cup,
　　When it sparkled brightly;Many a shepherd's-hour's soft blisses,
　　Many a dear mouth's flying kissesWe've neglected lightly.
　　Mute and silent have we sat,
　　Whilst the blockheads prated,And above e'en song divine
　　Have their babblings rated;To account we've even call'd us
　　For the moments that enthrall'd us,With enjoyment freighted.
　　If thou'lt absolution grant
　　To thy true ones ever,We, to execute thy will,
　　Ceaseless will endeavour,From half-measures strive to wean us,
　　Wholly, fairly, well demean us,Resting, flagging never.
　　At all blockheads we'll at once
　　Let our laugh ring clearly,And the pearly-foaming wine
　　Never sip at merely.Ne'er with eye alone give kisses,
　　But with boldness suck in blissesFrom those lips loved dearly.
　　1803.*-----COPTIC SONG.
　　LEAVE we the pedants to quarrel and strive,
　　Rigid and cautious the teachers to be!All of the wisest men e'er seen alive
　　Smile, nod, and join in the chorus with me:"Vain 'tis to wait till the dolt grows less silly!Play then the fool with the fool, willy-nilly,--
　　Children of wisdom,--remember the word!"
　　Merlin the old, from his glittering grave,When I, a stripling, once spoke to him,--gave
　　Just the same answer as that I've preferr'd;"Vain 'tis to wait till the dolt grows less silly!Play then the fool with the fool, willy-nilly,--
　　Children of wisdom,--remember the word!"
　　And on the Indian breeze as it booms,And in the depths of Egyptian tombs,
　　Only the same holy saying I've heard:"Vain 'tis to wait till the dolt grows less silly!Play then the fool with the fool, willy-nilly,--
　　Children of wisdom,--remember the word!"
　　1789.*-----ANOTHER.
　　Go! obedient to my call,
　　Turn to profit thy young days,
　　Wiser make betimes thy breast
　　In Fate's balance as it sways,
　　Seldom is the cock at rest;Thou must either mount, or fall,
　　Thou must either rule and win,
　　Or submissively give in,Triumph, or else yield to clamour:Be the anvil or the hammer.
　　1789.-----VANITAS! VANITATUM VANITAS!
　　MY trust in nothing now is placed,
　　Hurrah!So in the world true joy I taste,
　　Hurrah!Then he who would be a comrade of mineMust rattle his glass, and in chorus combine,Over these dregs of wine.
　　I placed my trust in gold and wealth,
　　Hurrah!But then I lost all joy and health,
　　Lack-a-day!Both here and there the money roll'd,And when I had it here, behold,From there had fled the gold!
　　I placed my trust in women next,
　　Hurrah!But there in truth was sorely vex'd,
　　Lack-a-day!The False another portion sought,The True with tediousness were fraught,The Best could not be bought.
　　My trust in travels then I placed,
　　Hurrah!And left my native land in haste.
　　Lack-a-day!But not a single thing seem'd good,The beds were bad, and strange the food,And I not understood.
　　I placed my trust in rank and fame,
　　Hurrah!Another put me straight to shame,
　　Lack-a-day!And as I had been prominent,All scowl'd upon me as I went,I found not one content.
　　I placed my trust in war and fight,
　　Hurrah!We gain'd full many a triumph bright,
　　Hurrah!Into the foeman's land we cross'd,We put our friends to equal cost,And there a leg I lost.
　　My trust is placed in nothing now,
　　Hurrah!At my command the world must bow,
　　Hurrah!And as we've ended feast and strain,The cup we'll to the bottom drain;No dregs must there remain!
　　1806.-----FORTUNE OF WAR.
　　NOUGHT more accursed in war I know
　　Than getting off scot-free;Inured to danger, on we go
　　In constant victory;We first unpack, then pack again,
　　With only this reward,That when we're marching, we complain,
　　And when in camp, are bor'd.
　　The time for billeting comes next,--
　　The peasant curses it;Each nobleman is sorely vex'd,
　　'Tis hated by the cit.Be civil, bad though be thy food,
　　The clowns politely treat;If to our hosts we're ever rude,
　　Jail-bread we're forced to eat.
　　And when the cannons growl around,
　　And small arms rattle clear,And trumpet, trot, and drum resound,
　　We merry all appear;And as it in the fight may chance,
　　We yield, then charge amain,And now retire, and now advance,
　　And yet a cross ne'er gain.
　　At length there comes a musket-ball,
　　And hits the leg, please Heaven;And then our troubles vanish all,
　　For to the town we're driven,(Well cover'd by the victor's force,)
　　Where we in wrath first came,--The women, frightened then, of course,
　　Are loving now and tame.
　　Cellar and heart are open'd wide,
　　The cook's allow'd no rest;While beds with softest down supplied
　　Are by our members press'd.The nimble lads upon us wait,
　　No sleep the hostess takesHer shift is torn in pieces straight,--
　　What wondrous lint it makes!
　　If one has tended carefully
　　The hero's wounded limb,Her neighbour cannot rest, for she
　　Has also tended him.A third arrives in equal haste,
　　At length they all are there,And in the middle he is placed
　　Of the whole band so fair!
　　On good authority the king
　　Hears how we love the fight,And bids them cross and ribbon bring,
　　Our coat and breast to dight.Say if a better fate can e'er
　　A son of Mars pursue!'Midst tears at length we go from there,
　　Beloved and honour'd too.
　　1814.-----OPEN TABLE.
　　MANY a guest I'd see to-day,
　　Met to taste my dishes!Food in plenty is prepar'd,
　　Birds, and game, and fishes.Invitations all have had,
　　All proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!
　　Are they hither wending?
　　Pretty girls I hope to see,
　　Dear and guileless misses,Ignorant how sweet it is
　　Giving tender kisses.Invitations all have had,
　　All proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!
　　Are they hither wending?
　　Women also I expect,
　　Loving tow'rd their spouses,Whose rude grumbling in their breasts
　　Greater love but rouses.Invitations they've had too,
　　All proposed attending!Johnny, go and look around!
　　Are they hither wending?
　　I've too ask'd young gentlemen,
　　Who are far from haughty,And whose purses are well-stock'd,
　　Well-behaved, not haughty.These especially I ask'd,
　　All proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!
　　Are they hither wending?
　　Men I summon'd with respect,
　　Who their own wives treasure;Who in ogling other Fair
　　Never take a pleasure.To my greetings they replied,
　　All proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!
　　Are they hither wending?
　　Then to make our joy complete,
　　Poets I invited,Who love other's songs far more
　　Than what they've indited.All acceded to my wish,
　　All proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!
　　Are they hither wending?
　　Not a single one appears,
　　None seem this way posting.All the soup boils fast away,
　　Joints are over-roasting.Ah, I fear that we have been
　　Rather too unbending!Johnny, tell me what you think!
　　None are hither wending.
　　Johnny, run and quickly bring
　　Other guests to me now!Each arriving as he is--
　　That's the plan, I see now.In the town at once 'tis known,
　　Every one's commending.Johnny, open all the doors:
　　All are hither wending!
　　1815.*-----THE RECKONING.
　　LEADER.
　　LET no cares now hover o'er us
　　Let the wine unsparing run!Wilt thou swell our merry chorus?
　　Hast thou all thy duty done?
　　SOLO.
　　Two young folks--the thing is curious--
　　Loved each other; yesterdayBoth quite mild, to-day quite furious,
　　Next day, quite the deuce to pay!If her neck she there was stooping,
　　He must here needs pull his hair.I revived their spirits drooping,
　　And they're now a happy pair.
　　CHORUS.
　　Surely we for wine may languish!
　　Let the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish
　　Thou to-day in joy hast drown'd.
　　SOLO.
　　Why, young orphan, all this wailing?
　　"Would to heaven that I were dead!For my guardian's craft prevailing
　　Soon will make me beg my bread."Knowing well the rascal genus,
　　Into court I dragg'd the knave;Fair the judges were between us,
　　And the maiden's wealth did save.
　　CHORUS.
　　Surely we for wine may languish!
　　Let the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish
　　Thou to-day in joy hast drown'd.
　　SOLO.
　　To a little fellow, quiet,
　　Unpretending and subdued,Has a big clown, running riot,
　　Been to-day extremely rude.I bethought me of my duty,
　　And my courage swell'd apace,So I spoil'd the rascal's beauty,
　　Slashing him across the face.
　　CHORUS.
　　Surely we for wine may languish!
　　Let the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish
　　Thou to-day in joy hast drown'd.
　　SOLO.
　　Brief must be my explanation,
　　For I really have done nought.Free from trouble and vexation,
　　I a landlord's business bought.There I've done, with all due ardour,
　　All that duty order'd me;Each one ask'd me for the larder,
　　And there was no scarcity.
　　CHORUS.
　　Surely we for wine may languish!
　　Let the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish
　　Thou to-day in joy hast drown'd.
　　LEADER.
　　Each should thus make proclamation
　　Of what he did well to-day!That's the match whose conflagration
　　Should inflame our tuneful lay.Let it be our precept ever
　　To admit no waverer here!For to act the good endeavour,
　　None but rascals meek appear.
　　CHORUS.
　　Surely we for wine may languish!
　　Let the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish
　　We have now in rapture drown'd.
　　TRIO.
　　Let each merry minstrel enter,
　　He's right welcome to our hall!'Tis but with the self膖ormentor
　　That we are not liberal;
　　For we fear that his caprices,
　　That his eye-brows dark and sad,That his grief that never ceases
　　Hide an empty heart, or bad.
　　CHORUS.
　　No one now for wine shall languish!
　　Here no minstrel shall be found,Who all sighs and groans of anguish,
　　Has not first in rapture drown'd!
　　1810.-----ERGO BIBAMUS!
　　FOR a praiseworthy object we're now gather'd here,
　　So, brethren, sing: ERGO BIBAMUS!Tho' talk may be hush'd, yet the glasses ring clear,
　　Remember then: ERGO BIBAMUS!In truth 'tis an old, 'tis an excellent word,With its sound so befitting each bosom is stirr'd,And an echo the festal hall filling is heard,
　　A glorious ERGO BIBAMUS!
　　I saw mine own love in her beauty so rare,
　　And bethought me of: ERGO BIBAMUS;So I gently approach'd, and she let me stand there,
　　While I help'd myself, thinking: BIBAMUS!And when she's appeased, and will clasp you and kiss,Or when those embraces and kisses ye miss,Take refuge, till sound is some worthier bliss,
　　In the comforting ERGO BIBAMUS!
　　I am call'd by my fate far away from each friend;
　　Ye loved ones, then: ERGO BIBAMUS!With wallet light-laden from hence I must wend.
　　So double our ERGO BIBAMUS!Whate'er to his treasures the niggard may add,Yet regard for the joyous will ever be had,For gladness lends over its charms to the glad,
　　So, brethren, sing; ERGO BIBAMUS!
　　And what shall we say of to-day as it flies?
　　I thought but of: ERGO BIBAMUS'Tis one of those truly that seldom arise,
　　So again and again sing: BIBAMUS!For joy through a wide-open portal it guides,Bright glitter the clouds, as the curtain divides,An a form, a divine one, to greet us in glides,
　　While we thunder our: ERGO BIBAMUS!
　　1810.-----EPIPHANIAS.
　　THE three holy kings with their star's bright ray,--They eat and they drink, but had rather not pay;They like to eat and drink away,They eat and drink, but had rather not pay.
　　The three holy kings have all come here,In number not four, but three they appear;And if a fourth join'd the other three,Increased by one their number would be.
　　The first am I,--the fair and the white,I ought to be seen when the sun shines bright!But, alas! with all my spices and myrrh,No girl now likes me,--I please not her.
　　The next am I,--the brown and the long,Known well to women, known well to song.Instead of spices, 'tis gold I bear,And so I'm welcome everywhere.
　　The last am I,--the black and small,And fain would be right merry withal.I like to eat and to drink full measure,I eat and drink, and give thanks with pleasure.
　　The three holy kings are friendly and mild,They seek the Mother, and seek the Child;The pious Joseph is sitting by,The ox and the ass on their litter lie.
　　We're bringing gold, we're bringing myrrh,The women incense always prefer;And if we have wine of a worthy growth,We three to drink like six are not loth.
　　As here we see fair lads and lasses,But not a sign of oxen or asses,We know that we have gone astrayAnd so go further on our way.-----
　　BALLADS.
　　-----Poet's art is ever ableTo endow with truth mere fable.----MIGNON.[This universally known poem is also to be found in WilhelmMeister.]
　　KNOW'ST thou the land where the fair citron blows,Where the bright orange midst the foliage glows,Where soft winds greet us from the azure skies,Where silent myrtles, stately laurels rise,Know'st thou it well?
　　'Tis there, 'tis there,That I with thee, beloved one, would repair.
　　Know'st thou the house? On columns rests its pile,Its halls are gleaming, and its chambers smile,And marble statues stand and gaze on me:"Poor child! what sorrow hath befallen thee?"Know'st thou it well?
　　'Tis there, 'tis there,That I with thee, protector, would repair!
　　Know'st thou the mountain, and its cloudy bridge?The mule can scarcely find the misty ridge;In caverns dwells the dragon's olden brood,The frowning crag obstructs the raging flood.Know'st thou it well?
　　'Tis there, 'tis there,Our path lies--Father--thither, oh repair!
　　1795.*-----THE MINSTREL.
　　[This fine poem is introduced in the second book of WilhelmMeister.]
　　"WHAT tuneful strains salute mine ear
　　Without the castle walls?Oh, let the song re-echo here,
　　Within our festal halls!"Thus spake the king, the page out-hied;The boy return'd; the monarch cried:
　　"Admit the old man yonder!"
　　"All hail, ye noble lords to-night!
　　All hail, ye beauteous dames!Star placed by star! What heavenly sight!
　　Whoe'er can tell their names?Within this glittering hall sublime,Be closed, mine eyes! 'tis not the time
　　For me to feast my wonder."
　　The minstrel straightway closed his eyes,
　　And woke a thrilling tone;The knights look'd on in knightly guise,
　　Fair looks tow'rd earth were thrown.The monarch, ravish'd by the strain,Bade them bring forth a golden chain,
　　To be his numbers' guerdon.
　　"The golden chain give not to me,
　　But give the chain to thoseIn whose bold face we shiver'd see
　　The lances of our foes.Or give it to thy chancellor there;With other burdens he may bear
　　This one more golden burden.
　　"I sing, like birds of blithesome note,
　　That in the branches dwell;The song that rises from the throat
　　Repays the minstrel well.One boon I'd crave, if not too bold--One bumper in a cup of gold
　　Be as my guerdon given."
　　The bowl he raised, the bowl he quaff'd:
　　"Oh drink, with solace fraught!Oh, house thrice-blest, where such a draught
　　A trifling gift is thought!When Fortune smiles, remember me,And as I thank you heartily,
　　As warmly thank ye Heaven!"
　　1795.*-----BALLAD
　　OF THE BANISHED AND RETURNING COUNT.
　　[Goethe began to write an opera called Lowenstuhl, founded uponthe old tradition which forms the subject of this Ballad, but henever carried out his design.]
　　OH, enter old minstrel, thou time-honour'd one!We children are here in the hall all alone,
　　The portals we straightway will bar.Our mother is praying, our father is gone
　　To the forest, on wolves to make war.Oh sing us a ballad, the tale then repeat,
　　'Till brother and I learn it right;We long have been hoping a minstrel to meet,
　　For children hear tales with delight.
　　"At midnight, when darkness its fearful veil weaves,His lofty and stately old castle he leaves,
　　But first he has buried his wealth.What figure is that in his arms one perceives,
　　As the Count quits the gateway by stealth?O'er what is his mantle so hastily thrown?
　　What bears he along in his flight?A daughter it is, and she gently sleeps on"--
　　The children they hear with delight.
　　"The morning soon glimmers. the world is so wide,In valleys and forests a home is supplied,
　　The bard in each village is cheer'd.Thus lives he and wanders, while years onward glide,
　　And longer still waxes his beard;But the maiden so fair in his arms grows amain,
　　'Neath her star all-protecting and bright,Secured in the mantle from wind and from rain--"
　　The children they hear with delight.
　　"And year upon year with swift footstep now steals,The mantle it fades, many rents it reveals,
　　The maiden no more it can hold.The father he sees her, what rapture he feels!
　　His joy cannot now be controll'd.How worthy she seems of the race whence she springs,
　　How noble and fair to the sight!What wealth to her dearly-loved father she brings!"--
　　The children they hear with delight.
　　"Then comes there a princely knight galloping by,She stretches her hand out, as soon as he's nigh,
　　But alms he refuses to give.He seizes her hand, with a smile in his eye:
　　'Thou art mine!' he exclaims, 'while I live!''When thou know'st,' cries the old man, 'the treasure that'sthere,
　　A princess thou'lt make her of right;Betroth'd be she now, on this spot green and fair--'"
　　The children they hear with delight.
　　"So she's bless'd by the priest on the hallowed place,And she goes with a smiling but sorrowful face,
　　From her father she fain would not part.The old man still wanders with ne'er-changing pace,
　　He covers with joy his sad heart.So I think of my daughter, as years pass away,
　　And my grandchildren far from my sight;I bless them by night, and I bless them by day"--
　　The children they hear with delight.
　　He blesses the children: a knocking they hear,The father it is! They spring forward in fear,
　　The old man they cannot conceal--"Thou beggar, wouldst lure, then, my children so dear?
　　Straight seize him, ye vassals of steel!To the dungeon most deep, with the fool-hardy knave!"
　　The mother from far hears the fight;She hastens with flatt'ring entreaty to crave--
　　The children they hear with delight.
　　The vassals they suffer the Bard to stand there,And mother and children implore him to spare,
　　The proud prince would stifle his ire,'Till driven to fury at hearing their prayer,
　　His smouldering anger takes fire:"Thou pitiful race! Oh, thou beggarly crew!
　　Eclipsing my star, once so bright!Ye'll bring me destruction, ye sorely shall rue!"
　　The children they hear with affright.
　　The old man still stands there with dignified mien,The vassals of steel quake before him, I ween,
　　The Count's fury increases in power;"My wedded existence a curse long has been,
　　And these are the fruits from that flower!'Tis ever denied, and the saying is true,
　　That to wed with the base-born is right;The beggar has borne me a beggarly crew,--"
　　The children they hear with affright.
　　"If the husband, the father, thus treats you with scorn,If the holiest bonds by him rashly are torn,
　　Then come to your father--to me!The beggar may gladden life's pathway forlorn,
　　Though aged and weak he may be.This castle is mine! thou hast made it thy prey,
　　Thy people 'twas put me to flight;The tokens I bear will confirm what I say"--
　　The children they hear with delight.
　　"The king who erst govern'd returneth again,And restores to the Faithful the goods that were ta'en,
　　I'll unseal all my treasures the while;The laws shall be gentle, and peaceful the reign"--
　　The old man thus cries with a smile--"Take courage, my son! all hath turned out for good,
　　And each hath a star that is bright,Those the princess hath borne thee are princely in blood,"--
　　The children thy hear with delight.
　　1816.-----THE VIOLET.
　　UPON the mead a violet stood,Retiring, and of modest mood,
　　In truth, a violet fair.Then came a youthful shepherdess,And roam'd with sprightly joyousness,And blithely woo'd
　　With carols sweet the air
　　"Ah!" thought the violet, "had I beenFor but the smallest moment e'en
　　Nature's most beauteous flower,'Till gather'd by my love, and press'd,When weary, 'gainst her gentle breast,For e'en, for e'en
　　One quarter of an hour!"
　　Alas! alas! the maid drew nigh,The violet failed to meet her eye,
　　She crush'd the violet sweet.It sank and died, yet murmur'd not:"And if I die, oh, happy lot,For her I die,
　　And at her very feet!"
　　1775.*-----THE FAITHLESS BOY.
　　THERE was a wooer blithe and gay,
　　A son of France was he,--Who in his arms for many a day,
　　As though his bride were she,A poor young maiden had caress'd,And fondly kiss'd, and fondly press'd,
　　And then at length deserted.
　　When this was told the nut-brown maid,
　　Her senses straightway fled;She laugh'd and wept, and vow'd and pray'd,
　　And presently was dead.The hour her soul its farewell took,The boy was sad, with terror shook,
　　Then sprang upon his charger.
　　He drove his spurs into his side,
　　And scour'd the country round;But wheresoever he might ride,
　　No rest for him was found.For seven long days and nights he rode,It storm'd, the waters overflow'd,
　　It bluster'd, lighten'd, thunder'd.
　　On rode he through the tempest's din,
　　Till he a building spied;In search of shelter crept he in,
　　When he his steed had tied.And as he groped his doubtful way,The ground began to rock and sway,--
　　He fell a hundred fathoms.
　　When he recover'd from the blow,
　　He saw three lights pass by;He sought in their pursuit to go,
　　The lights appear'd to fly.They led his footsteps all astray,Up, down, through many a narrow way
　　Through ruin'd desert cellars.
　　When lo! he stood within a hall,
　　With hollow eyes. and grinning all;They bade him taste the fare.
　　A hundred guests sat there.He saw his sweetheart 'midst the throng,Wrapp'd up in grave-clothes white and long;
　　She turn'd, and----*
　　1774.(* This ballad is introduced in Act II. of Claudine of VillaBella, where it is suddenly broken off, as it is here.)-----THE ERL-KING.
　　WHO rides there so late through the night dark and drear?The father it is, with his infant so dear;He holdeth the boy tightly clasp'd in his arm,He holdeth him safely, he keepeth him warm.
　　"My son, wherefore seek'st thou thy face thus to hide?""Look, father, the Erl-King is close by our side!Dost see not the Erl-King, with crown and with train?""My son, 'tis the mist rising over the plain."
　　"Oh, come, thou dear infant! oh come thou with me!Full many a game I will play there with thee;On my strand, lovely flowers their blossoms unfold,My mother shall grace thee with garments of gold."
　　"My father, my father, and dost thou not hearThe words that the Erl-King now breathes in mine ear?""Be calm, dearest child, 'tis thy fancy deceives;'Tis the sad wind that sighs through the withering leaves."
　　"Wilt go, then, dear infant, wilt go with me there?My daughters shall tend thee with sisterly careMy daughters by night their glad festival keep,They'll dance thee, and rock thee, and sing thee to sleep."
　　"My father, my father, and dost thou not see,How the Erl-King his daughters has brought here for me?""My darling, my darling, I see it aright,'Tis the aged grey willows deceiving thy sight."
　　"I love thee, I'm charm'd by thy beauty, dear boy!And if thou'rt unwilling, then force I'll employ.""My father, my father, he seizes me fast,Full sorely the Erl-King has hurt me at last."
　　The father now gallops, with terror half wild,He grasps in his arms the poor shuddering child;He reaches his courtyard with toil and with dread,--The child in his arms finds he motionless, dead.
　　1782.*-----JOHANNA SEBUS.
　　[To the memory of an excellent and beautiful girl of 17,belonging to the village of Brienen, who perished on the 13th ofJanuary, 1809, whilst giving help on the occasion of the breakingup of the ice on the Rhine, and the bursting of the dam ofCleverham.]
　　THE DAM BREAKS DOWN, THE ICE-PLAIN GROWLS,THE FLOODS ARISE, THE WATER HOWLS.
　　"I'll bear thee, mother, across the swell,
　　'Tis not yet high, I can wade right well."
　　"Remember us too! in what danger are we!
　　Thy fellow-lodger, and children three!
　　The trembling woman!--Thou'rt going away!"
　　She bears the mother across the spray.
　　"Quick! haste to the mound, and awhile there wait,
　　I'll soon return, and all will be straight.
　　The mound's close by, and safe from the wet;
　　But take my goat too, my darling pet!"
　　THE DAM DISSOLVES, THE ICE-PLAIN GROWLS,THE FLOODS DASH ON, THE WATER HOWLS.
　　She places the mother safe on the shore;
　　Fair Susan then turns tow'rd the flood once more.
　　"Oh whither? Oh whither? The breadth fast grows,
　　Both here and there the water o'erflows.
　　Wilt venture, thou rash one, the billows to brave?""THEY SHALL, AND THEY MUST BE PRESERVED FROM THE WAVE!"
　　THE DAM DISAPPEARS, THE WATER GROWLS,LIKE OCEAN BILLOWS IT HEAVES AND HOWLS.
　　Fair Susan returns by the way she had tried,
　　The waves roar around, but she turns not aside;
　　She reaches the mound, and the neighbour straight,
　　But for her and the children, alas, too late!
　　THE DAM DISAPPEAR'D,--LIKE A SEA IT GROWLS,ROUND THE HILLOCK IN CIRCLING EDDIES IT HOWLS.
　　The foaming abyss gapes wide, and whirls round,
　　The women and children are borne to the ground;
　　The horn of the goat by one is seized fast,
　　But, ah, they all must perish at last!
　　Fair Susan still stands-there, untouch'd by the wave;
　　The youngest, the noblest, oh, who now will save?
　　Fair Susan still stands there, as bright as a star,
　　But, alas! all hope, all assistance is far.
　　The foaming waters around her roar,
　　To save her, no bark pushes off from the shore.
　　Her gaze once again she lifts up to Heaven,
　　Then gently away by the flood she is driven.
　　NO DAM, NO PLAIN! TO MARK THE PLACESOME STRAGGLING TREES ARE THE ONLY TRACE.
　　The rushing water the wilderness covers,
　　Yet Susan's image still o'er it hovers.--
　　The water sinks, the plains re-appear.
　　Fair Susan's lamented with many a tear,--
　　May he who refuses her story to tell,
　　Be neglected in life and in death as well!
　　1809.-----THE FISHERMAN.
　　THE waters rush'd, the waters rose,
　　A fisherman sat by,While on his line in calm repose
　　He cast his patient eye.And as he sat, and hearken'd there,
　　The flood was cleft in twain,And, lo! a dripping mermaid fair
　　Sprang from the troubled main.
　　She sang to him, and spake the while:
　　"Why lurest thou my brood,With human wit and human guile
　　From out their native flood?Oh, couldst thou know how gladly dart
　　The fish across the sea,Thou wouldst descend, e'en as thou art,
　　And truly happy be!
　　"Do not the sun and moon with grace
　　Their forms in ocean lave?Shines not with twofold charms their face,
　　When rising from the wave?The deep, deep heavens, then lure thee not,--
　　The moist yet radiant blue,--Not thine own form,--to tempt thy lot
　　'Midst this eternal dew?"
　　The waters rush'd, the waters rose,
　　Wetting his naked feet;As if his true love's words were those,
　　His heart with longing beat.She sang to him, to him spake she,
　　His doom was fix'd, I ween;Half drew she him, and half sank he,
　　And ne'er again was seen.
　　1779.*-----THE KING OF THULE.*
　　(* This ballad is also introduced in Faust, where it is sung byMargaret.)
　　IN Thule lived a monarch,
　　Still faithful to the grave,To whom his dying mistress
　　A golden goblet gave.
　　Beyond all price he deem'd it,
　　He quaff'd it at each feast;And, when he drain'd that goblet,
　　His tears to flow ne'er ceas'd.
　　And when he felt death near him,
　　His cities o'er he told,And to his heir left all things,
　　But not that cup of gold.
　　A regal banquet held he
　　In his ancestral ball,In yonder sea-wash'd castle,
　　'Mongst his great nobles all.
　　There stood the aged reveller,
　　And drank his last life's-glow,--Then hurl'd the holy goblet
　　Into the flood below.
　　He saw it falling, filling,
　　And sinking 'neath the main,His eyes then closed for ever,
　　He never drank again.
　　1774.-----
　　THE BEAUTEOUS FLOWER.
　　SONG OF THE IMPRISONED COUNT.
　　COUNT.
　　I KNOW a flower of beauty rare,
　　Ah, how I hold it dear!To seek it I would fain repair,
　　Were I not prison'd here.My sorrow sore oppresses me,For when I was at liberty,
　　I had it close beside me.
　　Though from this castle's walls so steep
　　I cast mine eyes around,And gaze oft from the lofty keep,
　　The flower can not be found.Whoe'er would bring it to my sight,Whether a vassal he, or knight,
　　My dearest friend I'd deem him.
　　THE ROSE.
　　I blossom fair,--thy tale of woes
　　I hear from 'neath thy grate.Thou doubtless meanest me, the rose.
　　Poor knight of high estate!Thou hast in truth a lofty mind;The queen of flowers is then enshrin'd,
　　I doubt not, in thy bosom.
　　COUNT.
　　Thy red, in dress of green array'd,
　　As worth all praise I hold;And so thou'rt treasured by each maid
　　Like precious stones or gold.Thy wreath adorns the fairest faceBut still thou'rt not the flower whose grace
　　I honour here in silence.
　　THE LILY.
　　The rose is wont with pride to swell,
　　And ever seeks to rise;But gentle sweethearts love full well
　　The lily's charms to prize,The heart that fills a bosom true,That is, like me, unsullied too,
　　My merit values duly.
　　COUNT.
　　In truth, I hope myself unstain'd,
　　And free from grievous crime;Yet I am here a prisoner chain'd,
　　And pass in grief my time,To me thou art an image sureOf many a maiden, mild and pure,
　　And yet I know a dearer.
　　THE PINK.
　　That must be me, the pink, who scent
　　The warder's garden here;Or wherefore is he so intent
　　My charms with care to rear?My petals stand in beauteous ring,Sweet incense all around I fling,
　　And boast a thousand colours.
　　COUNT.
　　The pink in truth we should not slight,
　　It is the gardener's prideIt now must stand exposed to light,
　　Now in the shade abide.Yet what can make the Count's heart glowIs no mere pomp of outward show;
　　It is a silent flower.
　　THE VIOLET.
　　Here stand I, modestly half hid,
　　And fain would silence keep;Yet since to speak I now am bid,
　　I'll break my silence deep.If, worthy Knight, I am that flower,It grieves me that I have not power
　　To breathe forth all my sweetness.
　　COUNT.
　　The violet's charms I prize indeed,
　　So modest 'tis, and fair,And smells so sweet; yet more I need
　　To ease my heavy care.The truth I'll whisper in thine ear:Upon these rocky heights so drear,
　　I cannot find the loved one.
　　The truest maiden 'neath the sky
　　Roams near the stream below,And breathes forth many a gentle sigh,
　　Till I from hence can go.And when she plucks a flow'ret blue,And says "Forget-me-not!"--I, too,
　　Though far away, can feel it.
　　Ay, distance only swells love's might,
　　When fondly love a pair;Though prison'd in the dungeon's night,
　　In life I linger thereAnd when my heart is breaking nigh,"Forget-me-not!" is all I cry,
　　And straightway life returneth.
　　1798.-----SIR CURT'S WEDDING-JOURNEY.
　　WITH a bridegroom's joyous bearing,
　　Mounts Sir Curt his noble beast,To his mistress' home repairing,
　　There to hold his wedding feast;When a threatening foe advances
　　From a desert, rocky spot;For the fray they couch their lances,
　　Not delaying, speaking not.
　　Long the doubtful fight continues,
　　Victory then for Curt declares;Conqueror, though with wearied sinews,
　　Forward on his road he fares.When he sees, though strange it may be,
　　Something 'midst the foliage move;'Tis a mother, with her baby,
　　Stealing softly through the grove!
　　And upon the spot she beckons--
　　"Wherefore, love, this speed so wild?Of the wealth thy storehouse reckons,
　　Hast thou nought to give thy child!"Flames of rapture now dart through him,
　　And he longs for nothing more,While the mother seemeth to him
　　Lovely as the maid of yore.
　　But he hears his servants blowing,
　　And bethinks him of his bride;And ere long, while onward going,
　　Chances past a fair to ride;In the booths he forthwith buys him
　　For his mistress many a pledge;But, alas! some Jews surprise him,
　　And long-standing debts allege.
　　And the courts of justice duly
　　Send the knight to prison straight.Oh accursed story, truly!
　　For a hero, what a fate!Can my patience such things weather?
　　Great is my perplexity.Women, debts, and foes together,--
　　Ah, no knight escapes scot free!
　　1803.*-----WEDDING SONG.
　　THE tale of the Count our glad song shall record
　　Who had in this castle his dwelling,Where now ye are feasting the new-married lord,
　　His grandson of whom we are telling.The Count as Crusader had blazon'd his fame,Through many a triumph exalted his name,And when on his steed to his dwelling he came,
　　His castle still rear'd its proud head,But servants and wealth had all fled.
　　'Tis true that thou, Count, hast return'd to thy home,
　　But matters are faring there ill.The winds through the chambers at liberty roam,
　　And blow through the windows at willWhat's best to be done in a cold autumn night?Full many I've pass'd in more piteous plight;The morn ever settles the matter aright.
　　Then quick, while the moon shines so clear,
　　To bed on the straw, without fear,
　　And whilst in a soft pleasing slumber he lay,
　　A motion he feels 'neath his bed.The rat, an he likes it, may rattle away!
　　Ay, had he but crumbs there outspread!But lo! there appears a diminutive wight,A dwarf 'tis, yet graceful, and bearing a light,With orator-gestures that notice invite,
　　At the feet of the Count on the floor
　　Who sleeps not, though weary full sore.
　　"We've long been accustom'd to hold here our feast,
　　Since thou from thy castle first went;And as we believed thou wert far in the East,
　　To revel e'en now we were bent.And if thou'lt allow it, and seek not to chide,We dwarfs will all banquet with pleasure and pride,To honour the wealthy, the beautiful bride
　　Says the Count with a smile, half-asleep;--
　　"Ye're welcome your quarters to keep!"
　　Three knights then advance, riding all in a group,
　　Who under the bed were conceal'd;And then is a singing and noise-making troop
　　Of strange little figures reveal'd;And waggon on waggon with all kinds of things--The clatter they cause through the ear loudly rings--The like ne'er was seen save in castles of kings;
　　At length, in a chariot of gold,
　　The bride and the guests too, behold!
　　Then all at full gallop make haste to advance,
　　Each chooses his place in the hall;With whirling and waltzing, and light joyous dance,
　　They begin with their sweethearts the ball.The fife and the fiddle all merrily sound,Thy twine, and they glide, and with nimbleness bound,Thy whisper, and chatter, and, chatter around;
　　The Count on the scene casts his eye,
　　And seems in a fever to lie.
　　They hustle, and bustle, and rattle away
　　On table, on bench, and on stool;Then all who had joined in the festival gay
　　With their partners attempt to grow cool.The hams and the sausages nimbly they bear,And meat, fish, and poultry in plenty are there,Surrounded with wine of the vintage most rare:
　　And when they have revell'd full long,
　　They vanish at last with a song.
　　*      *      *      *      *      *
　　And if we're to sing all that further occurr'd,
　　Pray cease ye to bluster and prate;For what he so gladly in small saw and heard
　　He enjoy'd and he practis'd in great.For trumpets, and singing, and shouts without endOn the bridal-train, chariots and horsemen attend,They come and appear, and they bow and they bend,
　　In merry and countless array.
　　Thus was it, thus is it to-day.
　　1802.-----THE TREASURE-DIGGER
　　ALL my weary days I pass'd
　　Sick at heart and poor in purse.
　　Poverty's the greatest curse,
　　Riches are the highest good!And to end my woes at last,
　　Treasure-seeking forth I sped.
　　"Thou shalt have my soul instead!"
　　Thus I wrote, and with my blood.
　　Ring round ring I forthwith drew,
　　Wondrous flames collected there,
　　Herbs and bones in order fair,
　　Till the charm had work'd aright.Then, to learned precepts true,
　　Dug to find some treasure old,
　　In the place my art foretold
　　Black and stormy was the night.
　　Coming o'er the distant plain,
　　With the glimmer of a star,
　　Soon I saw a light afar,
　　As the hour of midnight knell'd.Preparation was in vain.
　　Sudden all was lighted up
　　With the lustre of a cup
　　That a beauteous boy upheld.
　　Sweetly seem'd his eves to laugh
　　Neath his flow'ry chaplet's load;
　　With the drink that brightly glow'd,
　　He the circle enter'd in.And he kindly bade me quaff:
　　Then methought "This child can ne'er,
　　With his gift so bright and fair,
　　To the arch-fiend be akin."
　　"Pure life's courage drink!" cried he:"This advice to prize then learn,--
　　Never to this place return
　　Trusting in thy spells absurd;Dig no longer fruitlessly.
　　Guests by night, and toil by day!
　　Weeks laborious, feast-days gay!
　　Be thy future magic-word!
　　1797.-----THE RAT-CATCHER.
　　I AM the bard known far and wide,The travell'd rat-catcher beside;A man most needful to this town,So glorious through its old renown.However many rats I see,How many weasels there may be,I cleanse the place from ev'ry one,All needs must helter-skelter run.
　　Sometimes the bard so full of cheerAs a child-catcher will appear,Who e'en the wildest captive brings,Whene'er his golden tales he sings.However proud each boy in heart,However much the maidens start,I bid the chords sweet music make,And all must follow in my wake.
　　Sometimes the skilful bard ye viewIn the form of maiden-catcher too;For he no city enters e'er,Without effecting wonders there.However coy may be each maid,However the women seem afraid,Yet all will love-sick be ere longTo sound of magic lute and song.
　　[Da Capo.]                  1803.*-----
　　THE SPINNER.
　　As I calmly sat and span,
　　Toiling with all zeal,Lo! a young and handsome man
　　Pass'd my spinning-wheel.
　　And he praised,--what harm was there?--
　　Sweet the things he said--Praised my flax-resembling hair,
　　And the even thread.
　　He with this was not content,
　　But must needs do more;And in twain the thread was rent,
　　Though 'twas safe before.
　　And the flax's stonelike weight
　　Needed to be told;But no longer was its state
　　Valued as of old.
　　When I took it to the weaver,
　　Something felt I start,And more quickly, as with fever,
　　Throbb'd my trembling heart.
　　Then I bear the thread at length
　　Through the heat, to bleach;But, alas, I scarce have strength
　　To the pool to reach.
　　What I in my little room
　　Span so fine and slight,--As was likely. I presume--
　　Came at last to light.
　　1800.*-----BEFORE A COURT OF JUSTICE.
　　THE father's name ye ne'er shall be told
　　Of my darling unborn life;"Shame, shame," ye cry, "on the strumpet bold!"
　　Yet I'm an honest wife.
　　To whom I'm wedded, ye ne'er shall be told,
　　Yet he's both loving and fair;He wears on his neck a chain of gold,
　　And a hat of straw doth he wear.
　　If scorn 'tis vain to seek to repel,
　　On me let the scorn be thrown.I know him well, and he knows me well,
　　And to God, too, all is known.
　　Sir Parson and Sir Bailiff, again,
　　I pray you, leave me in peace!My child it is, my child 'twill remain,
　　So let your questionings cease!
　　1815.*-----THE PAGE AND THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER.
　　PAGE.
　　WHERE goest thou? Where?Miller's daughter so fair!
　　Thy name, pray?--
　　MILLER'S DAUGHTER.
　　'Tis Lizzy.
　　PAGE.Where goest thou? Where?With the rake in thy hand?
　　MILLER'S DAUGHTER.Father's meadows and land
　　To visit, I'm busy.
　　PAGE.Dost go there alone?
　　MILLER'S DAUGHTER.By this rake, sir, 'tis shown
　　That we're making the hay;And the pears ripen fastIn the garden at last,
　　So I'll pick them to-day.
　　PAGE.Is't a silent thicket I yonder view?
　　MILLER'S DAUGHTER.Oh, yes! there are two;There's one on each side.
　　PAGE.I'll follow thee soon;When the sun burns at noonWe'll go there, o'urselves from his rays to hide,And then in some glade all-verdant and deep--
　　MILLER'S DAUGHTER.Why, people would say--
　　PAGE.Within mine arms thou gently wilt sleep.
　　MILLER'S DAUGHTER.
　　Your pardon, I pray!Whoever is kiss'd by the miller-maid,Upon the spot must needs be betray'd.
　　'Twould give me distress
　　To cover with whiteYour pretty dark dress.Equal with equal! then all is right!That's the motto in which I delight.I am in love with the miller-boy;He wears nothing that I could destroy.
　　1797.-----THE YOUTH AND THE MILLSTREAM.
　　[This sweet Ballad, and the one entitled The Maid of the Mill'sRepentance, were written on the occasion of a visit paid by Goetheto Switzerland. The Maid of the Mill's Treachery, to which thelatter forms the sequel, was not written till the following year.]
　　YOUTH.
　　SAY, sparkling streamlet, whither thou
　　Art going!With joyous mien thy waters now
　　Are flowing.Why seek the vale so hastily?Attend for once, and answer me!
　　MILLSTREAM.
　　Oh youth, I was a brook indeed;
　　But latelyMy bed they've deepen'd, and my speed
　　Swell'd greatly,That I may haste to yonder mill.And so I'm full and never still.
　　YOUTH.
　　The mill thou seekest in a mood
　　Contented,And know'st not how my youthful blood
　　'S tormented.But doth the miller's daughter fairGaze often on thee kindly there?
　　MILLSTREAM.
　　She opes the shutters soon as light
　　Is gleaming;And comes to bathe her features bright
　　And beaming.So full and snow-white is her breast,--I feel as hot as steam suppress'd.
　　YOUTH.
　　If she in water can inflame
　　Such ardour,Surely, then, flesh and blood to tame
　　Is harder.When once is seen her beauteous face,One ever longs her steps to trace.
　　MILLSTREAM.
　　Over the wheel I, roaring, bound,
　　All-proudly,And ev'ry spoke whirls swiftly round,
　　And loudly.Since I have seen the miller's daughter,With greater vigour flows the water.
　　YOUTH.
　　Like others, then, can grief, poor brook,
　　Oppress thee?"Flow on!"--thus she'll, with smiling look,
　　Address thee.With her sweet loving glance, oh say,Can she thy flowing current stay?
　　MILLSTREAM.
　　'Tis sad, 'tis sad to have to speed
　　From yonder;I wind, and slowly through the mead
　　Would wander;And if the choice remain'd with me,Would hasten back there presently.
　　YOUTH.
　　Farewell, thou who with me dost prove
　　Love's sadness!Perchance some day thou'lt breathe of love
　　And gladness.Go, tell her straight, and often too,The boy's mute hopes and wishes true.
　　1797.-----
　　THE MAID OF THE MILL'S TREACHERY.
　　[This Ballad is introduced in the Wanderjahre, in a tale calledThe Foolish Pilgrim.]
　　WHENCE comes our friend so hastily,
　　When scarce the Eastern sky is grey?Hath he just ceased, though cold it be,
　　In yonder holy spot to pray?The brook appears to hem his path,
　　Would he barefooted o'er it go?Why curse his orisons in wrath,
　　Across those heights beclad with snow?
　　Alas! his warm bed he bath left,
　　Where he had look'd for bliss, I ween;And if his cloak too, had been reft,
　　How fearful his disgrace had been!By yonder villain sorely press'd,
　　His wallet from him has been torn;Our hapless friend has been undress'd,
　　Left well nigh naked as when born.
　　The reason why he came this road,
　　Is that he sought a pair of eyes,Which, at the mill, as brightly glow'd
　　As those that are in Paradise.He will not soon again be there;
　　From out the house he quickly hied,And when he gain'd the open air,
　　Thus bitterly and loudly cried
　　"Within her gaze, so dazzling bright,
　　No word of treachery I could read;She seem'd to see me with delight,
　　Yet plann'd e'en then this cruel deed!Could I, when basking in her smile,
　　Dream of the treason in her breast?She bade kind Cupid stay awhile,
　　And he was there, to make us blest.
　　"To taste of love's sweet ecstasy
　　Throughout the night, that endless seem'd,And for her mother's help to cry
　　Only when morning sunlight beam'd!A dozen of her kith and kin,
　　A very human flood, in-press'dHer cousins came, her aunts peer'd in,
　　And uncles, brothers, and the rest.
　　"Then what a tumult, fierce and loud!
　　Each seem'd a beast of prey to be;The maiden's honour all the crowd,
　　With fearful shout, demand of me.Why should they, madmen-like, begin
　　To fall upon a guiltless youth?For he who such a prize would win,
　　Far nimbler needs must be, in truth.
　　"The way to follow up with skill
　　His freaks, by love betimes is known:He ne'er will leave, within a mill,
　　Sweet flowers for sixteen years alone.--They stole my clothes away,--yes, all!
　　And tried my cloak besides to steal.How strange that any house so small
　　So many rascals could conceal!
　　"Then I sprang up, and raved, and swore,
　　To force a passage through them there.I saw the treacherous maid once more,
　　And she was still, alas, so fairThey all gave way before my wrath,
　　Wild outcries flew about pell-mell;At length I managed to rush forth,
　　With voice of thunder, from that hell.
　　"As maidens of the town we fly,
　　We'll shun you maidens of the village;Leave it to those of quality
　　Their humble worshippers to pillage.Yet if ye are of practised skill,
　　And of all tender ties afraid,Exchange your lovers, if ye will,
　　But never let them be betray'd."
　　Thus sings he in the winter-night,
　　While not a blade of grass was green.I laugh'd to see his piteous plight,
　　For it was well-deserved, I ween.And may this be the fate of all,
　　Who treat by day their true loves ill,And, with foolhardy daring, crawl
　　By night to Cupid's treacherous mill!
　　1798.-----THE MAID OF THE MILL'S REPENTANCE.
　　YOUTH.
　　AWAY, thou swarthy witch! Go forth
　　From out my house, I tell thee!Or else I needs must, in my wrath,
　　Expel thee!What's this thou singest so falsely, forsooth,Of love and a maiden's silent truth?
　　Who'll trust to such a story!
　　GIPSY.
　　I sing of a maid's repentant fears,
　　And long and bitter yearning;Her levity's changed to truth and tears
　　All-burning.She dreads no more the threats of her mother,She dreads far less the blows of her brother,
　　Than the dearly loved-one's hatred.
　　YOUTH.
　　Of selfishness sing and treacherous lies,
　　Of murder and thievish plunder!Such actions false will cause no surprise,
　　Or wonder.When  they share their booty, both clothes and purse,--As bad as you gipsies, and even worse,
　　Such tales find ready credence.
　　GIPSY.
　　"Alas, alas! oh what have I done?
　　Can listening aught avail me?I hear him toward my room hasten on,
　　To hail me.My heart beat high, to myself I said:'O would that thou hadst never betray'd
　　That night of love to thy mother!'"
　　YOUTH.
　　Alas! I foolishly ventured there,
　　For the cheating silence misled me;Ah, sweetest! let me to thee repair,--
　　Nor dread me!When suddenly rose a fearful din,Her mad relations came pouring in.
　　My blood still boils in my body!
　　GIPSY.
　　"Oh when will return an hour like this?
　　I pine in silent sadness;I've thrown away my only true bliss
　　With madness.Alas, poor maid! O pity my youth!My brother was then full cruel in troth
　　To treat the loved one so basely!"
　　THE POET.
　　The swarthy woman then went inside,
　　To the spring in the courtyard yonder;Her eyes from their stain she purified,
　　And,--wonder!--Her face and eyes were radiant and bright,And the maid of the mill was disclosed to the sight
　　Of the startled and angry stripling!
　　THE MAID OF THE MILL.
　　Thou sweetest, fairest, dearly-loved life!
　　Before thine anger I cower;But blows I dread not, nor sharp-edged knife,--
　　This hourOf sorrow and love to thee I'll sing,And myself before thy feet I'll fling,
　　And either live or die there!
　　YOUTH.
　　Affection, say, why buried so deep
　　In my heart hast thou lain hidden?By whom hast thou now to awake from thy sleep
　　Been bidden?Ah love, that thou art immortal I see!Nor knavish cunning nor treachery
　　Can destroy thy life so godlike.
　　THE MAID OF THE MILL.
　　If still with as fond and heartfelt love,
　　As thou once didst swear, I'm cherish'd,Then nought of the rapture we used to prove
　　Is perish'd.So take the woman so dear to thy breast!In her young and innocent charms be blest,
　　For all are thine from henceforward!
　　BOTH.
　　Now, sun, sink to rest! Now, sun, arise!
　　Ye stars, be now shining, now darkling!A star of love now gleams in the skies,
　　All-sparkling!As long as the fountain may spring and run,So long will we two be blended in one,
　　Upon each other's bosoms!
　　1797.-----THE TRAVELLER AND THE FARM~MAIDEN.
　　HE.
　　CANST thou give, oh fair and matchless maiden,
　　'Neath the shadow of the lindens yonder,--
　　Where I'd fain one moment cease to wander,--Food and drink to one so heavy laden?
　　SHE.
　　Wouldst thou find refreshment, traveller weary,
　　Bread, ripe fruit and cream to meet thy wishes,--
　　None but Nature's plain and homely dishes,--Near the spring may soothe thy wanderings dreary.
　　HE.
　　Dreams of old acquaintance now pass through me,
　　Ne'er-forgotten queen of hours of blisses.
　　Likenesses I've often found, but this isOne that quite a marvel seemeth to me!
　　SHE.
　　Travellers often wonder beyond measure,
　　But their wonder soon see cause to smother;
　　Fair and dark are often like each other,Both inspire the mind with equal pleasure.
　　HE.
　　Not now for the first time I surrender
　　To this form, in humble adoration;
　　It was brightest midst the constellationIn the hail adorn'd with festal splendour.
　　SHE.
　　Be thou joyful that 'tis in my power
　　To complete thy strange and merry story!
　　Silks behind her, full of purple glory,Floated, when thou saw'st her in that hour.
　　HE.
　　No, in truth, thou hast not sung it rightly!
　　Spirits may have told thee all about it;
　　Pearls and gems they spoke of, do not doubt it,--By her gaze eclipsed,--it gleam'd so brightly!
　　SHE.
　　This one thing I certainly collected:
　　That the fair one--(say nought, I entreat thee!)
　　Fondly hoping once again to meet thee,Many a castle in the air erected.
　　HE.
　　By each wind I ceaselessly was driven,
　　Seeking gold and honour, too, to capture!
　　When my wand'rings end, then oh, what rapture,If to find that form again 'tis given!
　　SHE.
　　'Tis the daughter of the race now banish'd
　　That thou seest, not her likeness only;
　　Helen and her brother, glad though lonely,Till this farm of their estate now vanish'd.
　　HE.
　　But the owner surely is not wanting
　　Of these plains, with ev'ry beauty teeming?
　　Verdant fields, broad meads, and pastures gleaming,Gushing springs, all heav'nly and enchanting.
　　SHE.
　　Thou must hunt the world through, wouldst thou find him!--
　　We have wealth enough in our possession,
　　And intend to purchase the succession,When the good man leaves the world behind him.
　　HE.
　　I have learnt the owner's own condition,
　　And, fair maiden, thou indeed canst buy it;
　　But the cost is great, I won't deny it,--Helen is the price,--with thy permission!
　　SHE.
　　Did then fate and rank keep us asunder,
　　And must Love take this road, and no other?
　　Yonder comes my dear and trusty brother;What will he say to it all, I wonder?
　　1803.*-----EFFECTS AT A DISTANCE.
　　THE queen in the lofty hall takes her place,
　　The tapers around her are flaming;She speaks to the page: "With a nimble pace
　　Go, fetch me my purse for gaming.
　　'Tis lying, I'll pledge,
　　On my table's edge."Each nerve the nimble boy straineth,And the end of the castle soon gaineth.
　　The fairest of maidens was sipping sherbet
　　Beside the queen that minute;Near her mouth broke the cup,--and she got so wet!
　　The very devil seem'd in it
　　What fearful distress
　　'Tis spoilt, her gay dress.She hastens, and ev'ry nerve straineth,And the end of the castle soon gaineth.
　　The boy was returning, and quickly came,
　　And met the sorrowing maiden;None knew of the fact,--and yet with Love's flame,
　　Those two had their hearts full laden.
　　And, oh the bliss
　　Of a moment like this!Each falls on the breast of the other,With kisses that well nigh might smother.
　　They tear themselves asunder at last,
　　To her chamber she hastens quickly,To reach the queen the page hies him fast,
　　Midst the swords and the fans crowded thickly.
　　The queen spied amain
　　On his waistcoat a stain;For nought was inscrutable to her,Like Sheba's queen--Solomon's wooer.
　　To her chief attendant she forthwith cried
　　"We lately together contended,And thou didst assert, with obstinate pride,
　　That the spirit through space never wended,--
　　That traces alone
　　By the present were shown,--That afar nought was fashion'd--not evenBy the stars that illumine you heaven.
　　"Now see! while a goblet beside me they drain'd,
　　They spilt all the drink in the chalice;And straightway the boy had his waistcoat stain'd
　　At the furthermost end of the palace.--
　　Let them newly be clad!
　　And since I am gladThat it served as a proof so decided,The cost will by me be provided."
　　1808.-----THE WALKING BELL
　　A CHILD refused to go betimes
　　To church like other people;He roam'd abroad, when rang the chimes
　　On Sundays from the steeple.
　　His mother said: "Loud rings the bell,
　　Its voice ne'er think of scorning;Unless thou wilt behave thee well,
　　'Twill fetch thee without warning."
　　The child then thought: "High over head
　　The bell is safe suspended--"So to the fields he straightway sped
　　As if 'twas school-time ended.
　　The bell now ceas'd as bell to ring,
　　Roused by the mother's twaddle;But soon ensued a dreadful thing!--
　　The bell begins to waddle.
　　It waddles fast, though strange it seem;
　　The child, with trembling wonder,Runs off, and flies, as in a dream;
　　The bell would draw him under.
　　He finds the proper time at last,
　　And straightway nimbly rushesTo church, to chapel, hastening fast
　　Through pastures, plains, and bushes.
　　Each Sunday and each feast as well,
　　His late disaster heeds he;The moment that he bears the bell,
　　No other summons needs he.
　　1813.-----FAITHFUL ECKART,
　　"OH, would we were further! Oh, would we were home,The phantoms of night tow'rd us hastily come,
　　The band of the Sorceress sisters.They hitherward speed, and on finding us here,They'll drink, though with toil we have fetch'd it, the beer,
　　And leave us the pitchers all empty."
　　Thus speaking, the children with fear take to flight,When sudden an old man appears in their sight:
　　"Be quiet, child! children, be quiet!From hunting they come, and their thirst they would still,So leave them to swallow as much as they will,
　　And the Evil Ones then will be gracious."
　　As said, so 'twas done! and the phantoms draw near,And shadowlike seem they, and grey they appear,
　　~Yet blithely they sip and they revelThe beer has all vanish'd, the pitchers are void;With cries and with shouts the wild hunters, o'erjoy'd,
　　Speed onward o'er vale and o'er mountain.
　　The children in terror fly nimbly tow'rd home,And with them the kind one is careful to come:
　　"My darlings, oh, be not so mournful!--"They'll blame us and beat us, until we are dead."--"No, no! ye will find that all goes well," he said;
　　"Be silent as mice, then, and listen!
　　"And he by whose counsels thus wisely ye're taught,Is he who with children loves ever to sport.
　　The trusty and faithful old Eckart.Ye have heard of the wonder for many a day,But ne'er had a proof of the marvellous lay,--
　　Your hands hold a proof most convincing."
　　They arrive at their home, and their pitchers they placeBy the side of their parents, with fear on their face,
　　Awaiting a beating and scolding.But see what they're tasting: the choicest of beer!Though three times and four times they quaff the good cheer
　　The pitchers remain still unemptied.
　　The marvel it lasts till the dawning of day;All people who hear of it doubtless will say:
　　"What happen'd at length to the pitchers?"In secret the children they smile, as they wait;At last, though, they stammer, and stutter, and prate,
　　And straightway the pitchers were empty.
　　And if, children, with kindness address'd ye may be,Whether father, or master, or alderman he,
　　Obey him, and follow his bidding!And if 'tis unpleasant to bridle the tongue,Yet talking is bad, silence good for the young--
　　And then will the beer fill your pitchers!
　　1813.-----THE DANCE OF DEATH.
　　THE warder looks down at the mid hour of night,
　　On the tombs that lie scatter'd below:The moon fills the place with her silvery light,
　　And the churchyard like day seems to glow.When see! first one grave, then another opes wide,And women and men stepping forth are descried,
　　In cerements snow-white and trailing.
　　In haste for the sport soon their ankles they twitch,
　　And whirl round in dances so gay;The young and the old, and the poor, and the rich,
　　But the cerements stand in their way;And as modesty cannot avail them aught here,They shake themselves all, and the shrouds soon appear
　　Scatter'd over the tombs in confusion.
　　Now waggles the leg, and now wriggles the thigh,
　　As the troop with strange gestures advance,And a rattle and clatter anon rises high,
　　As of one beating time to the dance.The sight to the warder seems wondrously queer,When the villainous Tempter speaks thus in his ear:
　　"Seize one of the shrouds that lie yonder!"
　　Quick as thought it was done! and for safety he fled
　　Behind the church-door with all speed;The moon still continues her clear light to shed
　　On the dance that they fearfully lead.But the dancers at length disappear one by one,And their shrouds, ere they vanish, they carefully don,
　　And under the turf all is quiet.
　　But one of them stumbles and shuffles there still,
　　And gropes at the graves in despair;Yet 'tis by no comrade he's treated so ill
　　The shroud he soon scents in the air.So he rattles the door--for the warder 'tis wellThat 'tis bless'd, and so able the foe to repel,
　　All cover'd with crosses in metal.
　　The shroud he must have, and no rest will allow,
　　There remains for reflection no time;On the ornaments Gothic the wight seizes now,
　　And from point on to point hastes to climb.Alas for the warder! his doom is decreed!Like a long-legged spider, with ne'er-changing speed,
　　Advances the dreaded pursuer.
　　The warder he quakes, and the warder turns pale,
　　The shroud to restore fain had sought;When the end,--now can nothing to save him avail,--
　　In a tooth formed of iron is caught.With vanishing lustre the moon's race is run,When the bell thunders loudly a powerful One,
　　And the skeleton fails, crush'd to atoms.
　　1813.-----THE PUPIL IN MAGIC.
　　I AM now,--what joy to hear it!--
　　Of the old magician rid;And henceforth shall ev'ry spirit
　　Do whate'er by me is bid;
　　I have watch'd with rigour
　　All he used to do,
　　And will now with vigour
　　Work my wonders too.
　　Wander, wander
　　Onward lightly,
　　So that rightly
　　Flow the torrent,
　　And with teeming waters yonder
　　In the bath discharge its current!
　　And now come, thou well-worn broom,
　　And thy wretched form bestir;Thou hast ever served as groom,
　　So fulfil my pleasure, sir!
　　On two legs now stand,
　　With a head on top;
　　Waterpail in hand,
　　Haste, and do not stop!
　　Wander, wander
　　Onward lightly,
　　So that rightly
　　Flow the torrent,
　　And with teeming waters yonder
　　In the bath discharge its current!
　　See! he's running to the shore,
　　And has now attain'd the pool,And with lightning speed once more
　　Comes here, with his bucket full!
　　Back he then repairs;
　　See how swells the tide!
　　How each pail he bears
　　Straightway is supplied!
　　Stop, for, lo!
　　All the measure
　　Of thy treasure
　　Now is right!--
　　Ah, I see it! woe, oh woe!
　　I forget the word of might.
　　Ah, the word whose sound can straight
　　Make him what he was before!Ah, he runs with nimble gait!
　　Would thou wert a broom once more!
　　Streams renew'd for ever
　　Quickly bringeth he;
　　River after river
　　Rusheth on poor me!
　　Now no longer
　　Can I bear him;
　　I will snare him,
　　Knavish sprite!
　　Ah, my terror waxes stronger!
　　What a look! what fearful sight
　　Oh, thou villain child of hell!
　　Shall the house through thee be drown'dFloods I see that wildly swell,
　　O'er the threshold gaining ground.
　　Wilt thou not obey,
　　Oh, thou broom accurs'd?
　　Be thou still I pray,
　　As thou wert at first!
　　Will enough
　　Never please thee?
　　I will seize thee,
　　Hold thee fast,
　　And thy nimble wood so tough,
　　With my sharp axe split at last.
　　See, once more he hastens back!
　　Now, oh Cobold, thou shalt catch it!I will rush upon his track;
　　Crashing on him falls my hatchet.
　　Bravely done, indeed!
　　See, he's cleft in twain!
　　Now from care I'm freed,
　　And can breathe again.
　　Woe, oh woe!
　　Both the parts,
　　Quick as darts,
　　Stand on end,
　　Servants of my dreaded foe!
　　Oh, ye gods protection send!
　　And they run! and wetter still
　　Grow the steps and grows the hail.Lord and master hear me call!
　　Ever seems the flood to fill,
　　Ah, he's coming! see,
　　Great is my dismay!
　　Spirits raised by me
　　Vainly would I lay!
　　"To the side
　　Of the room
　　Hasten, broom,
　　As of old!
　　Spirits I have ne'er untied
　　Save to act as they are told."
　　1797.-----THE BRIDE OF CORINTH.
　　[First published in Schiller's Horen, in connection with afriendly contest in the art of ballad-writing between the twogreat poets, to which many of their finest works are owing.]
　　ONCE a stranger youth to Corinth came,
　　Who in Athens lived, but hoped that heFrom a certain townsman there might claim,
　　As his father's friend, kind courtesy.
　　Son and daughter, they
　　Had been wont to say
　　Should thereafter bride and bridegroom be.
　　But can he that boon so highly prized,
　　Save tis dearly bought, now hope to get?They are Christians and have been baptized,
　　He and all of his are heathens yet.
　　For a newborn creed,
　　Like some loathsome weed,
　　Love and truth to root out oft will threat.
　　Father, daughter, all had gone to rest,
　　And the mother only watches late;She receives with courtesy the guest,
　　And conducts him to the room of state.
　　Wine and food are brought,
　　Ere by him besought;
　　Bidding him good night. she leaves him straight.
　　But he feels no relish now, in truth,
　　For the dainties so profusely spread;Meat and drink forgets the wearied youth,
　　And, still dress'd, he lays him on the bed.
　　Scarce are closed his eyes,
　　When a form in-hies
　　Through the open door with silent tread.
　　By his glimmering lamp discerns he now
　　How, in veil and garment white array'd,With a black and gold band round her brow,
　　Glides into the room a bashful maid.
　　But she, at his sight,
　　Lifts her hand so white,
　　And appears as though full sore afraid.
　　"Am I," cries she, "such a stranger here,
　　That the guest's approach they could not name?Ah, they keep me in my cloister drear,
　　Well nigh feel I vanquish'd by my shame.
　　On thy soft couch now
　　Slumber calmly thou!
　　I'll return as swiftly as I came."
　　"Stay, thou fairest maiden!" cries the boy,
　　Starting from his couch with eager haste:"Here are Ceres', Bacchus' gifts of joy;
　　Amor bringest thou, with beauty grac'd!
　　Thou art pale with fear!
　　Loved one let us here
　　Prove the raptures the Immortals taste."
　　"Draw not nigh, O Youth! afar remain!
　　Rapture now can never smile on me;For the fatal step, alas! is ta'en,
　　Through my mother's sick-bed phantasy.
　　Cured, she made this oath:
　　'Youth and nature both
　　Shall henceforth to Heav'n devoted be.'
　　"From the house, so silent now, are driven
　　All the gods who reign'd supreme of yore;One Invisible now rules in heaven,
　　On the cross a Saviour they adore.
　　Victims slay they here,
　　Neither lamb nor steer,But the altars reek with human gore."
　　And he lists, and ev'ry word he weighs,
　　While his eager soul drinks in each sound:"Can it be that now before my gaze
　　Stands my loved one on this silent ground?
　　Pledge to me thy troth!
　　Through our father's oath:
　　With Heav'ns blessing will our love be crown'd."
　　"Kindly youth, I never can be thine!
　　'Tis my sister they intend for thee.When I in the silent cloister pine,
　　Ah, within her arms remember me!
　　Thee alone I love,
　　While love's pangs I prove;
　　Soon the earth will veil my misery."
　　"No! for by this glowing flame I swear,
　　Hymen hath himself propitious shown:Let us to my fathers house repair,
　　And thoult find that joy is not yet flown,
　　Sweetest, here then stay,
　　And without delay
　　Hold we now our wedding feast alone!"
　　Then exchange they tokens of their truth;
　　She gives him a golden chain to wear,And a silver chalice would the youth
　　Give her in return of beauty rare.
　　"That is not for me;
　　Yet I beg of thee,One lock only give me of thy hair."
　　Now the ghostly hour of midnight knell'd,
　　And she seem'd right joyous at the sign;To her pallid lips the cup she held,
　　But she drank of nought but blood-red wine.
　　For to taste the bread
　　There before them spread,
　　Nought he spoke could make the maid incline.
　　To the youth the goblet then she brought,--
　　He too quaff'd with eager joy the bowl.Love to crown the silent feast he sought,
　　Ah! full love-sick was the stripling's soul.
　　From his prayer she shrinks,
　　Till at length he sinks
　　On the bed and weeps without control.
　　And she comes, and lays her near the boy:
　　"How I grieve to see thee sorrowing so!If thou think'st to clasp my form with joy,
　　Thou must learn this secret sad to know;
　　Yes! the maid, whom thou
　　Call'st thy loved one now,
　　Is as cold as ice, though white as snow."
　　Then he clasps her madly in his arm,
　　While love's youthful might pervades his frame:"Thou might'st hope, when with me, to grow warm,
　　E'en if from the grave thy spirit came!
　　Breath for breath, and kiss!
　　Overflow of bliss!
　　Dost not thou, like me, feel passion's flame?"
　　Love still closer rivets now their lips,
　　Tears they mingle with their rapture blest,From his mouth the flame she wildly sips,
　　Each is with the other's thought possess'd.
　　His hot ardour's flood
　　Warms her chilly blood,
　　But no heart is beating in her breast.
　　In her care to see that nought went wrong,
　　Now the mother happen'd to draw near;At the door long hearkens she, full long,
　　Wond'ring at the sounds that greet her ear.
　　Tones of joy and sadness,
　　And love's blissful madness,
　　As of bride and bridegroom they appear,
　　From the door she will not now remove
　　'Till she gains full certainty of this;And with anger hears she vows of love,
　　Soft caressing words of mutual bliss.
　　"Hush! the cock's loud strain!
　　But thoult come again,
　　When the night returns!"--then kiss on kiss.
　　Then her wrath the mother cannot hold,
　　But unfastens straight the lock with ease"In this house are girls become so bold,
　　As to seek e'en strangers' lusts to please?"
　　By her lamp's clear glow
　　Looks she in,--and oh!
　　Sight of horror!--'tis her child she sees.
　　Fain the youth would, in his first alarm,
　　With the veil that o'er her had been spread,With the carpet, shield his love from harm;
　　But she casts them from her, void of dread,
　　And with spirit's strength,
　　In its spectre length,
　　Lifts her figure slowly from the bed.
　　"Mother! mother!"--Thus her wan lips say:
　　"May not I one night of rapture share?From the warm couch am I chased away?
　　Do I waken only to despair?
　　It contents not thee
　　To have driven me
　　An untimely shroud of death to wear?
　　"But from out my coffin's prison-bounds
　　By a wond'rous fate I'm forced to rove,While the blessings and the chaunting sounds
　　That your priests delight in, useless prove.
　　Water, salt, are vain
　　Fervent youth to chain,
　　Ah, e'en Earth can never cool down love!
　　"When that infant vow of love was spoken,
　　Venus' radiant temple smiled on both.Mother! thou that promise since hast broken,
　　Fetter'd by a strange, deceitful oath.
　　Gods, though, hearken ne'er,
　　Should a mother swear
　　To deny her daughter's plighted troth.
　　From my grave to wander I am forc'd,
　　Still to seek The Good's long-sever'd link,Still to love the bridegroom I have lost,
　　And the life-blood of his heart to drink;
　　When his race is run,
　　I must hasten on,
　　And the young must 'neath my vengeance sink,
　　"Beauteous youth! no longer mayst thou live;
　　Here must shrivel up thy form so fair;Did not I to thee a token give,
　　Taking in return this lock of hair?
　　View it to thy sorrow!
　　Grey thoult be to-morrow,
　　Only to grow brown again when there.
　　"Mother, to this final prayer give ear!
　　Let a funeral pile be straightway dress'd;Open then my cell so sad and drear,
　　That the flames may give the lovers rest!
　　When ascends the fire
　　From the glowing pyre,
　　To the gods of old we'll hasten, blest."
　　1797.-----THE GOD AND THE BAYADERE.
　　AN INDIAN LEGEND.
　　[This very fine Ballad was also first given in the Horen.](MAHADEVA is one of the numerous names of Seeva, the destroyer,--the great god of the Brahmins.)
　　MAHADEVA,* Lord of earth
　　For the sixth time comes below,
　　As a man of mortal birth,--
　　Like him, feeling joy and woe.
　　Hither loves he to repair,
　　And his power behind to leave;
　　If to punish or to spare,
　　Men as man he'd fain perceive.And when he the town as a trav'ller hath seen,Observing the mighty, regarding the mean,He quits it, to go on his journey, at eve.
　　He was leaving now the place,
　　When an outcast met his eyes,--
　　Fair in form, with painted face,--
　　Where some straggling dwellings rise.
　　"Maiden, hail!"--"Thanks! welcome here!
　　Stay!--I'll join thee in the road.'
　　"Who art thou?"--"A Bayadere,
　　And this house is love's abode."The cymbal she hastens to play for the dance,Well skill'd in its mazes the sight to entrance,Then by her with grace is the nosegay bestow'd.
　　Then she draws him, as in play,
　　O'er the threshold eagerly:
　　"Beauteous stranger, light as day
　　Thou shalt soon this cottage see.
　　I'll refresh thee, if thou'rt tired,
　　And will bathe thy weary feet;
　　Take whate'er by thee's desired,
　　Toying, rest, or rapture sweet."--She busily seeks his feign'd suff'rings to ease;Then smiles the Immortal; with pleasure he seesThat with kindness a heart so corrupted can beat.
　　And he makes her act the part
　　Of a slave; he's straight obey'd.
　　What at first had been but art,
　　Soon is nature in the maid.
　　By degrees the fruit we find,
　　Where the buds at first obtain;
　　When obedience fills the mind,
　　Love will never far remain.But sharper and sharper the maiden to prove,The Discerner of all things below and above,Feigns pleasure, and horror, and maddening pain.
　　And her painted cheeks he kisses,
　　And his vows her heart enthrall;
　　Feeling love's sharp pangs and blisses,
　　Soon her tears begin to fall.
　　At his feet she now must sink,
　　Not with thoughts of lust or gain,--
　　And her slender members shrink,
　　And devoid of power remain.And so the bright hours with gladness prepareTheir dark, pleasing veil of a texture so fair,And over the couch softly, tranquilly reign.
　　Late she falls asleep, thus bless'd,--
　　Early wakes, her slumbers fled,
　　And she finds the much-loved guest
　　On her bosom lying dead.
　　Screaming falls she on him there,
　　But, alas, too late to save!
　　And his rigid limbs they bear
　　Straightway to their fiery grave.Then hears she the priests and the funeral song,Then madly she runs, and she severs the throng:"Why press tow'rd the pile thus? Why scream thus, and rave?"
　　Then she sinks beside his bier,
　　And her screams through air resound:
　　"I must seek my spouse so dear,
　　E'en if in the grave he's bound.
　　Shall those limbs of grace divine
　　Fall to ashes in my sight?
　　Mine he was! Yes, only mine!
　　Ah, one single blissful night!"The priests chaunt in chorus: "We bear out the old,When long they've been weary, and late they've grown cold:We bear out the young, too, so thoughtless and light.
　　"To thy priests' commands give ear!
　　This one was thy husband ne'er;
　　Live still as a Bayadere,
　　And no duty thou need'st share.
　　To deaths silent realms from life,
　　None but shades attend man's frame,
　　With the husband, none but wife,--
　　That is duty, that is fame.Ye trumpets, your sacred lament haste to raiseOh, welcome, ye gods, the bright lustre of days!Oh, welcome to heaven the youth from the flame!"
　　Thus increased her torments are
　　By the cruel, heartless quire;
　　And with arms outstretching far
　　Leaps she on the glowing pyre.
　　But the youth divine outsprings
　　From the flame with heav'nly grace,
　　And on high his flight he wings,
　　While his arms his love embrace.In the sinner repentant the Godhead feels joy;Immortals delight thus their might to employ.Lost children to raise to a heavenly place.
　　1797.-----THE PARIAH.
　　I.  THE PARIAH S PRAYER.
　　DREADED Brama, lord of might!
　　All proceed from thee alone;Thou art he who judgeth right!
　　Dost thou none but Brahmins own?Do but Rajahs come from thee?
　　None but those of high estate?
　　Didst not thou the ape create,Aye, and even such as we?
　　We are not of noble kind,
　　For with woe our lot is rife;And what others deadly find
　　Is our only source of life.Let this be enough for men,
　　Let them, if they will, despise us;
　　But thou, Brama, thou shouldst prize us,All are equal in thy ken.
　　Now that, Lord, this prayer is said,
　　As thy child acknowledge me;Or let one be born in-stead,
　　Who may link me on to thee!Didst not thou a Bayadere
　　As a goddess heavenward raise?
　　And we too to swell thy praise,Such a miracle would hear.
　　1821.-----II. LEGEND.
　　[The successful manner in which Goethe employs the simplerhymeless trochaic metre in this and in many other Poems willperhaps be remarked by the reader.]
　　WATER-FETCHING goes the nobleBrahmin's wife, so pure and lovely;He is honour'd, void of blemish.And of justice rigid, stern.Daily from the sacred riverBrings she back refreshments precious;--But where is the pail and pitcher?She of neither stands in need.For with pure heart, hands unsullied,She the water lifts, and rolls itTo a wondrous ball of crystalThis she bears with gladsome bosom,Modestly, with graceful motion,To her husband in the house.
　　She to-day at dawn of morningPraying comes to Ganges' waters,Bends her o'er the glassy surface--Sudden, in the waves reflected,Flying swiftly far above her,From the highest heavens descending,She discerns the beauteous formOf a youth divine, createdBy the God's primeval wisdomIn his own eternal breast.
　　When she sees him, straightway feels sheWondrous, new, confused sensationsIn her inmost, deepest being;Fain she'd linger o'er the vision,Then repels it,--it returneth,--And, perplex'd, she bends her flood-wardsWith uncertain hands to draw it;But, alas, she draws no more!For the water's sacred billowsSeem to fly, to hasten from her;She but sees the fearful chasmOf a whirlpool black disclosed.
　　Arms drop down, and footsteps stumble,Can this be the pathway homewards?Shall she fly, or shall she tarry?Can she think, when thought and counsel,When assistance all are lost?So before her spouse appears she--On her looks he--look is judgment--Proudly on the sword he seizes,To the hill of death he drags her,Where delinquents' blood pays forfeit.What resistance could she offer?What excuses could she proffer,Guilty, knowing not her guilt?
　　And with bloody sword returns he,Musing, to his silent dwelling,When his son before him stands:"Whose this blood? Oh, father! father!""The delinquent woman's!"--"Never!For upon the sword it dries not,Like the blood of the delinquent;Fresh it flows, as from the wound.Mother! mother! hither hasten!Unjust never was my father,Tell me what he now hath done."--"Silence! silence! hers the blood is!""Whose, my father?"--"Silence! Silence!""What! oh what! my mother's blood!What her crime? What did she? Answer!Now, the sword! the sword now hold I;Thou thy wife perchance might'st slaughter,But my mother might'st not slay!Through the flames the wife is ableHer beloved spouse to follow,And his dear and only motherThrough the sword her faithful son.""Stay! oh stay!" exclaim'd the father:"Yet 'tis time, so hasten, hasten!Join the head upon the body,With the sword then touch the figure,And, alive she'll follow thee."
　　Hastening, he, with breathless wonder,Sees the bodies of two womenLying crosswise, and their heads too;Oh, what horror! which to choose!Then his mother's head he seizes,--Does not kiss it, deadly pale 'tis,--On the nearest headless bodyPuts it quickly, and then blessesWith the sword the pious work.Then the giant form uprises,--From the dear lips of his mother,Lips all god-like--changeless--blissful,Sound these words with horror fraught:"Son, oh son! what overhast'ning!Yonder is thy mother's body,Near it lies the impious headOf the woman who hath fallenVictim to the judgment-sword!To her body I am graftedBy thy hand for endless ages;Wise in counsel, wild in action,I shall be amongst the gods.E'en the heav'nly boy's own image,Though in eye and brow so lovely,Sinking downwards to the bosomMad and raging lust will stir.
　　"'Twill return again for ever,Ever rising, ever sinking,Now obscured, and now transfigur'd,--So great Brama hath ordain'd.He 'twas sent the beauteous pinions,Radiant face and slender membersOf the only God-begotten,That I might be proved and tempted;For from high descends temptation,When the gods ordain it so.And so I, the Brahmin woman,With my head in Heaven reclining,Must experience, as a Pariah,The debasing power of earth.
　　Son, I send thee to thy father!Comfort him! Let no sad penance,Weak delay, or thought of merit,Hold thee in the desert fastWander on through ev'ry nation,Roam abroad throughout all ages,And proclaim to e'en the meanest,That great Brama hears his cry!
　　"None is in his eyes the meanest--He whose limbs are lame and palsied,He whose soul is wildly riven,Worn with sorrow, hopeless, helpless,Be he Brahmin, be he Pariah,If tow'rd heaven he turns his gaze,Will perceive, will learn to know it:Thousand eyes are glowing yonder,Thousand ears are calmly list'ning,From which nought below is hid.
　　"If I to his throne soar upward,If he sees my fearful figureBy his might transform'd to horror,He for ever will lament it,--May it to your good be found!And I now will kindly warn him,And I now will madly tell himWhatsoe'er my mind conceiveth,What within my bosom heaveth.But my thoughts, my inmost feelings--Those a secret shall remain."
　　1821.-----III.  THE PARIAH'S THANKS.
　　MIGHTY Brama, now I'll bless thee!
　　'Tis from thee that worlds proceed!As my ruler I confess thee,
　　For of all thou takest heed.
　　All thy thousand ears thou keepest
　　Open to each child of earth;We, 'mongst mortals sunk the deepest,
　　Have from thee received new birth.
　　Bear in mind the woman's story,
　　Who, through grief, divine became;Now I'll wait to view His glory,
　　Who omnipotence can claim.
　　1821.-----DEATH-LAMENT OF THE NOBLE WIFE OF ASAN AGA.
　　[From the Morlack.)
　　WHAT is yonder white thing in the forest?Is it snow, or can it swans perchance be?Were it snow, ere this it had been melted,Were it swans, they all away had hastend.Snow, in truth, it is not, swans it is not,'Tis the shining tents of Asan Aga.He within is lying, sorely wounded;To him come his mother and his sister;Bashfully his wife delays to come there.When the torment of his wounds had lessen'd,To his faithful wife he sent this message:"At my court no longer dare to tarry,At my court, or e'en amongst my people."
　　When the woman heard this cruel message,Mute and full of sorrow stood that true one.At the doors she hears the feet of horses,And bethinks that Asan comes--her husband,To the tower she springs, to leap thence headlong,Her two darling daughters follow sadly,And whilst weeping bitter tears, exclaim they:These are not our father Asan's horses;'Tis thy brother Pintorowich coming!"
　　So the wife of Asan turns to meet him,Clasps her arms in anguish round her brother:"See thy sister's sad disgrace, oh brother!How I'm banish'd--mother of five children!"Silently her brother from his wallet,Wrapp'd in deep red-silk, and ready written,Draweth forth the letter of divorcement,To return home to her mother's dwelling,Free to be another's wife thenceforward.
　　When the woman saw that mournful letter,Fervently she kiss'd her two sons' foreheads,And her two girls' cheeks with fervour kiss'd she,But she from the suckling in the cradleCould not tear herself, so deep her sorrow!So she's torn thence by her fiery brother,On his nimble steed he lifts her quickly,And so hastens, with the heart-sad woman,Straightway tow'rd his father's lofty dwelling.
　　Short the time was--seven days had pass'd not,--Yet enough 'twas; many mighty princesSought the woman in her widow's-mourning.Sought the woman,--as their wife they sought her.And the mightiest was Imoski's Cadi,And the woman weeping begg'd her brother:By thy life, my brother, I entreat thee,Let me not another's wife be ever,Lest my heart be broken at the imageOf my poor, my dearly-cherish'd children!"
　　To her prayer her brother would not hearken,Fix'd to wed her to Imoski's Cadi.Yet the good one ceaselessly implored him:"Send, at least a letter, oh, my brother,With this message to Imoski's Cadi:'The young widow sends thee friendly greeting;Earnestly she prays thee, through this letter,That, when thou com'st hither, with thy Suatians,A long veil thou'lt bring me, 'neath whose shadowI may hide, when near the house of Asan,And not see my dearly cherish'd orphans.'"
　　Scarcely had the Cadi read this letter,Than he gather'd all his Suatians round him,And then tow'rd the bride his course directed,And the veil she ask'd for, took he with him.
　　Happily they reach'd the princess' dwelling,From the dwelling happily they led her.But when they approach'd the house of Asan,Lo! the children saw from high their mother,And they shouted: "To thy halls return thou!Eat thy supper with thy darling children!"Mournfully the wife of Asan heard it,Tow'rd the Suatian prince then turn'd she, saying:"Let, I pray, the Suatians and the horsesAt the loved ones' door a short time tarry,That I may give presents to my children."
　　And before the loved ones' door they tarried,And she presents gave to her poor children,To the boys gave gold-embroider'd buskins,To the girls gave long and costly dresses,To the suckling, helpless in the cradle,Gave a garment, to be worn hereafter.
　　This aside saw Father Asan Aga,--Sadly cried he to his darling children:"Hither come, ye dear unhappy infants,For your mother's breast is turn'd to iron,Lock'd for ever, closed to all compassion!"
　　When the wife of Asan heard him speak thus,On the ground, all pale and trembling, fell she,And her spirit fled her sorrowing bosom,When she saw her children flying from her.

　　CANTATAS.
　　-----May the bard these numbers praise,That are sung his fame to raise.-----
　　THE Poems composed by Goethe under this title are five innumber, of which three are here given. The other two are entirelypersonal in their allusions, and not of general interest. One ofthem is a Requiem on the Prince de Ligne, who died in 1814, andwhom Goethe calls "the happiest man of the century," and theother was composed in honour of the 70th birthday of his friendZelter the composer, when Goethe was himself more than 79 (1828).The following sweet aria introduced in the latter is, however,worth giving:--
　　THE flowers so carefully rear'd,
　　In a garland for him I oft twin'd:How sweet have they ever appear'd,
　　When wreath'd for a friend dear and kind.Then incense sweet ascended,
　　Then new-horn blossoms rose,With gentle zephyrs blended
　　In tones of soft repose.-----IDYLL.
　　A village Chorus is supposed to be assembled, and about tocommence its festive procession.
　　[Written for the birthday of the Duchess Louisa of Weimar.]
　　CHORUS.
　　THE festal day hail ye
　　With garlands of pleasure,
　　And dances' soft measure,With rapture commingledAnd sweet choral song.
　　DAMON.
　　Oh, how I yearn from out the crowd to flee!What joy a secret glade would give to me!Amid the throng, the turmoil here,Confined the plain, the breezes e'en appear.
　　CHORUS.
　　Now order it truly,That ev'ry one dulyMay roam and may wander,Now here, and now yonder,
　　The meadows along.
　　[The Chorus retreats gradually, and the song becomes fainter andfainter, till it dies away in the distance.]
　　DAMON.
　　In vain ye call, in vain would lure me on;True my heart speaks,--but with itself alone.
　　And if I may view
　　A blessing-fraught land,
　　The heaven's clear blue,
　　And the plain's verdant hue,
　　Alone I'll rejoice,
　　Undisturbed by man's voice.
　　And there I'll pay homage
　　To womanly merit,
　　Observe it in spirit,
　　In spirit pay homage;
　　To echo alone
　　Shall my secret be known.
　　CHORUS.
　　[Faintly mingling with Damon's song in the distance.]
　　To echo--alone--
　　Shall my secret--be known.--
　　MENALCAS.
　　My friend, why meet I here with thee?
　　Thou hast'nest not to join the festal throng?No longer stay, but come with me,
　　And mingle in the dance and song.
　　DAMON.
　　Thou'rt welcome, friend! but suffer me to roam
　　Where these old beeches hide me from man's view:Love seeks in solitude a home,
　　And homage may retreat there too.
　　MENALCAS.
　　Thou seekest here a spurious fame,
　　And hast a mind to-day to grieve me.Love as thy portion thou mayst claim
　　But homage thou must share with all, believe me!
　　When their voices thousands raise,And the dawn of morning praise,
　　Rapture bringing,
　　Blithely singing
　　On before us,Heart and ear in pleasure vie;
　　And when thousands join in chorus,
　　With the feelings brightly glowing,
　　And the wishes overflowing,Forcibly they'll bear thee high.
　　[The Chorus gradually approaches, from the distance.]
　　DAMON.
　　Distant strains are hither wending,
　　And I'm gladden'd by the throng;Yes, they're coming,--yes, descending
　　To the valley from the height,
　　MENALCAS.
　　Let us haste, our footsteps blending
　　With the rhythm of the song!Yes, they come; their course they're bending
　　Tow'rd the wood's green sward so bright.
　　CHORUS.[Gradually becoming louder.]
　　Yes, we hither come, attending
　　With the harmony of song,As the hours their race are ending
　　On this day of blest delight.
　　ALL.
　　Let none revealThe thoughts we feel,The aims we own!Let joy alone
　　Disclose the story!She'll prove it rightAnd her delight
　　Includes the glory,Includes the blissOf days like this!
　　1813.-----RINALDO.*
　　[This Cantata was written for Prince Frederick of Gotha, and setto music by Winter, the Prince singing the part of Rinaldo.--Seethe Annalen.]
　　(* See Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata, Canto XVI.)
　　CHORUS.
　　To the strand! quick, mount the bark!
　　If no favouring zephyrs blow,
　　Ply the oar and nimbly row,And with zeal your prowess mark!
　　O'er the sea we thus career.
　　RINALDO.
　　Oh, let me linger one short moment here!'Tis heaven's decree, I may not hence away.The rugged cliffs, the wood-encircled bay,Hold me a prisoner, and my flight delay.
　　Ye were so fair, but now that dream is o'er;The charms of earth, the charms of heaven are nought.What keeps me in this spot so terror-fraught?
　　My only joy is fled for evermore.
　　Let me taste those days so sweet,
　　Heav'n-descended, once again!Heart, dear heart! ay, warmly beat!
　　Spirit true, recall those days
　　Freeborn breath thy gentle lays
　　Mingled are with joy and pain.
　　Round the beds, so richly gleaming,
　　Rises up a palace fair;All with rosy fragrance teeming,
　　As in dream thou saw'st it ne'er.
　　And this spacious garden round,
　　Far extend the galleries;Roses blossom near the ground,
　　High in air, too, bloom the trees.
　　Wat'ry flakes and jets are falling.
　　Sweet and silv'ry strains arise;While the turtle-dove is calling,
　　And the nightingale replies.
　　CHORUS.
　　Gently come! feel no alarm,
　　On a noble duty bent;Vanish'd now is ev'ry charm
　　That by magic power was lent.Friendly words and greetings calmOn his wounds will pour soft balm.
　　Fill his mind with sweet content.
　　RINALDO.
　　Hark! the turtle-dove is calling,
　　And the nightingale replies;Wat'ry flakes and jets are falling,
　　Mingling with their melodies.
　　But all of them say:
　　Her only we mean;But all fly away,
　　As soon as she's seen,--The beauteous young maiden,
　　With graces so rife,
　　Then lily and rose
　　In wreaths are entwining;
　　In dancing combining,Each zephyr that blows
　　Its brother is greeting,
　　All flying and meeting,With balsam full laden,
　　When waken'd to life.
　　CHORUS.
　　No! no longer may we wait;Rouse him from his vision straight!Show the adamantine shield!
　　RINALDO.
　　Woe! what form is here reveal'd!
　　CHORUS.
　　'Twill disclose the cheat to thee.
　　RINALDO.
　　Am I doom'd myself to seeThus degraded evermore?
　　CHORUS.
　　Courage take, and all is o'er.
　　RINALDO.
　　Be it so! I'll take fresh heart,From the spot beloved depart,Leave Armida once again,--Come then! here no more remain.
　　CHORUS.
　　Yes, 'tis well! no more remain.
　　SEMI-CHORUS.
　　Away then! let's fly
　　O'er the zephyr-kiss'd ocean!The soul-lighted eye
　　Sees armies in motion,See proud banners wave
　　O'er the dust-sprinkled course.
　　CHORUS.
　　From his forefathers brave
　　Draws the hero new force.
　　RINALDO.
　　With sorrow laden,
　　Within this valley's
　　All-silent alleysThe fairest maiden
　　Again I see.
　　Twice can this be?What! shall I hear it,And not have spiritTo ease her pains?
　　CHORUS.
　　Unworthy chains?
　　RINALDO.
　　And now I've see her,
　　Alas! how changed!With cold demeanour.
　　And looks estranged,With ghostly tread,--All hope is fled,Yes, fled for ever.The lightnings quiver,Each palace falls;The godlike halls,Each joyous hourOf spirit-power,With love's sweet dayAll fade away!
　　CHORUS.
　　Yes, fade away!
　　SEMI-CHORUS.
　　Already are heard
　　The prayers of the pious.
　　Why longer deny us?The favouring zephyr
　　Forbids all delay.
　　CHORUS.
　　Away, then! away!
　　RINALDO.
　　With heart sadly stirr'd,
　　Your command I receive;
　　Ye force me to leave.Unkind is the zephyr,--
　　Oh, wherefore not stay?
　　CHORUS.
　　Away, then! away!
　　1811.-----THE FIRST WALPURGIS-NIGHT.
　　A DRUID.
　　SWEET smiles the May!
　　The forest gay
　　From frost and ice is freed;
　　No snow is found,
　　Glad songs resound
　　Across the verdant mead.
　　Upon the height
　　The snow lies light,
　　Yet thither now we go,There to extol our Father's name,
　　Whom we for ages know.Amid the smoke shall gleam the flame;
　　Thus pure the heart will grow.
　　THE DRUIDS.
　　Amid the smoke shall gleam the flame;Extol we now our Father's name,
　　Whom we for ages know!
　　Up, up, then, let us go!
　　ONE OF THE PEOPLE.
　　Would ye, then, so rashly act?Would ye instant death attract?Know ye not the cruel threats
　　Of the victors we obey?Round about are placed their nets
　　In the sinful heathen's way.Ah! upon the lofty wall
　　Wife and children slaughter they;And we allHasten to a certain fall.
　　CHORUS OF WOMEN.
　　Ay, upon the camp's high wall
　　All our children loved they slay.
　　Ah, what cruel victors they!And we allHasten to a certain fall.
　　A DRUID.
　　Who fears to-day
　　His rites to pay,
　　Deserves his chains to wear.
　　The forest's free!
　　This wood take we,
　　And straight a pile prepare!
　　Yet in the wood
　　To stay 'tis good
　　By day, till all is still,With watchers all around us plac'd
　　Protecting you from ill.With courage fresh, then let us haste
　　Our duties to fulfil.
　　CHORUS OF WATCHERS.
　　Ye valiant watchers, now divideYour numbers through the forest wide,
　　And see that all is still,
　　While they their rites fulfil.
　　A WATCHER.
　　Let us in a cunning wise,Yon dull Christian priests surpriseWith the devil of their talk
　　We'll those very priests confound.Come with prong, and come with fork.
　　Raise a wild and rattling soundThrough the livelong night, and prowl
　　All the rocky passes round.Screechowl, owl,Join in chorus with our howl!
　　CHORUS OF WATCHERS.
　　Come with prong, and come with fork,Like the devil of their talk,And with wildly rattling sound,Prowl the desert rocks around!Screechowl, owl,Join in chorus with our howl!
　　A DRUID.
　　Thus far 'tis right.
　　That we by night
　　Our Father's praises sing;
　　Yet when 'tis day,
　　To Thee we may
　　A heart unsullied bring.
　　'Tis true that now,
　　And often, Thou
　　Fav'rest the foe in fight.As from the smoke is freed the blaze,
　　So let our faith burn bright!And if they crush our golden ways,
　　Who e'er can crush Thy light?
　　A CHRISTIAN WATCHER.
　　Comrades, quick! your aid afford!All the brood of hell's abroad;See how their enchanted forms
　　Through and through with flames are glowing!Dragon-women, men-wolf swarms,
　　On in quick succession going!Let us, let us haste to fly!
　　Wilder yet the sounds are growing,And the archfiend roars on high;From the groundHellish vapours rise around.
　　CHORUS OF CHRISTIAN WATCHERS.
　　Terrible enchanted forms,Dragon-women, men-wolf swarms!Wilder yet the sounds are growing!See, the archfiend comes, all-glowing!From the groundHellish vapours rise around!
　　CHORUS OF DRUIDS.
　　As from the smoke is freed the blaze,
　　So let our faith burn bright!And if they crush our golden ways,
　　Who e'er can crush Thy light?
　　1799.-----
　　ODES.
　　-----
　　THESE are the most singular of all the Poems of Goethe, and tomany will appear so wild and fantastic, as to leave anything buta pleasing impression. Those at the beginning, addressed to hisfriend Behrisch, were written at the age of eighteen, and most ofthe remainder were composed while he was still quite young.Despite, however, the extravagance of some of them, such as theWinter Journey over the Hartz Mountains, and the Wanderer'sStorm-Song, nothing can be finer than the noble one entitledMahomet's Song, and others, such as the Spirit Song' over theWaters, The God-like, and, above all, the magnificent sketch ofPrometheus, which forms part of an unfinished piece bearing thesame name, and called by Goethe a 'Dramatic Fragment.'
　　TO MY FRIEND.
　　[These three Odes are addressed to a certain Behrisch, who wastutor to Count Lindenau, and of whom Goethe gives an odd accountat the end of the Seventh Book of his Autobiography.]
　　FIRST ODE.
　　TRANSPLANT the beauteous tree!Gardener, it gives me pain;A happier resting-placeIts trunk deserved.
　　Yet the strength of its natureTo Earth's exhausting avarice,To Air's destructive inroads,An antidote opposed.
　　See how it in springtimeCoins its pale green leaves!Their orange-fragrancePoisons each flyblow straight.
　　The caterpillar's toothIs blunted by them;With silv'ry hues they gleamIn the bright sunshine,
　　Its twigs the maidenFain would twine inHer bridal-garland;Youths its fruit are seeking.
　　See, the autumn cometh!The caterpillarSighs to the crafty spider,--Sighs that the tree will not fade.
　　Hov'ring thitherFrom out her yew-tree dwelling,The gaudy foe advancesAgainst the kindly tree,
　　And cannot hurt it,But the more artful oneDefiles with nauseous venomIts silver leaves;
　　And sees with triumphHow the maiden shudders,The youth, how mourns he,On passing by.
　　Transplant the beauteous tree!Gardener, it gives me pain;Tree, thank the gardenerWho moves thee hence!
　　1767.-----SECOND ODE.
　　THOU go'st! I murmur--Go! let me murmur.Oh, worthy man,Fly from this land!
　　Deadly marshes,Steaming mists of OctoberHere interweave their currents,Blending for ever.
　　Noisome insectsHere are engender'd;Fatal darknessVeils their malice.
　　The fiery-tongued serpent,Hard by the sedgy bank,Stretches his pamper'd body,Caress'd by the sun's bright beams.
　　Tempt no gentle night-ramblesUnder the moon's cold twilight!Loathsome toads hold their meetingsYonder at every crossway.
　　Injuring not,Fear will they cause thee.Oh, worthy man,Fly from this land!
　　1767.-----THIRD ODE.
　　BE void of feeling!A heart that soon is stirr'd,Is a possession sadUpon this changing earth.
　　Behrisch, let spring's sweet smileNever gladden thy brow!Then winter's gloomy tempestsNever will shadow it o'er.
　　Lean thyself ne'er on a maiden'sSorrow-engendering breast.Ne'er on the arm,Misery-fraught, of a friend.
　　Already envyFrom out his rocky ambushUpon thee turnsThe force of his lynx-like eyes,
　　Stretches his talons,On thee falls,In thy shouldersCunningly plants them.
　　Strong are his skinny arms,As panther-claws;He shaketh thee,And rends thy frame.
　　Death 'tis to part,'Tis threefold deathTo part, not hopingEver to meet again.
　　Thou wouldst rejoice to leaveThis hated land behind,Wert thou not chain'd to meWith friendships flowery chains.
　　Burst them! I'll not repine.No noble friendWould stay his fellow-captive,If means of flight appear.
　　The remembranceOf his dear friend's freedomGives him freedomIn his dungeon.
　　Thou go'st,--I'm left.But e'en alreadyThe last year's winged spokesWhirl round the smoking axle.
　　I number the turnsOf the thundering wheel;The last one I bless.--Each bar then is broken, I'm free then as thou!
　　1767.-----MAHOMET'S SONG.
　　[This song was intended to be introduced in a dramatic poementitled Mahomet, the plan of which was not carried out byGoethe. He mentions that it was to have been sung by Ali towardsthe end of the piece, in honor of his master, Mahomet, shortlybefore his death, and when at the height of his glory, of whichit is typical.]
　　SEE the rock-born stream!Like the gleamOf a star so brightKindly spiritsHigh above the cloudsNourished him while youthfulIn the copse between the cliffs.
　　Young and fresh.From the clouds he dancethDown upon the marble rocks;Then tow'rd heavenLeaps exulting.
　　Through the mountain-passesChaseth he the colour'd pebbles,And, advancing like a chief,Tears his brother streamlets with himIn his course.
　　In the valley down below'Neath his footsteps spring the flowers,And the meadowIn his breath finds life.
　　Yet no shady vale can stay him,Nor can flowers,Round his knees all-softly twiningWith their loving eyes detain him;To the plain his course he taketh,Serpent-winding,
　　Social streamletsJoin his waters. And now moves heO'er the plain in silv'ry glory,And the plain in him exults,And the rivers from the plain,And the streamlets from the mountain,Shout with joy, exclaiming: "Brother,Brother, take thy brethren with thee,With thee to thine aged father,To the everlasting ocean,Who, with arms outstretching far,Waiteth for us;Ah, in vain those arms lie openTo embrace his yearning children;For the thirsty sand consumes usIn the desert waste; the sunbeamsDrink our life-blood; hills around usInto lakes would dam us! Brother,Take thy brethren of the plain,Take thy brethren of the mountainWith thee, to thy father's arms!
　　Let all come, then!--And now swells heLordlier still; yea, e'en a peopleBears his regal flood on high!And in triumph onward rolling,Names to countries gives he,--citiesSpring to light beneath his foot.
　　Ever, ever, on he rushes,Leaves the towers' flame-tipp'd summits,Marble palaces, the offspringOf his fullness, far behind.
　　Cedar-houses bears the AtlasOn his giant shoulders; flutt'ringIn the breeze far, far above himThousand flags are gaily floating,Bearing witness to his might.
　　And so beareth he his brethren,All his treasures, all his children,Wildly shouting, to the bosomOf his long-expectant sire.
　　1774.-----SPIRIT SONG OVER THE WATERS.
　　THE soul of manResembleth water:From heaven it cometh,To heaven it soareth.And then againTo earth descendeth,Changing ever.
　　Down from the loftyRocky wallStreams the bright flood,Then spreadeth gentlyIn cloudy billowsO'er the smooth rock,And welcomed kindly,Veiling, on roams it,Soft murmuring,Tow'rd the abyss.
　　Cliffs projectingOppose its progress,--Angrily foams itDown to the bottom,Step by step.
　　Now, in flat channel,Through the meadowland steals it,And in the polish'd lakeEach constellationJoyously peepeth.
　　Wind is the lovingWooer of waters;Wind blends togetherBillows all-foaming.
　　Spirit of man,Thou art like unto water!Fortune of man,Thou art like unto wind!
　　1789.*-----MY GODDESS.
　　SAY, which ImmortalMerits the highest reward?With none contend I,But I will give itTo the aye-changing,Ever-movingWondrous daughter of Jove.His best-beloved offspring.Sweet Phantasy.
　　For unto herHath he grantedAll the fancies which erstTo none allow'd heSaving himself;Now he takes his pleasureIn the mad one.
　　She may, crowned with roses,With staff twined round with lilies,Roam thro' flow'ry valleys,Rule the butterfly-people,And soft-nourishing dewWith bee-like lipsDrink from the blossom:
　　Or else she mayWith fluttering hairAnd gloomy looksSigh in the windRound rocky cliffs,And thousand-hued.Like morn and even.Ever changing,Like moonbeam's light,To mortals appear.
　　Let us all, then,Adore the Father!The old, the mighty,Who such a beauteousNe'er-fading spouseDeigns to accordTo perishing mortals!
　　To us aloneDoth he unite her,With heavenly bonds,While he commands her,in joy and sorrow,As a true spouseNever to fly us.
　　All the remainingRaces so poorOf life-teeming earth.In children so rich.Wander and feedIn vacant enjoyment,And 'mid the dark sorrowsOf evanescentRestricted life,--Bow'd by the heavyYoke of Necessity.
　　But unto us heHath his most versatile,Most cherished daughterGranted,--what joy!
　　Lovingly greet herAs a beloved one!Give her the woman'sPlace in our home!
　　And oh, may the agedStepmother WisdomHer gentle spiritNe'er seek to harm!
　　Yet know I her sister,The older, sedater,Mine own silent friend;Oh, may she never,Till life's lamp is quench'd,Turn away from me,--That noble inciter,Comforter,--Hope!
　　1781.-----WINTER JOURNEY OVER THE HARTZ MOUNTAINS.
　　[The following explanation is necessary, in order to make thisode in any way intelligible. The Poet is supposed to leave hiscompanions, who are proceeding on a hunting expedition in winter,in order himself to pay a visit to a hypochondriacal friend, andalso to see the mining in the Hartz mountains. The odealternately describes, in a very fragmentary and peculiar manner,the naturally happy disposition of the Poet himself and theunhappiness of his friend; it pictures the wildness of the roadand the dreariness of the prospect, which is relieved at one spotby the distant sight of a town, a very vague allusion to which ismade in the third strophe; it recalls the hunting party on whichhis companions have gone; and after an address to Love, concludesby a contrast between the unexplored recesses of the highest peakof the Hartz and the metalliferous veins of its smallerbrethren.]
　　LIKE the vultureWho on heavy morning cloudsWith gentle wing reposingLooks for his prey,--Hover, my song!
　　For a God hathUnto each prescribedHis destined path,Which the happy oneRuns o'er swiftlyTo his glad goal:He whose heart cruelFate hath contracted,Struggles but vainlyAgainst all the barriersThe brazen thread raises,But which the harsh shearsMust one day sever.
　　Through gloomy thicketsPresseth the wild deer on,And with the sparrowsLong have the wealthySettled themselves in the marsh.
　　Easy 'tis following the chariotThat by Fortune is driven,Like the baggage that movesOver well-mended highwaysAfter the train of a prince.
　　But who stands there apart?In the thicket, lost is his path;Behind him the bushesAre closing together,The grass springs up again,The desert engulphs him.
　　Ah, who'll heal his afflictions,To whom balsam was poison,Who, from love's fullness,Drank in misanthropy only?First despised, and now a despiser,He, in secret, wastethAll that he is worth,In a selfishness vain.If there be, on thy psaltery,Father of Love, but one toneThat to his ear may be pleasing,Oh, then, quicken his heart!Clear his cloud-enveloped eyesOver the thousand fountainsClose by the thirsty oneIn the desert.
　　Thou who createst much joy,For each a measure o'erflowing,Bless the sons of the chaseWhen on the track of the prey,With a wild thirsting for blood,Youthful and joyousAvenging late the injusticeWhich the peasant resistedVainly for years with his staff.
　　But the lonely one veilWithin thy gold clouds!Surround with winter-green,Until the roses bloom again,The humid locks,Oh Love, of thy minstrel!
　　With thy glimmering torchLightest thou himThrough the fords when 'tis night,Over bottomless placesOn desert-like plains;With the thousand colours of morningGladd'nest his bosom;With the fierce-biting stormBearest him proudly on high;Winter torrents rush from the cliffs,--Blend with his psalms;An altar of grateful delightHe finds in the much-dreaded mountain'sSnow-begirded summit,Which foreboding nationsCrown'd with spirit-dances.
　　Thou stand'st with breast inscrutable,Mysteriously disclosed,High o'er the wondering world,And look'st from cloudsUpon its realms and its majesty,Which thou from the veins of thy brethrenNear thee dost water.
　　1777.-----TO FATHER* KRONOS.
　　[written in a post-chaise.]
　　(* In the original, Schwager, which has the twofold meaning ofbrother-in-law and postilion.)
　　HASTEN thee, Kronos!On with clattering trotDownhill goeth thy path;Loathsome dizziness ever,When thou delayest, assails me.Quick, rattle along,Over stock and stone let thy trotInto life straightway lead
　　Now once moreUp the toilsome ascentHasten, panting for breath!Up, then, nor idle be,--Striving and hoping, up, up!
　　Wide, high, glorious the viewGazing round upon life,While from mount unto mountHovers the spirit eterne,Life eternal foreboding.
　　Sideways a roof's pleasant shadeAttracts thee,And a look that promises coolnessOn the maidenly threshold.There refresh thee! And, maiden,Give me this foaming draught also,Give me this health-laden look!
　　Down, now! quicker still, down!See where the sun setsEre he sets, ere old ageSeizeth me in the morass,Ere my toothless jaws mumble,And my useless limbs totter;While drunk with his farewell beamHurl me,--a fiery seaFoaming still in mine eye,--Hurl me, while dazzled and reeling,Down to the gloomy portal of hell.
　　Blow, then, gossip, thy horn,Speed on with echoing trot,So that Orcus may know we are coming;So that our host may with joyWait at the door to receive us.
　　1774.-----THE WANDERER'S STORM-SONG.
　　[Goethe says of this ode, that it is the only one remaining outof several strange hymns and dithyrambs composed by him at aperiod of great unhappiness, when the love-affair between him andFrederica had been broken off by him. He used to sing them whilewandering wildly about the country. This particular one wascaused by his being caught in a tremendous storm on one of theseoccasions. He calls it a half-crazy piece (halkunsinn), and thereader will probably agree with him.]
　　He whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Feels no dread within his heartAt the tempest or the rain.He whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Will to the rain-clouds,Will to the hailstorm,Sing in replyAs the lark sings,Oh thou on high!
　　Him whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Thou wilt raise above the mud-trackWith thy fiery pinions.He will wander,As, with flowery feet,Over Deucalion's dark flood,Python-slaying, light, glorious,Pythius Apollo.
　　Him whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Thou wilt place upon thy fleecy pinionWhen he sleepeth on the rock,--Thou wilt shelter with thy guardian wingIn the forest's midnight hour.
　　Him whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Thou wilt wrap up warmlyIn the snow-drift;Tow'rd the warmth approach the Muses,Tow'rd the warmth approach the Graces.
　　Ye Muses, hover round me!Ye Graces also!That is water, that is earth,And the son of water and of earthOver which I wander,Like the gods.
　　Ye are pure, like the heart of the water,Ye are pure like the marrow of earth,Hov'ring round me, while I hoverOver water, o'er the earthLike the gods.
　　Shall he, then, return,The small, the dark, the fiery peasant?Shall he, then, return, waitingOnly thy gifts, oh Father Bromius,And brightly gleaming, warmth-spreading fire?Return with joy?And I, whom ye attended,Ye Muses and ye Graces,Whom all awaits that ye,Ye Muses and ye Graces,Of circling bliss in lifeHave glorified--shall IReturn dejected?
　　Father Bromius!Thourt the Genius,Genius of ages,Thou'rt what inward glowTo Pindar was,What to the worldPhoebus Apollo.
　　Woe! Woe Inward warmth,Spirit-warmth,Central-point!Glow, and vie withPhoebus Apollo!Coldly soonHis regal lookOver thee will swiftly glide,--
　　Envy-struckLinger o'er the cedar's strength,Which, to flourish,Waits him not.
　　Why doth my lay name thee the last?Thee, from whom it began,Thee, in whom it endeth,Thee, from whom it flows,Jupiter Pluvius!Tow'rd thee streams my song.And a Castalian springRuns as a fellow-brook,Runs to the idle ones,Mortal, happy ones,Apart from thee,Who cov'rest me around,Jupiter Pluvius!
　　Not by the elm-treeHim didst thou visit,With the pair of dovesHeld in his gentle arm,--With the beauteous garland of roses,--Caressing him, so blest in his flowers,Anacreon,Storm-breathing godhead!Not in the poplar grove,Near the Sybaris' strand,Not on the mountain'sSun-illumined browDidst thou seize him,The flower-singing,Honey-breathing,Sweetly noddingTheocritus.
　　When the wheels were rattling,Wheel on wheel tow'rd the goal,High aroseThe sound of the lashOf youths with victory glowing,In the dust rolling,As from the mountain fallShowers of stones in the vale--Then thy soul was brightly glowing, Pindar--Glowing? Poor heart!
　　There, on the hill,--Heavenly might!But enough glowThither to wend,Where is my cot!
　　1771.-----THE SEA-VOYAGE.
　　MANY a day and night my bark stood ready laden;Waiting fav'ring winds, I sat with true friends round me,Pledging me to patience and to courage,In the haven.
　　And they spoke thus with impatience twofold:"Gladly pray we for thy rapid passage,Gladly for thy happy voyage; fortuneIn the distant world is waiting for thee,In our arms thoult find thy prize, and love too,When returning."
　　And when morning came, arose an uproar,And the sailors' joyous shouts awoke us;All was stirring, all was living, moving,Bent on sailing with the first kind zephyr.
　　And the sails soon in the breeze are swelling,And the sun with fiery love invites us;Fill'd the sails are, clouds on high are floating,On the shore each friend exulting raisesSongs of hope, in giddy joy expectingJoy the voyage through, as on the morn of sailing,And the earliest starry nights so radiant.
　　But by God-sent changing winds ere long he's drivenSideways from the course he had intended,And he feigns as though he would surrender,While he gently striveth to outwit them,
　　To his goal, e'en when thus press'd, still faithful.But from out the damp grey distance rising,Softly now the storm proclaims its advent,Presseth down each bird upon the waters,Presseth down the throbbing hearts of mortals.And it cometh. At its stubborn fury,Wisely ev'ry sail the seaman striketh;With the anguish-laden ball are sportingWind and water.
　　And on yonder shore are gather'd standing,Friends and lovers, trembling for the bold one:"Why, alas, remain'd he here not with us!Ah, the tempest! Cast away by fortune!Must the good one perish in this fashion?Might not he perchance.... Ye great immortals!"
　　Yet he, like a man, stands by his rudder;With the bark are sporting wind and water,Wind and water sport not with his bosom:On the fierce deep looks he, as a master,--In his gods, or shipwreck'd, or safe landed,Trusting ever.
　　1776.-----THE EAGLE AND DOVE.
　　IN search of prey once raised his pinionsAn eaglet;A huntsman's arrow came, and reftHis right wing of all motive power.Headlong he fell into a myrtle grove,For three long days on anguish fed,In torment writhedThroughout three long, three weary nights;And then was cured,Thanks to all-healing Nature'sSoft, omnipresent balm.He crept away from out the copse,And stretch'd his wing--alas!Lost is all power of flight--He scarce can lift himselfFrom off the groundTo catch some mean, unworthy prey,And rests, deep-sorrowing,On the low rock beside the stream.Up to the oak he looks,Looks up to heaven,While in his noble eye there gleams a tear.Then, rustling through the myrtle boughs, behold,There comes a wanton pair of doves,Who settle down, and, nodding, strutO'er the gold sands beside the stream,And gradually approach;Their red-tinged eyes, so full of love,Soon see the inward-sorrowing one.The male, inquisitively social, leapsOn the next bush, and looksUpon him kindly and complacently."Thou sorrowest," murmurs he:"Be of good cheer, my friend!All that is needed for calm happinessHast thou not here?Hast thou not pleasure in the golden boughThat shields thee from the day's fierce glow?Canst thou not raise thy breast to catch,On the soft moss beside the brook,The sun's last rays at even?Here thou mayst wander through the flowers' fresh dew,Pluck from the overflowThe forest-trees provide,Thy choicest food,--mayst quenchThy light thirst at the silvery spring.Oh friend, true happinessLies in contentedness,And that contentednessFinds everywhere enough.""Oh, wise one!" said the eagle, while he sankIn deep and ever deep'ning thought--"Oh Wisdom! like a dove thou speakest!"
　　1774.*-----PROMETHEUS.
　　COVER thy spacious heavens, Zeus,With clouds of mist,And, like the boy who lopsThe thistles' heads,Disport with oaks and mountain-peaks,Yet thou must leaveMy earth still standing;My cottage too, which was not raised by thee;Leave me my hearth,Whose kindly glowBy thee is envied.
　　I know nought poorerUnder the sun, than ye gods!Ye nourish painfully,With sacrificesAnd votive prayers,Your majesty:Ye would e'en starve,If children and beggarsWere not trusting fools.
　　While yet a childAnd ignorant of life,I turned my wandering gazeUp tow'rd the sun, as if with himThere were an ear to hear my wailings,A heart, like mine,To feel compassion for distress.
　　Who help'd meAgainst the Titans' insolence?Who rescued me from certain death,From slavery?Didst thou not do all this thyself,My sacred glowing heart?And glowedst, young and good,Deceived with grateful thanksTo yonder slumbering one?
　　I honour thee! and why?Hast thou e'er lighten'd the sorrowsOf the heavy laden?Hast thou e'er dried up the tearsOf the anguish-stricken?Was I not fashion'd to be a manBy omnipotent Time,And by eternal Fate,Masters of me and thee?
　　Didst thou e'er fancyThat life I should learn to hate,And fly to deserts,Because not allMy blossoming dreams grew ripe?
　　Here sit I, forming mortalsAfter my image;A race resembling me,To suffer, to weep,To enjoy, to be glad,And thee to scorn,As I!
　　1773.-----GANYMEDE.
　　How, in the light of morning,Round me thou glowest,Spring, thou beloved one!With thousand-varying loving blissThe sacred emotionsBorn of thy warmth eternalPress 'gainst my bosom,Thou endlessly fair one!Could I but hold thee clasp'dWithin mine arms!
　　Ah! upon thy bosomLay I, pining,And then thy flowers, thy grass,Were pressing against my heart.Thou coolest the burningThirst of my bosom,Beauteous morning breeze!The nightingale then calls meSweetly from out of the misty vale.I come, I come!Whither? Ah, whither?
　　Up, up, lies my course.While downward the cloudsAre hovering, the cloudsAre bending to meet yearning love.For me,Within thine armsUpwards!Embraced and embracing!Upwards into thy bosom,Oh Father all-loving!
　　1789.*-----THE BOUNDARIES OF HUMANITY.
　　WHEN the primevalAll-holy FatherSows with a tranquil handFrom clouds, as they roll,Bliss-spreading lightningsOver the earth,Then do I kiss the lastHem of his garment,While by a childlike aweFiil'd is my breast.
　　For with immortalsNe'er may a mortalMeasure himself.If he soar upwardsAnd if he touchWith his forehead the stars,Nowhere will rest thenHis insecure feet,And with him sportTempest and cloud.
　　Though with firm sinewyLimbs he may standOn the enduringWell-grounded earth,All he is everAble to do,Is to resembleThe oak or the vine.
　　Wherein do godsDiffer from mortals?In that the formerSee endless billowsHeaving before them;Us doth the billowLift up and swallow,So that we perish.
　　Small is the ringEnclosing our life,And whole generationsLink themselves firmlyOn to existence'sChain never-ending.
　　1789. *-----THE GODLIKE.
　　NOBLE be man,Helpful and good!For that aloneDistinguisheth himFrom all the beingsUnto us known.
　　Hail to the beings,Unknown and glorious,Whom we forebode!From his exampleLearn we to know them!
　　For unfeelingNature is ever:On bad and on goodThe sun alike shineth;And on the wicked,As on the best,The moon and stars gleam.
　　Tempest and torrent,Thunder and hail,Roar on their path,Seizing the while,As they haste onward,One after another.
　　Even so, fortuneGropes 'mid the throng--Innocent boyhood'sCurly head seizing,--Seizing the hoaryHead of the sinner.
　　After laws mighty,Brazen, eternal,Must all we mortalsFinish the circuitOf our existence.
　　Man, and man onlyCan do the impossible;He 'tis distinguisheth,Chooseth and judgeth;He to the momentEndurance can lend.
　　He and he onlyThe good can reward,The bad can he punish,Can heal and can save;All that wanders and straysCan usefully blend.And we pay homageTo the immortalsAs though they were men,And did in the great,What the best, in the small,Does or might do.
　　Be the man that is noble,Both helpful and good.Unweariedly formingThe right and the useful,A type of those beingsOur mind hath foreshadow'd!

　　MISCELLANEOUS POEMS.
　　-----in the wares before you spread,Types of all things may be read.-----THE GERMAN PARNASSUS.
　　'NEATH the shadow
　　Of these bushes,On the meadow
　　Where the cooling water gushes.Phoebus gave me, when a boy,All life's fullness to enjoy.So, in silence, as the GodBade them with his sov'reign nod,Sacred Muses train'd my daysTo his praise.--With the bright and silv'ry floodOf Parnassus stirr'd my blood,And the seal so pure and chasteBy them on my lips was placed.
　　With her modest pinions, see,Philomel encircles me!In these bushes, in yon grove,
　　Calls she to her sister-throng,
　　And their heavenly choral songTeaches me to dream of love.
　　Fullness waxes in my breastOf emotions social, blest;Friendship's nurtured膌ove awakes,--And the silence Phoebus breaksOf his mountains, of his vales,Sweetly blow the balmy gales;All for whom he shows affection,Who are worthy his protection,Gladly follow his direction.
　　This one comes with joyous bearing
　　And with open, radiant gaze;That a sterner look is wearing,This one, scarcely cured, with daring
　　Wakes the strength of former days;For the sweet, destructive flamePierced his marrow and his frame.That which Amor stole beforePhoebus only can restore,Peace, and joy, and harmony,Aspirations pure and free.
　　Brethren, rise ye!Numbers prize ye!Deeds of worth resemble they.
　　Who can better than the bardGuide a friend when gone astray?
　　If his duty he regard,More he'll do, than others may.
　　Yes! afar I hear them sing!Yes! I hear them touch the string,And with mighty godlike stroke
　　Right and duty they inspire,And evoke,
　　As they sing, and wake the lyre,Tendencies of noblest worth,To each type of strength give birth.
　　Phantasies of sweetest powerFlowerRound about on ev'ry bough,Bending nowLike the magic wood of old,'Neath the fruit that gleams like gold.
　　What we feel and what we view
　　In the land of highest bliss,--
　　This dear soil, a sun like this,--Lures the best of women too.And the Muses' breathings blestRouse the maiden's gentle breast,Tune the throat to minstrelsy,And with cheeks of beauteous dye,Bid it sing a worthy song,Sit the sister-band among;And their strains grow softer still,As they vie with earnest will.
　　One amongst the band betimes
　　Goes to wanderBy the beeches, 'neath the limes,
　　Yonder seeking, finding yonderThat which in the morning-groveShe had lost through roguish Love,All her breast's first aspirations,And her heart's calm meditations,To the shady wood so fair
　　Gently stealing,Takes she that which man can ne'er
　　Duly merit,--each soft feeling,--Disregards the noontide rayAnd the dew at close of day,?
　　In the plain her path she loses.Ne'er disturb her on her way!
　　Seek her silently, ye Muses
　　Shouts I hear, wherein the soundOf the waterfall is drown'd.From the grove loud clamours rise,Strange the tumult, strange the cries.See I rightly? Can it be?To the very sanctuary,Lo, an impious troop in-hies!
　　O'er the landStreams the band;Hot desire,Drunken-fireIn their gazeWildly plays,--Makes their hairBristle there.And the troop,With fell swoop,Women, men,Coming then,Ply their blowsAnd expose,Void of shame,All the frame.Iron shot,Fierce and hot,Strike with fearOn the ear;All they slayOn their way.O'er the landPours the band;All take flightAt their sight.
　　Ah, o'er ev'ry plant they rush!Ah, their cruel footsteps crushAll the flowers that fill their path!Who will dare to stem their wrath?
　　Brethren, let us venture all!
　　Virtue in your pure cheek glows.Phoebus will attend our call
　　When he sees our heavy woes;And that we may have arightWeapons suited to the fight,He the mountain shaketh now--From its browRattling downStone on stoneThrough the thicket spread appear.Brethren, seize them! Wherefore fear?Now the villain crew assail,As though with a storm of hail,And expel the strangers wildFrom these regions soft and mildWhere the sun has ever smil'd!
　　What strange wonder do I see?Can it be?All my limbs of power are reft.And all strength my hand has left.Can it he?None are strangers that I see!And our brethren 'tis who goOn before, the way to show!Oh, the reckless impious ones!How they, with their jarring tones,Beat the time, as on they hie!Quick, my brethren!--let us fly!
　　To the rash ones, yet a word!Ay, my voice shall now be heard,As a peal of thunder, strong!
　　Words as poets' arms were made,--
　　When the god will he obey'd,Follow fast his darts ere long.
　　Was it possible that yeThus your godlike dignityShould forget? The Thyrsus rude
　　Must a heavy burden feel
　　To the hand but wont to stealO'er the lyre in gentle mood.From the sparkling waterfalls,From the brook that purling calls,Shall Silenus' loathsome beastBe allow'd at will to feast?Aganippe's * wave he sipsWith profane and spreading lips,--With ungainly feet stamps madly,Till the waters flow on sadly.
　　Fain I'd think myself deluded
　　In the sadd'ning sounds I hear;From the holy glades secluded
　　Hateful tones assail the ear.Laughter wild (exchange how mournful!)
　　Takes the place of love's sweet dream;Women-haters and the scornful
　　In exulting chorus scream.Nightingale and turtle dove
　　Fly their nests so warm and chaste,And, inflamed with sensual love,
　　Holds the Faun the Nymph embrac'd.Here a garment's torn away,
　　Scoffs succeed their sated bliss,While the god, with angry ray,
　　Looks upon each impious kiss.
　　Vapour, smoke, as from a fire,
　　And advancing clouds I view;Chords not only grace the lyre,
　　For the bow its chords bath too.Even the adorer's heart
　　Dreads the wild advancing hand,For the flames that round them dart
　　Show the fierce destroyer's hand.
　　Oh neglect not what I say,
　　For I speak it lovingly!From our boundaries haste away,
　　From the god's dread anger fly!Cleanse once more the holy place,
　　Turn the savage train aside!Earth contains upon its face
　　Many a spot unsanctified;Here we only prize the good.
　　Stars unsullied round us burn.
　　If ye, in repentant mood,
　　From your wanderings would return,--If ye fail to find the bliss
　　That ye found with us of yore,--Or when lawless mirth like this
　　Gives your hearts delight no more,--Then return in pilgrim guise,
　　Gladly up the mountain go,While your strains repentant rise,
　　And our brethren's advent show.
　　Let a new-born wreath entwine
　　Solemnly your temples round;Rapture glows in hearts divine
　　When a long-lost sinner's found.Swifter e'en than Lathe's flood
　　Round Death's silent house can play,Ev'ry error of the good
　　Will love's chalice wash away.All will haste your steps to meet,
　　As ye come in majesty,--Men your blessing will entreat;--
　　Ours ye thus will doubly be!
　　1798.(* Aganippe--A spring in Boeotia, which arose out of MountHelicon, and was sacred to Apollo and the Muses.)-----LILY'S MENAGERIE.
　　[Goethe describes this much-admired Poem, which he wrote inhonour of his love Lily, as being "designed to change hissurrender of her into despair, by drolly-fretful images."]
　　THERE'S no menagerie, I vow,
　　Excels my Lily's at this minute;
　　She keeps the strangest creatures in it,And catches them, she knows not how.
　　Oh, how they hop, and run, and rave,And their clipp'd pinions wildly wave,--Poor princes, who must all endureThe pangs of love that nought can cure.
　　What is the fairy's name?--Is't Lily?--Ask not me!Give thanks to Heaven if she's unknown to thee.
　　Oh what a cackling, what a shrieking,
　　When near the door she takes her stand,
　　With her food-basket in her hand!Oh what a croaking, what a squeaking!Alive all the trees and the bushes appear,While to her feet whole troops draw near;The very fish within, the water clearSplash with impatience and their heads protrude;And then she throws around the foodWith such a look!--the very gods delighting(To say nought of beasts). There begins, then, a biting,A picking, a pecking, a sipping,And each o'er the legs of another is tripping,And pushing, and pressing, and flapping,And chasing, and fuming, and snapping,And all for one small piece of bread,To which, though dry, her fair hands give a taste,As though it in ambrosia had been plac'd.
　　And then her look! the tone
　　With which she calls: Pipi! Pipi!Would draw Jove's eagle from his throne;Yes, Venus' turtle doves, I wean,And the vain peacock e'en,Would come, I swear,Soon as that tone had reach'd them through the air.
　　E'en from a forest dark had she
　　Enticed a bear, unlick'd, ill-bred,
　　And, by her wiles alluring, ledTo join the gentle company,Until as tame as they was he:(Up to a certain point, be't understood!)How fair, and, ah, how goodShe seem'd to be! I would have drain'd my bloodTo water e'en her flow'rets sweet.
　　"Thou sayest: I! Who? How? And where?"--Well, to be plain, good Sirs--I am the bear;
　　In a net-apron, caught, alas!
　　Chain'd by a silk-thread at her feet.
　　But how this wonder came to passI'll tell some day, if ye are curious;Just now, my temper's much too furious.
　　Ah, when I'm in the corner plac'd,
　　And hear afar the creatures snapping,
　　And see the flipping and the flapping,
　　I turn around
　　With growling sound,
　　And backward run a step in haste,
　　And look around
　　With growling sound.
　　Then run again a step in haste,And to my former post go round.
　　But suddenly my anger grows,A mighty spirit fills my nose,My inward feelings all revolt.A creature such as thou! a dolt!Pipi, a squirrel able nuts to crack!I bristle up my shaggy backUnused a slave to be.I'm laughed at by each trim and upstart treeTo scorn. The bowling-green I fly,
　　With neatly-mown and well-kept grass:
　　The box makes faces as I pass,--Into the darkest thicket hasten I,Hoping to 'scape from the ring,Over the palings to spring!Vainly I leap and climb;
　　I feel a leaden spell.
　　That pinions me as well,And when I'm fully wearied out in time,I lay me down beside some mock-cascade,
　　And roll myself half dead, and foam, and cry,
　　And, ah! no Oreads hear my sigh,Excepting those of china made!
　　But, ah, with sudden power
　　In all my members blissful feelings reign!'Tis she who singeth yonder in her bower!
　　I hear that darling, darling voice again.The air is warm, and teems with fragrance clear,Sings she perchance for me alone to hear?
　　I haste, and trample down the shrubs amain;The trees make way, the bushes all retreat,And so--the beast is lying at her feet.
　　She looks at him: "The monster's droll enough!
　　He's, for a bear, too mild,
　　Yet, for a dog, too wild,So shaggy, clumsy, rough!"Upon his back she gently strokes her foot;
　　He thinks himself in Paradise.What feelings through his seven senses shoot!
　　But she looks on with careless eyes.I lick her soles, and kiss her shoes,
　　As gently as a bear well may;Softly I rise, and with a clever ruse
　　Leap on her knee.--On a propitious dayShe suffers it; my ears then tickles she,
　　And hits me a hard blow in wanton play;I growl with new-born ecstasy;Then speaks she in a sweet vain jest, I wot"Allons lout doux! eh! la menotte!Et faites serviteurComme un joli seigneur."Thus she proceeds with sport and glee;
　　Hope fills the oft-deluded beast;Yet if one moment he would lazy be,
　　Her fondness all at once hath ceas'd.
　　She doth a flask of balsam-fire possess,
　　Sweeter than honey bees can make,
　　One drop of which she'll on her finger take,When soften'd by his love and faithfulness,
　　Wherewith her monster's raging thirst to slake;Then leaves me to myself, and flies at last,And I, unbound, yet prison'd fastBy magic, follow in her train,Seek for her, tremble, fly again.The hapless creature thus tormenteth she,
　　Regardless of his pleasure or his woe;Ha! oft half-open'd does she leave the door for me,
　　And sideways looks to learn if I will fly or no.And I--Oh gods! your hands aloneCan end the spell that's o'er me thrown;Free me, and gratitude my heart will fill;
　　And yet from heaven ye send me down no aid--
　　Not quite in vain doth life my limbs pervade:I feel it! Strength is left me still.
　　1775.-----TO CHARLOTTE.
　　'MIDST the noise of merriment and glee,
　　'Midst full many a sorrow, many a care,Charlotte, I remember, we remember thee,
　　How, at evening's hour so fair,Thou a kindly hand didst reach us,
　　When thou, in some happy place
　　Where more fair is Nature s face,
　　Many a lightly-hidden traceOf a spirit loved didst teach us.
　　Well 'tis that thy worth I rightly knew,--
　　That I, in the hour when first we met,
　　While the first impression fill'd me yet,Call'd thee then a girl both good and true.
　　Rear'd in silence, calmly, knowing nought,
　　On the world we suddenly are thrown;Hundred thousand billows round us sport;
　　All things charm us--many please alone,Many grieve us, and as hour on hour is stealing,
　　To and fro our restless natures sway;First we feel, and then we find each feeling
　　By the changeful world-stream borne away.
　　Well I know, we oft within us find
　　Many a hope and many a smart.Charlotte, who can know our mind?
　　Charlotte, who can know our heart?Ah! 'twould fain be understood, 'twould fain o'erflow
　　In some creature's fellow-feelings blest,And, with trust, in twofold measure know
　　All the grief and joy in Nature's breast.
　　Then thine eye is oft around thee cast,
　　But in vain, for all seems closed for ever.Thus the fairest part of life is madly pass'd
　　Free from storm, but resting never:To thy sorrow thou'rt to-day repell'd
　　By what yesterday obey'd thee.Can that world by thee be worthy held
　　Which so oft betray'd thee?
　　Which, 'mid all thy pleasures and thy pains,
　　Lived in selfish, unconcern'd repose?See, the soul its secret cells regains,
　　And the heart--makes haste to close.Thus found I thee, and gladly went to meet thee;
　　"She's worthy of all love!" I cried,And pray'd that Heaven with purest bliss might greet thee,
　　Which in thy friend it richly hath supplied.
　　1776.*-----LOVE'S DISTRESSES.
　　WHO will hear me? Whom shall I lament to?Who would pity me that heard my sorrows?Ah, the lip that erst so many rapturesUsed to taste, and used to give responsive,Now is cloven, and it pains me sorely;And it is not thus severely woundedBy my mistress having caught me fiercely,And then gently bitten me, intendingTo secure her friend more firmly to her:No, my tender lip is crack'd thus, onlyBy the winds, o'er rime and frost proceeding,Pointed, sharp, unloving, having met me.Now the noble grape's bright juice commingledWith the bee's sweet juice, upon the fireOf my hearth, shall ease me of my torment.Ah, what use will all this be, if with itLove adds not a drop of his own balsam?
　　1789.*-----THE MUSAGETES.
　　IN the deepest nights of WinterTo the Muses kind oft cried I:"Not a ray of morn is gleaming,Not a sign of daylight breaking;Bring, then, at the fitting moment,Bring the lamp's soft glimm'ring lustre,'Stead of Phoebus and Aurora,To enliven my still labours!"Yet they left me in my slumbers,Dull and unrefreshing, lying,And to each late-waken'd morningFollow'd days devoid of profit.
　　When at length return'd the spring-time,To the nightingales thus spake I:"Darling nightingales, oh, beat yeEarly, early at my window,--Wake me from the heavy slumberThat chains down the youth so strongly!"Yet the love-o'erflowing songstersTheir sweet melodies protractedThrough the night before my window,Kept awake my loving spirit,Rousing new and tender yearningsIn my newly-waken'd bosom.And the night thus fleeted o'er me,And Aurora found me sleeping,--Ay, the sun could scarce arouse me.
　　Now at length is come the Summer,And the early fly so busyDraws me from my pleasing slumbersAt the first-born morning-glimmer.Mercilessly then returns she,Though the half-aroused one oftenScares her from him with impatience,And she lures her shameless sisters,So that from my weary eyelidsKindly sleep ere long is driven.From my couch then boldly spring I,And I seek the darling Muses,in the beechen-grove I find them,Full of pieasure to receive me;And to the tormenting insectsOwe I many a golden hour.Thus be ye, unwelcome beings,Highly valued by the poet,As the flies my numbers tell of.
　　1798.-----MORNING LAMENT.
　　OH thou cruel deadly-lovely maiden,Tell me what great sin have I committed,That thou keep'st me to the rack thus fasten'd,That thou hast thy solemn promise broken?
　　'Twas but yestere'en that thou with fondnessPress'd my hand, and these sweet accents murmured:"Yes, I'll come, I'll come when morn approacheth,Come, my friend, full surely to thy chamber."
　　On the latch I left my doors, unfasten'd,Having first with care tried all the hinges,And rejoic'd right well to find they creak'd not.
　　What a night of expectation pass'd I!For I watch'd, and ev'ry chime I number'd;If perchance I slept a few short moments,Still my heart remain'd awake forever,And awoke me from my gentle slumbers.
　　Yes, then bless'd I night's o'erhanging darkness,That so calmly cover'd all things round me;I enjoy'd the universal silence,While I listen'd ever in the silence,If perchance the slightest sounds were stirring.
　　"Had she only thoughts, my thoughts resembling,Had she only feelings, like my feelings,She would not await the dawn of morning.But, ere this, would surely have been with me."
　　Skipp'd a kitten on the floor above me,Scratch'd a mouse a panel in the corner,Was there in the house the slightest motion,Ever hoped I that I heard thy footstep,Ever thought I that I heard thee coming.And so lay I long, and ever longer,And already was the daylight dawning,And both here and there were signs of movement.
　　"Is it yon door? Were it my door only!"In my bed I lean'd upon my elbow,Looking tow'rd the door, now half-apparent,If perchance it might not be in motion.Both the wings upon the latch continued,On the quiet hinges calmly hanging.
　　And the day grew bright and brighter ever;And I heard my neighbour's door unbolted,As he went to earn his daily wages,And ere long I heard the waggons rumbling,And the city gates were also open'd,While the market-place, in ev'ry corner,Teem'd with life and bustle and confusion.
　　In the house was going now and comingUp and down the stairs, and doors were creakingBackwards now, now forwards,--footsteps clatter'dYet, as though it were a thing all-living,From my cherish'd hope I could not tear me.
　　When at length the sun, in hated splendour.Fell upon my walls, upon my windows,Up I sprang, and hasten'd to the garden,There to blend my breath, so hot and yearning,With the cool refreshing morning breezes,And, it might be, even there to meet thee:But I cannot find thee in the arbour,Or the avenue of lofty lindens.
　　1789.*-----THE VISIT.
　　FAIN had I to-day surprised my mistress,But soon found I that her door was fasten'd.Yet I had the key safe in my pocket,And the darling door I open'd softly!In the parlour found I not the maiden,Found the maiden not within her closet,Then her chamber-door I gently open'd,When I found her wrapp'd in pleasing slumbers,Fully dress'd, and lying on the sofa.
　　While at work had slumber stolen o'er her;For her knitting and her needle found IResting in her folded bands so tender;And I placed myself beside her softly,And held counsel, whether I should wake her.
　　Then I looked upon the beauteous quietThat on her sweet eyelids was reposingOn her lips was silent truth depicted,On her cheeks had loveliness its dwelling,And the pureness of a heart unsulliedIn her bosom evermore was heaving.All her limbs were gracefully reclining,Set at rest by sweet and godlike balsam.Gladly sat I, and the contemplationHeld the strong desire I felt to wake herFirmer and firmer down, with mystic fetters.
　　"Oh, thou love," methought, "I see that slumber,Slumber that betrayeth each false feature,Cannot injure thee, can nought discoverThat could serve to harm thy friend's soft feelings.
　　"Now thy beauteous eyes are firmly closed,That, when open, form mine only rapture.And thy sweet lips are devoid of motion,Motionless for speaking or for kissing;Loosen'd are the soft and magic fettersOf thine arms, so wont to twine around me,And the hand, the ravishing companionOf thy sweet caresses, lies unmoving.Were my thoughts of thee but based on error,Were the love I bear thee self-deception,I must now have found it out, since AmorIs, without his bandage, placed beside me."
　　Long I sat thus, full of heartfelt pleasureAt my love, and at her matchless merit;She had so delighted me while slumbering,That I could not venture to awake her.
　　Then I on the little table near herSoftly placed two oranges, two roses;Gently, gently stole I from her chamber.When her eyes the darling one shall open,She will straightway spy these colourd presents,And the friendly gift will view with wonder,For the door will still remain unopen'd.
　　If perchance I see to-night the angel,How will she rejoice,--reward me doublyFor this sacrifice of fond affection!
　　1765.-----THE MAGIC NET.
　　Do I see a contest yonder?See I miracles or pastimes?Beauteous urchins, five in number,'Gainst five sisters fair contending,--Measured is the time they're beating--At a bright enchantress' bidding.Glitt'ring spears by some are wielded,Threads are others nimbly twining,
　　So that in their snares, the weaponsOne would think, must needs be captured,Soon, in truth, the spears are prison'd;Yet they, in the gentle war-dance,One by one escape their fettersIn the row of loops so tender,That make haste to seize a free oneSoon as they release a captive.
　　So with contests, strivings, triumphs,Flying now, and now returning,Is an artful net soon woven,In its whiteness like the snow-flakes,That, from light amid the darkness,Draw their streaky lines so varied,As e'en colours scarce can draw them.
　　Who shall now receive that garmentFar beyond all others wish'd-for?Whom our much-loved mistress favourAs her own acknowledged servant?I am blest by kindly Fortune'sTokens true, in silence pray'd for!And I feel myself held captive,To her service now devoted.
　　Yet, e'en while I, thus enraptured,Thus adorn'd, am proudly wand'ring,See! yon wantons are entwining,Void of strife, with secret ardour,Other nets, each fine and finer,Threads of twilight interweaving,Moonbeams sweet, night-violets' balsam.
　　Ere the net is noticed by us,Is a happier one imprison'd,Whom we, one and all, togetherGreet with envy and with blessings.
　　1803.-----THE GOBLET.
　　ONCE I held a well-carved brimming goblet,--In my two hands tightly clasp'd I held it,Eagerly the sweet wine sipp'd I from it,Seeking there to drown all care and sorrow.
　　Amor enter'd in, and found me sitting,And he gently smiled in modest fashion,Smiled as though the foolish one he pitied.
　　"Friend, I know a far more beauteous vessel,One wherein to sink thy spirit wholly;Say, what wilt thou give me, if I grant it,And with other nectar fill it for thee?"
　　Oh, how kindly hath he kept his promise!For to me, who long had yearn'd, he grantedThee, my Lida, fill'd with soft affection.
　　When I clasp mine arms around thee fondly,When I drink in love's long-hoarded balsamFrom thy darling lips so true, so faithful,Fill'd with bliss thus speak I to my spirit"No! a vessel such as this, save AmorNever god hath fashion'd or been lord of!Such a form was ne'er produced by VulcanWith his cunning, reason-gifted hammers!On the leaf-crown'd mountains may LyaeusBid his Fauns, the oldest and the wisest,Pass the choicest clusters through the winepress,And himself watch o'er the fermentation:Such a draught no toil can e'er procure him!"
　　1781.-----TO THE GRASSHOPPER.
　　AFTER ANACREON.
　　[The strong resemblance of this fine poem to Cowley's Ode bearingthe same name, and beginning "Happy insect! what can be," will beat once seen.]
　　HAPPY art thou, darling insect,Who, upon the trees' tall branches,By a modest draught inspired,Singing, like a monarch livest!Thou possessest as thy portionAll that on the plains thou seest,All that by the hours is brought thee'Mongst the husbandmen thou livest,As a friend, uninjured by them,Thou whom mortals love to honour,Herald sweet of sweet Spring's advent!Yes, thou'rt loved by all the Muses,
　　Phoebus' self, too, needs must love thee;They their silver voices gave thee,Age can never steal upon thee.Wise and gentle friend of poets,Born a creature fleshless, bloodless,Though Earth's daughter, free from suff'ring,To the gods e'en almost equal.
　　1781.-----FROM 'THE SORROWS OF YOUNG WERTHER.'
　　[Prefixed to the second edition.]
　　EV'RY youth for love's sweet portion sighs,
　　Ev'ry maiden sighs to win man's love;Why, alas! should bitter pain arise
　　From the noblest passion that we prove?
　　Thou, kind soul, bewailest, lov'st him well,
　　From disgrace his memory's saved by thee;Lo, his spirit signs from out its cell:
　　BE A MAN, NOR SEEK TO FOLLOW ME.
　　1775.-----TRILOGY OF PASSION.
　　I. TO WERTHER.
　　[This poem, written at the age of seventy-five, was appended toan edition of 'Werther,' published at that time.]
　　ONCE more, then, much-wept shadow, thou dost dare
　　Boldly to face the day's clear light,To meet me on fresh blooming meadows fair,
　　And dost not tremble at my sight.Those happy times appear return'd once more.
　　When on one field we quaff'd refreshing dew,And, when the day's unwelcome toils were o'er,
　　The farewell sunbeams bless'd our ravish'd view;Fate bade thee go,--to linger here was mine,--Going the first, the smaller loss was thine.
　　The life of man appears a glorious fate:The day how lovely, and the night how great!And we 'mid Paradise-like raptures plac'd,The sun's bright glory scarce have learn'd to taste.
　　When strange contending feelings dimly cover,Now us, and now the forms that round us hover;One's feelings by no other are supplied,'Tis dark without, if all is bright inside;An outward brightness veils my sadden'd mood,When Fortune smiles,--how seldom understood!Now think we that we know her, and with mightA woman's beauteous form instils delight;The youth, as glad as in his infancy,The spring-time treads, as though the spring were heRavish'd, amazed, he asks, how this is done?He looks around, the world appears his own.With careless speed he wanders on through space,Nor walls, nor palaces can check his race;As some gay flight of birds round tree-tops plays,So 'tis with him who round his mistress strays;He seeks from AEther, which he'd leave behind him,The faithful look that fondly serves to bind him.
　　Yet first too early warn'd, and then too late,He feels his flight restrain'd, is captur'd straightTo meet again is sweet, to part is sad,Again to meet again is still more glad,And years in one short moment are enshrin'd;But, oh, the harsh farewell is hid behind!
　　Thou smilest, friend, with fitting thoughts inspired;By a dread parting was thy fame acquired,Thy mournful destiny we sorrow'd o'er,For weal and woe thou left'st us evermore,And then again the passions' wavering forceDrew us along in labyrinthine course;And we, consumed by constant misery,At length must part--and parting is to die!How moving is it, when the minstrel sings,To 'scape the death that separation brings!Oh grant, some god, to one who suffers so,To tell, half-guilty, his sad tale of woe
　　1824
　　II. ELEGY.
　　When man had ceased to utter his lament,
　　A god then let me tell my tale of sorrow.
　　WHAT hope of once more meeting is there nowIn the still-closed blossoms of this day?Both heaven and hell thrown open seest thou;What wav'ring thoughts within the bosom playNo longer doubt! Descending from the sky,She lifts thee in her arms to realms on high.
　　And thus thou into Paradise wert brought,
　　As worthy of a pure and endless life;Nothing was left, no wish, no hope, no thought,
　　Here was the boundary of thine inmost strife:And seeing one so fair, so glorified,The fount of yearning tears was straightway dried.
　　No motion stirr'd the day's revolving wheel,
　　In their own front the minutes seem'd to go;The evening kiss, a true and binding seal,
　　Ne'er changing till the morrow's sunlight glow.The hours resembled sisters as they went.Yet each one from another different.
　　The last hour's kiss, so sadly sweet, effac'd
　　A beauteous network of entwining love.Now on the threshold pause the feet, now haste.
　　As though a flaming cherub bade them move;The unwilling eye the dark road wanders o'er,Backward it looks, but closed it sees the door.
　　And now within itself is closed this breast,
　　As though it ne'er were open, and as though,Vying with ev'ry star, no moments blest
　　Had, in its presence, felt a kindling glow;Sadness, reproach, repentance, weight of care,Hang heavy on it in the sultry air.
　　Is not the world still left? The rocky steeps,
　　Are they with holy shades no longer crown'd?Grows not the harvest ripe? No longer creeps
　　The espalier by the stream,--the copse around?Doth not the wondrous arch of heaven still rise,Now rich in shape, now shapeless to the eyes?
　　As, seraph-like, from out the dark clouds' chorus,
　　With softness woven, graceful, light, and fair,Resembling Her, in the blue aether o'er us,
　　A slender figure hovers in the air,--Thus didst thou see her joyously advance,The fairest of the fairest in the dance.
　　Yet but a moment dost thou boldly dare
　　To clasp an airy form instead of hers;Back to thine heart! thou'lt find it better there,
　　For there in changeful guise her image stirsWhat erst was one, to many turneth fast,In thousand forms, each dearer than the last.
　　As at the door, on meeting lingerd she,
　　And step by step my faithful ardour bless'd,For the last kiss herself entreated me,
　　And on my lips the last last kiss impress'd,--Thus clearly traced, the lov'd one's form we view,With flames engraven on a heart so true,--
　　A heart that, firm as some embattled tower,
　　Itself for her, her in itself reveres,For her rejoices in its lasting power,
　　Conscious alone, when she herself appears;Feels itself freer in so sweet a thrall,And only beats to give her thanks in all.
　　The power of loving, and all yearning sighs
　　For love responsive were effaced and drown'd;While longing hope for joyous enterprise
　　Was form'd, and rapid action straightway found;If love can e'er a loving one inspire,Most lovingly it gave me now its fire;
　　And 'twas through her!--an inward sorrow lay
　　On soul and body, heavily oppress'd;To mournful phantoms was my sight a prey,
　　In the drear void of a sad tortured breast;Now on the well-known threshold Hope hath smil'd,Herself appeareth in the sunlight mild.
　　Unto the peace of God, which, as we read,
　　Blesseth us more than reason e'er bath done,Love's happy peace would I compare indeed,
　　When in the presence of the dearest one.There rests the heart, and there that sweetest thought,The thought of being hers, is check'd by nought.
　　In the pure bosom doth a yearning float,
　　Unto a holier, purer, unknown BeingIts grateful aspiration to devote,
　　The Ever-Nameless then unriddled seeing;We call it: piety!--such blest delightI feel a share in, when before her sight.
　　Before her sight, as 'neath the sun's hot ray,
　　Before her breath, as 'neath the spring's soft wind,In its deep wintry cavern melts away
　　Self-love, so long in icy chains confin'd;No selfishness and no self-will are nigh,For at her advent they were forced to fly.
　　It seems as though she said: "As hours pass by
　　They spread before us life with kindly plan;Small knowledge did the yesterday supply,
　　To know the morrow is conceal'd from man;And if the thought of evening made me start,The sun at setting gladden'd straight my heart.
　　"Act, then, as I, and look, with joyous mind,
　　The moment in the face; nor linger thou!Meet it with speed, so fraught with life, so kind
　　In action, and in love so radiant now;Let all things be where thou art, childlike ever,Thus thoult be all, thus, thou'lt be vanquish'd never."
　　Thou speakest well, methought, for as thy guide
　　The moment's favour did a god assign,And each one feels himself when by thy side,
　　Fate's fav'rite in a moment so divine;I tremble at thy look that bids me go,Why should I care such wisdom vast to know?
　　Now am I far! And what would best befit
　　The present minute? I could scarcely tell;Full many a rich possession offers it,
　　These but offend, and I would fain repel.Yearnings unquenchable still drive me on,All counsel, save unbounded tears, is gone.
　　Flow on, flow on in never-ceasing course,
　　Yet may ye never quench my inward fire!Within my bosom heaves a mighty force,
　　Where death and life contend in combat dire.Medicines may serve the body's pangs to still;Nought but the spirit fails in strength of will,--
　　Fails in conception; wherefore fails it so?
　　A thousand times her image it portrays;Enchanting now, and now compell'd to go,
　　Now indistinct, now clothed in purest rays!How could the smallest comfort here be flowing?The ebb and flood, the coming and the going!
　　*      *      *      *      *      *
　　Leave me here now, my life's companions true!
　　Leave me alone on rock, in moor and heath;But courage! open lies the world to you,
　　The glorious heavens above, the earth beneath;Observe, investigate, with searching eyes,And nature will disclose her mysteries.
　　To me is all, I to myself am lost,
　　Who the immortals' fav'rite erst was thought;They, tempting, sent Pandoras to my cost,
　　So rich in wealth, with danger far more fraught;They urged me to those lips, with rapture crown'd,Deserted me, and hurl'd me to the ground.
　　1823.
　　III.  ATONEMENT.
　　[Composed, when 74 years old, for a Polish lady, who excelled inplaying on the pianoforte.]
　　PASSION brings reason--who can pacify
　　An anguish'd heart whose loss hath been so great?Where are the hours that fled so swiftly by?
　　In vain the fairest thou didst gain from fate;Sad is the soul, confused the enterprise;
　　The glorious world, how on the sense it dies!
　　In million tones entwined for evermore,
　　Music with angel-pinions hovers there,To pierce man's being to its inmost core,
　　Eternal beauty has its fruit to bear;The eye grows moist, in yearnings blest reveresThe godlike worth of music as of tears.
　　And so the lighten'd heart soon learns to see
　　That it still lives, and beats, and ought to beat,Off'ring itself with joy and willingly,
　　In grateful payment for a gift so sweet.And then was felt,--oh may it constant prove!--The twofold bliss of music and of love.
　　1823.-----
　　THE remembrance of the GoodKeep us ever glad in mood.
　　The remembrance of the FairMakes a mortal rapture share.
　　The remembrance of one's LoveBlest Is, if it constant prove.
　　The remembrance of the OneIs the greatest joy that's known.
　　1828.-----[Written at the age of 77.]
　　WHEN I was still a youthful wight,
　　So full of enjoyment and merry,The painters used to assert, in spite,
　　That my features were small--yes, very;Yet then full many a beauteous childWith true affection upon me smil'd.
　　Now as a greybeard I sit here in state,
　　By street and by lane held in awe, sirs;And may be seen, like old Frederick the Great,
　　On pipebowls, on cups, and on saucers.Yet the beauteous maidens, they keep afar;Oh vision of youth! Oh golden star!
　　1826.-----FOR EVER.
　　THE happiness that man, whilst prison'd here,
　　Is wont with heavenly rapture to compare,--The harmony of Truth, from wavering clear,--
　　Of Friendship that is free from doubting care,--The light which in stray thoughts alone can cheer
　　The wise,--the bard alone in visions fair,--In my best hours I found in her all this,And made mine own, to mine exceeding bliss.
　　1820.*-----FROM AN ALBUM OF 1604.
　　HOPE provides wings to thought, and love to hope.Rise up to Cynthia, love, when night is clearest,And say, that as on high her figure changeth,So, upon earth, my joy decays and grows.And whisper in her ear with modest softness,How doubt oft hung its head, and truth oft wept.And oh ye thoughts, distrustfully inclined,If ye are therefore by the loved one chided,Answer: 'tis true ye change, but alter not,As she remains the same, yet changeth ever.Doubt may invade the heart, but poisons not,For love is sweeter, by suspicion flavour'd.If it with anger overcasts the eye,And heaven's bright purity perversely blackens,Then zephyr-sighs straight scare the clouds away,And, changed to tears, dissolve them into rain.Thought, hope, and love remain there as before,Till Cynthia gleams upon me as of old.
　　1820.*-----LINES ON SEEING SCHILLER'S SKULL.
　　[This curious imitation of the ternary metre of Dante was writtenat the age of 77.]
　　WITHIN a gloomy charnel-house one day
　　I view'd the countless skulls, so strangely mated,And of old times I thought, that now were grey.
　　Close pack'd they stand, that once so fiercely hated,And hardy bones, that to the death contended,
　　Are lying cross'd,--to lie for ever, fated.What held those crooked shoulder-blades suspended?
　　No one now asks; and limbs with vigour fired,The hand, the foot--their use in life is ended.
　　Vainly ye sought the tomb for rest when tired;Peace in the grave may not be yours; ye're driven
　　Back into daylight by a force inspired;But none can love the wither'd husk, though even
　　A glorious noble kernel it contained.To me, an adept, was the writing given
　　Which not to all its holy sense explained,When 'mid the crowd, their icy shadows flinging,
　　I saw a form, that glorious still remained.And even there, where mould and damp were clinging,
　　Gave me a blest, a rapture-fraught emotion,As though from death a living fount were springing.
　　What mystic joy I felt! What rapt devotion!That form, how pregnant with a godlike trace!
　　A look, how did it whirl me tow'rd that oceanWhose rolling billows mightier shapes embrace!
　　Mysterious vessel! Oracle how dear!Even to grasp thee is my hand too base,
　　Except to steal thee from thy prison hereWith pious purpose, and devoutly go
　　Back to the air, free thoughts, and sunlight clear.What greater gain in life can man e'er know
　　Than when God-Nature will to him explainHow into Spirit steadfastness may flow,
　　How steadfast, too, the Spirit-Born remain.
　　1826.-----ROYAL PRAYER.
　　HA, I am the lord of earth! The noble,
　　Who're in my service, love me.Ha, I am the lord of earth! The noble,
　　O'er whom my sway extendeth, love I.Oh, grant me, God in Heaven, that I may ne'er
　　Dispense with loftiness and love!
　　1815.*-----HUMAN FEELINGS.
　　AH, ye gods! ye great immortalsIn the spacious heavens above us!Would ye on this earth but give usSteadfast minds and dauntless courageWe, oh kindly ones, would leave youAll your spacious heavens above us!
　　1815.*-----ON THE DIVAN.
　　HE who knows himself and others
　　Here will also see,That the East and West, like brothers,
　　Parted ne'er shall be.
　　Thoughtfully to float for ever
　　'Tween two worlds, be man's endeavour!So between the East and West
　　To revolve, be my behest!
　　1833.*-----EXPLANATION  OF AN ANCIENT WOODCUT, REPRESENTINGHANS SACHS' POETICAL MISSION.
　　[I feel considerable hesitation in venturing to offer thisversion of a poem which Carlyle describes to be 'a beautifulpiece (a very Hans Sacks beatified, both in character and style),which we wish there was any possibility of translating.' Thereader will be aware that Hans Sachs was the celebrated Minstrel-Cobbler of Nuremberg, who Wrote 208 plays, 1700 comic tales, andbetween 4000 and 5000 lyric poems. He flourished throughoutalmost the whole of the 16th century.]
　　EARLY within his workshop here,On Sundays stands our master dear;His dirty apron he puts away,And wears a cleanly doublet to-day;Lets wax'd thread, hammer, and pincers rest,And lays his awl within his chest;The seventh day he takes reposeFrom many pulls and many blows.
　　Soon as the spring-sun meets his view,Repose begets him labour anew;He feels that he holds within his brainA little world, that broods there amain,And that begins to act and to live,Which he to others would gladly give.
　　He had a skilful eye and true,And was full kind and loving too.For contemplation, clear and pure,--For making all his own again, sure;He had a tongue that charm'd when 'twas heard,And graceful and light flow'd ev'ry word;Which made the Muses in him rejoice,The Master-singer of their choice.
　　And now a maiden enter'd there,With swelling breast, and body fair;With footing firm she took her place,And moved with stately, noble grace;She did not walk in wanton mood,Nor look around with glances lewd.
　　She held a measure in her hand,Her girdle was a golden band,A wreath of corn was on her head,Her eye the day's bright lustre shed;Her name is honest Industry,Else, Justice, Magnanimity.
　　She enter'd with a kindly greeting;He felt no wonder at the meeting,For, kind and fair as she might be,He long had known her, fancied he.
　　"I have selected thee," she said,"From all who earth's wild mazes tread,That thou shouldst have clear-sighted sense,And nought that's wrong shouldst e'er commence.When others run in strange confusion,Thy gaze shall see through each illusionWhen others dolefully complain,Thy cause with jesting thou shalt gain,Honour and right shalt value duly,In everything act simply, truly,--Virtue and godliness proclaim,And call all evil by its name,Nought soften down, attempt no quibble,Nought polish up, nought vainly scribble.The world shall stand before thee, then,As seen by Albert Durer's ken,In manliness and changeless life,In inward strength, with firmness rife.Fair Nature's Genius by the handShall lead thee on through every land,Teach thee each different life to scan,Show thee the wondrous ways of man,His shifts, confusions, thrustings, and drubbings,Pushings, tearings, pressings, and rubbings;The varying madness of the crew,The anthill's ravings bring to view;But thou shalt see all this express'd,As though 'twere in a magic chest.Write these things down for folks on earth,In hopes they may to wit give birth."--Then she a window open'd wide,And show'd a motley crowd outside,All kinds of beings 'neath the sky,As in his writings one may spy.
　　Our master dear was, after this,On Nature thinking, full of bliss,When tow'rd him, from the other sideHe saw an aged woman glide;The name she bears, Historia,Mythologia, Fabula;With footstep tottering and unstableShe dragg'd a large and wooden carved-table,Where, with wide sleeves and human mien,The Lord was catechizing seen;Adam, Eve, Eden, the Serpent's seduction,Gomorrah and Sodom's awful destruction,The twelve illustrious women, too,That mirror of honour brought to view;All kinds of bloodthirstiness, murder, and sin,The twelve wicked tyrants also were in,And all kinds of goodly doctrine and law;Saint Peter with his scourge you saw,With the world's ways dissatisfied,And by our Lord with power supplied.Her train and dress, behind and before,And e'en the seams, were painted o'erWith tales of worldly virtue and crime.--Our master view'd all this for a time;The sight right gladly he survey'd,So useful for him in his trade,Whence he was able to procureExample good and precept sure,Recounting all with truthful care,As though he had been present there.His spirit seem'd from earth to fly,He ne'er had turned away his eye,Did he not just behind him hearA rattle of bells approaching near.And now a fool doth catch his eye,With goat and ape's leap drawing nighA merry interlude preparingWith fooleries and jests unsparing.Behind him, in a line drawn out,He dragg'd all fools, the lean and stout,The great and little, the empty and full,All too witty, and all too dull,A lash he flourish'd overhead,As though a dance of apes he led,Abusing them with bitterness,As though his wrath would ne'er grow less.
　　While on this sight our master gazed,His head was growing well-nigh crazed:What words for all could he e'er find,Could such a medley be combined?Could he continue with delightFor evermore to sing and write?When lo, from out a cloud's dark bedIn at the upper window spedThe Muse, in all her majesty,As fair as our loved maids we see.With clearness she around him threwHer truth, that ever stronger grew.
　　"I, to ordain thee come," she spake:"So prosper, and my blessing take!The holy fire that slumb'ring liesWithin thee, in bright flames shall rise;Yet that thine ever-restless lifeMay still with kindly strength be rife,I, for thine inward spirit's calm.Have granted nourishment and balm,That rapture may thy soul imbue,Like some fair blossom bathed in dew."--Behind his house then secretlyOutside the doorway pointed she,Where, in a shady garden-nook,A beauteous maid with downcast lookWas sitting where a stream was flowing,With elder bushes near it growing,She sat beneath an apple tree,And nought around her seem'd to see.Her lap was full of roses fair,Which in a wreath she twined with care.And, with them, leaves and blossoms blended:For whom was that sweet wreath intended?Thus sat she, modest and retired,Her bosom throbb'd, with hope inspired;Such deep forebodings fill'd her mind,No room for wishing could she find,And with the thoughts that o'er it flew,Perchance a sigh was mingled too.
　　"But why should sorrow cloud thy brow?That, dearest love, which fills thee nowIs fraught with joy and ecstasy.Prepared in one alone for thee,That he within thine eye may findSolace when fortune proves unkind,And be newborn through many a kiss,That he receives with inward bliss;When'er he clasps thee to his breast.May he from all his toils find restWhen he in thy dear arms shall sink,May he new life and vigour drink:Fresh joys of youth shalt thou obtain,In merry jest rejoice again.With raillery and roguish spite,Thou now shalt tease him, now delight.Thus Love will nevermore grow old,Thus will the minstrel ne'er be cold!"
　　While he thus lives, in secret bless'd,Above him in the clouds doth restAn oak-wreath, verdant and sublime,Placed on his brow in after-time;While they are banish'd to the slough,Who their great master disavow.
　　1776.-----
　　SONNETS.
　　-----Lovingly I'll sing of love;Ever comes she from above.-----THE FRIENDLY MEETING.
　　IN spreading mantle to my chin conceald,
　　I trod the rocky path, so steep and grey,
　　Then to the wintry plain I bent my wayUneasily, to flight my bosom steel'd.
　　But sudden was the newborn day reveal'd:
　　A maiden came, in heavenly bright array,
　　Like the fair creatures of the poet's layIn realms of song. My yearning heart was heal'd.
　　Yet turn'd I thence, till she had onward pass'd,
　　While closer still the folds to draw I tried,
　　As though with heat self-kindled to grow warm;
　　But follow'd her. She stood. The die was cast!
　　No more within my mantle could I hide;
　　I threw it off,--she lay within mine arm.
　　1807-8.-----IN A WORD.
　　THUS to be chain'd for ever, can I bear?
　　A very torment that, in truth, would be.
　　This very day my new resolve shall see.--I'll not go near the lately-worshipp'd Fair.
　　Yet what excuse, my heart, can I prepare
　　In such a case, for not consulting thee?
　　But courage! while our sorrows utter weIn tones where love, grief, gladness have a share.
　　But see! the minstrel's bidding to obey,
　　Its melody pours forth the sounding lyre,
　　Yearning a sacrifice of love to bring.
　　Scarce wouldst thou think it--ready is the lay;
　　Well, but what then? Methought in the first fire
　　We to her presence flew, that lay to sing.
　　1807?.-----THE MAIDEN SPEAKS.
　　How grave thou loookest, loved one! wherefore so?
　　Thy marble image seems a type of thee;
　　Like it, no sign of life thou giv'st to me;Compared with thee, the stone appears to glow.
　　Behind his shield in ambush lurks the foe,
　　The friend's brow all-unruffled we should see.
　　I seek thee, but thou seek'st away to flee;Fix'd as this sculptured figure, learn to grow!
　　Tell me, to which should I the preference pay?
　　Must I from both with coldness meet alone?
　　The one is lifeless, thou with life art blest.
　　In short, no longer to throw words away,
　　I'll fondy kiss and kiss and kiss this stone,
　　Till thou dost tear me hence with envious breast.
　　1807.-----GROWTH.
　　O'ER field and plain, in childhood's artless days,
　　Thou sprang'st with me, on many a spring-morn fair.
　　"For such a daughter, with what pleasing care,Would I, as father, happy dwellings raise!"
　　And when thou on the world didst cast thy gaze,
　　Thy joy was then in household toils to share.
　　"Why did I trust her, why she trust me e'er?For such a sister, how I Heaven should praise!"
　　Nothing can now the beauteous growth retard;
　　Love's glowing flame within my breast is fann'd.
　　Shall I embrace her form, my grief to end?
　　Thee as a queen must I, alas, regard:
　　So high above me placed thou seem'st to stand;
　　Before a passing look I meekly bend.
　　1807?.-----FOOD IN TRAVEL.
　　IF to her eyes' bright lustre I were blind,
　　No longer would they serve my life to gild.
　　The will of destiny must be fulfilid,--This knowing, I withdrew with sadden'd mind.
　　No further happiness I now could find:
　　The former longings of my heart were still'd;
　　I sought her looks alone, whereon to buildMy joy in life,--all else was left behind.
　　Wine's genial glow, the festal banquet gay,
　　Ease, sleep, and friends, all wonted pleasures glad
　　I spurn'd, till little there remain'd to prove.
　　Now calmly through the world I wend my way:
　　That which I crave may everywhere be had,
　　With me I bring the one thing needful--love.
　　1807?.-----DEPARTURE.
　　WITH many a thousand kiss not yet content,
　　At length with One kiss I was forced to go;
　　After that bitter parting's depth of woe,I deem'd the shore from which my steps I bent,
　　Its hills, streams, dwellings, mountains, as I went,
　　A pledge of joy, till daylight ceased to glow;
　　Then on my sight did blissful visions growIn the dim-lighted, distant firmament,
　　And when at length the sea confined my gaze,
　　My ardent longing fill'd my heart once more;
　　What I had lost, unwillingly I sought.
　　Then Heaven appear'd to shed its kindly rays:
　　Methought that all I had possess'd of yore
　　Remain'd still mine--that I was reft of nought.
　　1807?.-----THE LOVING ONE WRITES.
　　THE look that thy sweet eyes on mine impress
　　The pledge thy lips to mine convey,--the kiss,--
　　He who, like me, hath knowledge sure of this,Can he in aught beside find happiness?
　　Removed from thee, friend-sever'd, in distress,
　　These thoughts I vainly struggle to dismiss:
　　They still return to that one hour of bliss,The only one; then tears my grief confess.
　　But unawares the tear makes haste to dry:
　　He loves, methinks, e'en to these glades so still,--
　　And shalt not thou to distant lands extend?
　　Receive the murmurs of his loving sigh;
　　My only joy on earth is in thy will,
　　Thy kindly will tow'rd me; a token send!
　　1807?.-----THE LOVING ONE ONCE MORE.
　　WHY do I o'er my paper once more bend?
　　Ask not too closely, dearest one, I pray
　　For, to speak truth, I've nothing now to say;Yet to thy hands at length 'twill come, dear friend.
　　Since I can come not with it, what I send
　　My undivided heart shall now convey,
　　With all its joys, hopes, pleasures, pains, to-day:All this hath no beginning, hath no end.
　　Henceforward I may ne'er to thee confide
　　How, far as thought, wish, fancy, will, can reach,
　　My faithful heart with thine is surely blended.
　　Thus stood I once enraptured by thy side,
　　Gazed on thee, and said nought. What need of speech?
　　My very being in itself was ended.
　　1807?.-----SHE CANNOT END.
　　WHEN unto thee I sent the page all white,
　　Instead of first thereon inscribing aught,
　　The space thou doubtless filledst up in sport.And sent it me, to make my joy grow bright.
　　As soon as the blue cover met my sight,
　　As well becomes a woman, quick as thought
　　I tore it open, leaving hidden nought,And read the well-known words of pure delight:
　　MY ONLY BEING! DEAREST HEART! SWEET CHILD!
　　How kindly thou my yearning then didst still
　　With gentle words, enthralling me to thee.
　　In truth methought I read thy whispers mild
　　Wherewith thou lovingly my soul didst fill,
　　E'en to myself for aye ennobling me.
　　1807?.-----NEMESIS.
　　WHEN through the nations stalks contagion wild,
　　We from them cautiously should steal away.
　　E'en I have oft with ling'ring and delayShunn'd many an influence, not to be defil'd.
　　And e'en though Amor oft my hours beguil'd,
　　At length with him preferr'd I not to play,
　　And so, too, with the wretched sons of clay,When four and three-lined verses they compil'd.
　　But punishment pursues the scoffer straight,
　　As if by serpent-torch of furies led
　　From bill to vale, from land to sea to fly.
　　I hear the genie's laughter at my fate;
　　Yet do I find all power of thinking fled
　　In sonnet-rage and love's fierce ecstasy.
　　1807-8.-----THE CHRISTMAS-BOX.
　　THIS box, mine own sweet darling, thou wilt find
　　With many a varied sweetmeat's form supplied;
　　The fruits are they of holy Christmas tide,But baked indeed, for children's use design'd.
　　I'd fain, in speeches sweet with skill combin'd,
　　Poetic sweetmeats for the feast provide;
　　But why in such frivolities confide?Perish the thought, with flattery to blind!
　　One sweet thing there is still, that from within,
　　Within us speaks,--that may be felt afar;
　　This may be wafted o'er to thee alone.
　　If thou a recollection fond canst win,
　　As if with pleasure gleam'd each well-known star,
　　The smallest gift thou never wilt disown.
　　1807.-----THE WARNING.
　　WHEN sounds the trumpet at the Judgment Day,
　　And when forever all things earthly die,
　　We must a full and true account supplyOf ev'ry useless word we dropp'd in play.
　　But what effect will all the words convey
　　Wherein with eager zeal and lovingly,
　　That I might win thy favour, labour'd I,If on thine ear alone they die away?
　　Therefore, sweet love, thy conscience bear in mind,
　　Remember well how long thou hast delay'd,
　　So that the world such sufferings may not know.
　　If I must reckon, and excuses find
　　For all things useless I to thee have said,
　　To a full year the Judgment Day will grow
　　1807?.-----THE EPOCHS.
　　ON Petrarch's heart, all other days before,
　　In flaming letters written, was impress d
　　GOOD FRIDAY. And on mine, be it confess'd,Is this year's ADVENT, as it passeth o'er.
　　I do not now begin,--I still adore
　　Her whom I early cherish'd in my breast;,
　　Then once again with prudence dispossess'd,And to whose heart I'm driven back once more.
　　The love of Petrarch, that all-glorious love,
　　Was unrequited, and, alas, full sad;
　　One long Good Friday 'twas, one heartache drear
　　But may my mistress' Advent ever prove,
　　With its palm-jubilee, so sweet and glad,
　　One endless Mayday, through the livelong year!
　　1807.-----THE DOUBTERS AND THE LOVERS.
　　THE DOUBTERS.
　　YE love, and sonnets write! Fate's strange behest!
　　The heart, its hidden meaning to declare,
　　Must seek for rhymes, uniting pair with pair:Learn, children, that the will is weak, at best.
　　Scarcely with freedom the o'erflowing breast
　　As yet can speak, and well may it beware;
　　Tempestuous passions sweep each chord that's there,Then once more sink to night and gentle rest.
　　Why vex yourselves and us, the heavy stone
　　Up the steep path but step by step to roll?
　　It falls again, and ye ne'er cease to strive.
　　THE LOVERS.
　　But we are on the proper road alone!
　　If gladly is to thaw the frozen soul,
　　The fire of love must aye be kept alive.
　　1807?.-----CHARADE.
　　Two words there 'are, both short, of beauty rare,
　　Whose sounds our lips so often love to frame,
　　But which with clearness never can proclaimThe things whose own peculiar stamp they bear.
　　'Tis well in days of age and youth so fair,
　　One on the other boldly to inflame;
　　And if those words together link'd we name,A blissful rapture we discover there.
　　But now to give them pleasure do I seek,
　　And in myself my happiness would find;
　　I hope in silence, but I hope for this:
　　Gently, as loved one's names, those words to speak
　　To see them both within one image shrin'd,
　　Both in one being to embrace with bliss.
　　1807.-----
　　EPIGRAMS.
　　-----In these numbers be express'dMeaning deep, 'neath merry jest.-----
　　TO ORIGINALS.
　　A FELLOW says: "I own no school or college;No master lives whom I acknowledge;And pray don't entertain the thoughtThat from the dead I e'er learnt aught."This, if I rightly understand,Means: "I'm a blockhead at first hand."
　　1815.-----THE SOLDIER'S CONSOLATION.
　　No! in truth there's here no lack:White the bread, the maidens black!To another town, next night:Black the bread, the maidens white!
　　1815.*-----GENIAL IMPULSE.
　　THUS roll I, never taking ease,My tub, like Saint Diogenes,Now serious am, now seek to please;Now love and hate in turn one sees;The motives now are those, now these;Now nothings, now realities.Thus roll I, never taking ease,My tub, like Saint Diogenes.
　　1810.-----NEITHER THIS NOR THAT.
　　IF thou to be a slave shouldst will,Thou'lt get no pity, but fare ill;And if a master thou wouldst be,The world will view it angrily;And if in statu quo thou stay,That thou art but a fool, they'll say.
　　1815.*-----THE WAY TO BEHAVE.
　　THOUGH tempers are bad and peevish folks swear,Remember to ruffle thy brows, friend, ne'er;And let not the fancies of women so fairE'er serve thy pleasure in life to impair.
　　1815.*-----THE BEST.
　　WHEN head and heart are busy, say,
　　What better can be found?Who neither loves nor goes astray,
　　Were better under ground.
　　1815.*-----AS BROAD AS IT'S LONG.
　　MODEST men must needs endure,
　　And the bold must humbly bow;Thus thy fate's the same, be sure,
　　Whether bold or modest thou.
　　1815.*-----THE RULE OF LIFE.
　　IF thou wouldst live unruffled by care,Let not the past torment thee e'er;As little as possible be thou annoy'd,And let the present be ever enjoy'd;Ne'er let thy breast with hate be supplied,And to God the future confide.
　　1815.*-----THE SAME, EXPANDED.
　　IF thou wouldst live unruffled by care,Let not the past torment thee e'er;If any loss thou hast to rue,Act as though thou wert born anew;Inquire the meaning of each day,What each day means itself will say;In thine own actions take thy pleasure,What others do, thou'lt duly treasure;Ne'er let thy breast with hate be supplied,And to God the future confide.
　　-----
　　IF wealth is gone--then something is gone!
　　Quick, make up thy mind,
　　And fresh wealth find.If honour is gone--then much is gone!
　　Seek glory to find,
　　And people then will alter their mind.If courage is gone--then all is gone!'Twere better that thou hadst never been born.
　　-----
　　HE who with life makes sport,
　　Can prosper never;Who rules himself in nought,
　　Is a slave ever.
　　MAY each honest effort be
　　Crown'd with lasting constancy.
　　-----
　　EACH road to the proper endRuns straight on, without a bend.
　　1825.-----CALM AT SEA.
　　SILENCE deep rules o'er the waters,
　　Calmly slumb'ring lies the main,While the sailor views with trouble
　　Nought but one vast level plain.
　　Not a zephyr is in motion!
　　Silence fearful as the grave!In the mighty waste of ocean
　　Sunk to rest is ev'ry wave.
　　1795.-----THE PROSPEROUS VOYAGE.
　　THE mist is fast clearing.And radiant is heaven,Whilst AEolus loosensOur anguish-fraught bond.The zephyrs are sighing,Alert is the sailor.Quick! nimbly be plying!The billows are riven,The distance approaches;I see land beyond!
　　1795.-----COURAGE.
　　CARELESSLY over the plain away,Where by the boldest man no pathCut before thee thou canst discern,Make for thyself a path!
　　Silence, loved one, my heart!Cracking, let it not break!Breaking, break not with thee!
　　1776.*-----MY ONLY PROPERTY.
　　I FEEL that I'm possess'd of nought,Saving the free unfetterd thought
　　Which from my bosom seeks to flow,And each propitious passing hourThat suffers me in all its power
　　A loving fate with truth to know.
　　1814.-----ADMONITION.
　　WHEREFORE ever ramble on?
　　For the Good is lying near,Fortune learn to seize alone,
　　For that Fortune's ever here.
　　1789.-----OLD AGE.
　　OLD age is courteous--no one more:For time after time he knocks at the door,But nobody says, "Walk in, sir, pray!"Yet turns he not from the door away,But lifts the latch, and enters with speed.And then they cry "A cool one, indeed!"
　　1814.-----EPITAPH.
　　As a boy, reserved and naughty;As a youth, a coxcomb and haughty;As a man, for action inclined;As a greybeard, fickle in mind.--Upon thy grave will people read:This was a very man, indeed!
　　1815.*-----RULES FOR MONARCHS.
　　IF men are never their thoughts to employ,Take care to provide them a life full of joy;But if to some profit and use thou wouldst bend them,Take care to shear them, and then defend them.
　　1815.*-----PAULO POST FUTURI.
　　WEEP ye not, ye children dear,
　　That as yet ye are unborn:For each sorrow and each tear
　　Makes the father's heart to mourn.
　　Patient be a short time to it,
　　Unproduced, and known to none;If your father cannot do it,
　　By your mother 'twill be done.
　　1784.-----THE FOOL'S EPILOGUE.
　　MANY good works I've done and ended,Ye take the praise--I'm not offended;For in the world, I've always thoughtEach thing its true position hath sought.When praised for foolish deeds am I,I set off laughing heartily;When blamed for doing something good,I take it in an easy mood.If some one stronger gives me hard blows,That it's a jest, I feign to suppose:But if 'tis one that's but my own like,I know the way such folks to strike.When Fortune smiles, I merry grow,And sing in dulci jubilo;When sinks her wheel, and tumbles me o'er,I think 'tis sure to rise once more.
　　In the sunshine of summer I ne'er lament,Because the winter it cannot prevent;And when the white snow-flakes fall around,I don my skates, and am off with a bound.Though I dissemble as I will,The sun for me will ne'er stand still;The old and wonted course is run,Until the whole of life is done;Each day the servant like the lord,In turns comes home, and goes abroad;If proud or humble the line they take,They all must eat, drink, sleep, and wake.So nothing ever vexes me;Act like the fool, and wise ye'll be!
　　1804.-----
　　PARABLES.
　　-----Joy from that in type we borrow,Which in life gives only sorrow.-----JOY.
　　A DRAGON-FLY with beauteous wingIs hov'ring o'er a silv'ry spring;I watch its motions with delight,--Now dark its colours seem, now bright;Chameleon-like appear, now blue,Now red, and now of greenish hue.Would it would come still nearer me,That I its tints might better see
　　It hovers, flutters, resting ne'er!
　　But hush! it settles on the mead.I have it safe now, I declare!
　　And when its form I closely view,
　　'Tis of a sad and dingy blue--Such, Joy-Dissector, is thy case indeed
　　1767-9.-----EXPLANATION OF AN ANTIQUE GEM,
　　A YOUNG fig-tree its form lifts high
　　Within a beauteous garden;And see, a goat is sitting by.
　　As if he were its warden.
　　But oh, Quirites, how one errs!
　　The tree is guarded badly;For round the other side there whirrs
　　And hums a beetle madly.
　　The hero with his well-mail'd coat
　　Nibbles the branches tall so;A mighty longing feels the goat
　　Gently to climb up also.
　　And so, my friends, ere long ye see
　　The tree all leafless standing;It looks a type of misery,
　　Help of the gods demanding.
　　Then listen, ye ingenuous youth,
　　Who hold wise saws respected:From he-goat and from beetles-tooth
　　A tree should be protected!
　　1815.-----CAT-PIE.
　　WHILE he is mark'd by vision clear
　　Who fathoms Nature's treasures,The man may follow, void of fear,
　　Who her proportions measures.
　　Though for one mortal, it is true,
　　These trades may both be fitted,Yet, that the things themselves are two
　　Must always be admitted.
　　Once on a time there lived a cook
　　Whose skill was past disputing,Who in his head a fancy took
　　To try his luck at shooting.
　　So, gun in hand, he sought a spot
　　Where stores of game were breeding,And there ere long a cat he shot
　　That on young birds was feeding.
　　This cat he fancied was a hare,
　　Forming a judgment hasty,So served it up for people's fare,
　　Well-spiced and in a pasty.
　　Yet many a guest with wrath was fill'd
　　(All who had noses tender):The cat that's by the sportsman kill'd
　　No cook a hare can render.
　　1810.-----LEGEND.
　　THERE lived in the desert a holy man
　　To whom a goat-footed Faun one dayPaid a visit, and thus began
　　To his surprise: "I entreat thee to prayThat grace to me and my friends may be given,That we may be able to mount to Heaven,For great is our thirst for heav'nly bliss."The holy man made answer to this:"Much danger is lurking in thy petition,Nor will it be easy to gain admission;Thou dost not come with an angel's salute;For I see thou wearest a cloven foot."The wild man paused, and then answer'd he:"What doth my goat's foot matter to thee?Full many I've known into heaven to passStraight and with ease, with the head of an ass!"
　　1815.*-----AUTHORS.
　　OVER the meadows, and down the stream,
　　And through the garden-walks straying,He plucks the flowers that fairest seem;
　　His throbbing heart brooks no delaying.His maiden then comes--oh, what ecstasy!Thy flowers thou giv'st for one glance of her eye!
　　The gard'ner next door o'er the hedge sees the youth:"I'm not such a fool as that, in good truth;My pleasure is ever to cherish each flower,And see that no birds my fruit e'er devour.But when 'tis ripe, your money, good neighbour!'Twas not for nothing I took all this labour!"And such, methinks, are the author-tribe.
　　The one his pleasures around him strews,
　　That his friends, the public, may reap, if they choose;The other would fain make them all subscribe,
　　1776.*-----THE CRITIC.
　　I HAD a fellow as my guest,Not knowing he was such a pest,And gave him just my usual fare;He ate his fill of what was there,
　　And for desert my best things swallow'd,Soon as his meal was o'er, what follow'd?Led by the Deuce, to a neighbour he went,And talk'd of my food to his heart's content:"The soup might surely have had more spice,The meat was ill-brown'd, and the wine wasn't nice."A thousand curses alight on his head!'Tis a critic, I vow! Let the dog be struck dead!
　　1776.*-----THE DILETTANTE AND THE CRITIC.
　　A BOY a pigeon once possess'd,In gay and brilliant plumage dress'd;He loved it well, and in boyish sportIts food to take from his mouth he taught,And in his pigeon he took such pride,That his joy to others he needs must confide.
　　An aged fox near the place chanc'd to dwell,Talkative, clever, and learned as well;The boy his society used to prize,Hearing with pleasure his wonders and lies.
　　"My friend the fox my pigeon must seeHe ran, and stretch'd 'mongst the bushes lay he"Look, fox, at my pigeon, my pigeon so fair!His equal I'm sure thou hast look'd upon ne'er!"
　　"Let's see!"--The boy gave it.--"'Tis really not bad;And yet, it is far from complete, I must add.The feathers, for, instance, how short! 'Tis absurd!"So he set to work straightway to pluck the poor bird.
　　The boy screamed.--"Thou must now stronger pinions supply,Or else 'twill be ugly, unable to fly."--Soon 'twas stripp'd--oh, the villain!--and torn all to pieces.The boy was heart-broken,--and so my tale ceases.
　　*         *         *         *
　　He who sees in the boy shadow'd forth his own case,Should be on his guard 'gainst the fox's whole race.
　　1776.*-----THE WRANGLER.
　　ONE day a shameless and impudent wightWent into a shop full of steel wares bright,Arranged with art upon ev'ry shelf.He fancied they were all meant for himself;And so, while the patient owner stood by,The shining goods needs must handle and try,And valued,--for how should a fool better know?--The bad things high, and the good ones low,And all with an easy self-satisfied face;Then, having bought nothing, he left the place.
　　The tradesman now felt sorely vex'd,So when the fellow went there next,A lock of steel made quite red hot.The other cried upon the spot:"Such wares as these, who'd ever buy?the steel is tarnish'd shamefully,"--Then pull'd it, like a fool about,But soon set up a piteous shout."Pray what's the matter?" the shopman spoke;The other scream'd: "Faith, a very cool joke!"
　　1815.*-----THE YELPERS.
　　OUR rides in all directions bend,
　　For business or for pleasure,Yet yelpings on our steps attend,
　　And barkings without measure.The dog that in our stable dwells,
　　After our heels is striding,And all the while his noisy yells
　　But show that we are riding.
　　1815.*-----THE STORK'S VOCATION.
　　THE stork who worms and frogs devours
　　That in our ponds reside,Why should he dwell on high church-towers,
　　With which he's not allied?
　　Incessantly he chatters there,
　　And gives our ears no rest;But neither old nor young can dare
　　To drive him from his nest.
　　I humbly ask it,--how can he
　　Give of his title proof,Save by his happy tendency
　　To soil the church's roof?-----CELEBRITY.
　　[A satire on his own Sorrows of Werther.]
　　ON bridges small and bridges greatStands Nepomucks in ev'ry state,Of bronze, wood, painted, or of stone,Some small as dolls, some giants grown;Each passer must worship before Nepomuck,Who to die on a bridge chanced to have the ill luck,When once a man with head and earsA saint in people's eyes appears,Or has been sentenced piteouslyBeneath the hangman's hand to die,He's as a noted person prized,In portrait is immortalized.Engravings, woodcuts, are supplied,And through the world spread far and wide.Upon them all is seen his name,And ev'ry one admits his claim;Even the image of the LordIs not with greater zeal ador'd.Strange fancy of the human race!Half sinner frail, half child of graceWe see HERR WERTHER of the storyIn all the pomp of woodcut glory.His worth is first made duly known,By having his sad features shownAt ev'ry fair the country round;In ev'ry alehouse too they're found.His stick is pointed by each dunce"The ball would reach his brain at once!"And each says, o'er his beer and bread:"Thank Heav'n that 'tis not we are dead!"
　　1815.*-----PLAYING AT PRIESTS.
　　WITHIN a town where parityAccording to old form we see,--That is to say, where CatholicAnd Protestant no quarrels pick,And where, as in his father's day,Each worships God in his own way,We Luth'ran children used to dwell,By songs and sermons taught as well.The Catholic clingclang in truthSounded more pleasing to our youth,For all that we encounter'd there,To us seem'd varied, joyous, fair.As children, monkeys, and mankindTo ape each other are inclin'd,We soon, the time to while away,A game at priests resolved to play.Their aprons all our sisters lentFor copes, which gave us great content;And handkerchiefs, embroider'd o'er,Instead of stoles we also wore;Gold paper, whereon beasts were traced,The bishop's brow as mitre graced.
　　Through house and garden thus in stateWe strutted early, strutted late,Repeating with all proper unction,Incessantly each holy function.The best was wanting to the game;
　　We knew that a sonorous ring
　　Was here a most important thing;But Fortune to our rescue came,For on the ground a halter lay;
　　We were delighted, and at once
　　Made it a bellrope for the nonce,And kept it moving all the day;
　　In turns each sister and each brother
　　Acted as sexton to another;All help'd to swell the joyous throng;
　　The whole proceeded swimmingly,
　　And since no actual bell had we,We all in chorus sang, Ding dong!
　　*      *      *      *      *
　　Our guileless child's-sport long was hush'd
　　In memory's tomb, like some old lay;And yet across my mind it rush'd
　　With pristine force the other day.The New-Poetic CatholicsIn ev'ry point its aptness fix!
　　1815.*-----SONGS.
　　SONGS are like painted window-panes!In darkness wrapp'd the church remains,If from the market-place we view it;Thus sees the ignoramus through it.No wonder that he deems it tame,--And all his life 'twill be the same.
　　But let us now inside repair,And greet the holy Chapel there!At once the whole seems clear and bright,Each ornament is bathed in light,And fraught with meaning to the sight.God's children! thus your fortune prize,Be edified, and feast your eyes!
　　1827.*-----POETRY.
　　GOD to his untaught children sent
　　Law, order, knowledge, art, from high,And ev'ry heav'nly favour lent,
　　The world's hard lot to qualify.They knew not how they should behave,
　　For all from Heav'n stark-naked came;But Poetry their garments gave,
　　And then not one had cause for shame.
　　1816.-----A PARABLE.
　　I PICKED a rustic nosegay lately,And bore it homewards, musing greatly;When, heated by my hand, I foundThe heads all drooping tow'rd the ground.I plac'd them in a well-cool'd glass,And what a wonder came to passThe heads soon raised themselves once more.The stalks were blooming as before,And all were in as good a caseAs when they left their native place.
　　*      *      *      *
　　So felt I, when I wond'ring heardMy song to foreign tongues transferr'd.
　　1828.-----SHOULD E'ER THE LOVELESS DAY.
　　SHOULD e'er the loveless day remainObscured by storms of hail and rain,
　　Thy charms thou showest never;I tap at window, tap at door:Come, lov'd one, come! appear once more!
　　Thou art as fair as ever!
　　1827.*-----A PLAN THE MUSES ENTERTAINED.
　　A PLAN the Muses entertain'd
　　Methodically to impart
　　To Psyche the poetic art;Prosaic-pure her soul remain'd.No wondrous sounds escaped her lyre
　　E'en in the fairest Summer night;But Amor came with glance of fire,--
　　The lesson soon was learn'd aright.
　　1827.*-----THE DEATH OF THE FLY.
　　WITH eagerness he drinks the treach'rous potion,
　　Nor stops to rest, by the first taste misled;Sweet is the draught, but soon all power of motion
　　He finds has from his tender members fled;No longer has he strength to plume his wing,No longer strength to raise his head, poor thing!E'en in enjoyment's hour his life he loses,His little foot to bear his weight refuses;So on he sips, and ere his draught is o'er,Death veils his thousand eyes for evermore.
　　1810.-----BY THE RIVER.
　　WHEN by the broad stream thou dost dwell,
　　Oft shallow is its sluggish flood;Then, when thy fields thou tendest well,
　　It o'er them spreads its slime and mud.
　　The ships descend ere daylight wanes,
　　The prudent fisher upward goes;Round reef and rock ice casts its chains,
　　And boys at will the pathway close.
　　To this attend, then, carefully,
　　And what thou wouldst, that execute!Ne'er linger, ne'er o'erhasty be,
　　For time moves on with measured foot.
　　1821.*-----THE FOX AND CRANE.
　　ONCE two persons uninvited
　　Came to join my dinner table;For the nonce they lived united,
　　Fox and crane yclept in fable.
　　Civil greetings pass'd between us
　　Then I pluck'd some pigeons tenderFor the fox of jackal-genius,
　　Adding grapes in full-grown splendour.
　　Long-neck'd flasks I put as dishes
　　For the crane, without delaying,Fill'd with gold and silver fishes,
　　In the limpid water playing.
　　Had ye witness'd Reynard planted
　　At his flat plate, all demurely,Ye with envy must have granted:
　　"Ne'er was such a gourmand, surely!"
　　While the bird with circumspection
　　On one foot, as usual, cradled,From the flasks his fish-refection
　　With his bill and long neck ladled.
　　One the pigeons praised,--the other,
　　As they went, extoll'd the fishes,Each one scoffing at his brother
　　For preferring vulgar dishes.
　　*        *        *
　　If thou wouldst preserve thy credit,
　　When thou askest folks to guzzleAt thy hoard, take care to spread it
　　Suited both for bill and muzzle.
　　1819.-----THE FOX AND HUNTSMAN.
　　HARD 'tis on a fox's traces
　　To arrive, midst forest-glades;Hopeless utterly the chase is,
　　If his flight the huntsman aids.
　　And so 'tis with many a wonder,
　　(Why A B make Ab in fact,)Over which we gape and blunder,
　　And our head and brains distract.
　　1821.*-----THE FROGS.
　　A POOL was once congeal'd with frost;The frogs, in its deep waters lost,
　　No longer dared to croak or spring;But promised, being half asleep,If suffer'd to the air to creep,
　　As very nightingales to sing.
　　A thaw dissolved the ice so strong,--They proudly steer'd themselves along,When landed, squatted on the shore,And croak'd as loudly as before.
　　1821.*-----THE WEDDING.
　　A FEAST was in a village spread,--It was a wedding-day, they said.The parlour of the inn I found,And saw the couples whirling round,Each lass attended by her lad,And all seem'd loving, blithe, and glad;
　　But on my asking for the bride,A fellow with a stare, replied:"'Tis not the place that point to raise!
　　We're only dancing in her honour;We now have danced three nights and days,
　　And not bestowed one thought upon her."
　　*      *      *      *
　　Whoe'er in life employs his eyesSuch cases oft will recognise.
　　1821.*-----BURIAL.
　　To the grave one day from a house they bore
　　A maiden;To the window the citizens went to explore;In splendour they lived, and with wealth as of yore
　　Their banquets were laden.Then thought they: "The maid to the tomb is now borne;We too from our dwellings ere long must be torn,And he that is left our departure to mourn,
　　To our riches will be the successor,
　　For some one must be their possessor.
　　1827.*-----THREATENING SIGNS.
　　IF Venus in the evening skyIs seen in radiant majesty,If rod-like comets, red as blood,Are 'mongst the constellations view'd,Out springs the Ignoramus, yelling:"The star's exactly o'er my dwelling!What woeful prospect, ah, for me!Then calls his neighbour mournfully:"Behold that awful sign of evil,Portending woe to me, poor devil!My mother's asthma ne'er will leave her,My child is sick with wind and fever;I dread the illness of my wife,A week has pass'd, devoid of strife,--And other things have reach'd my ear;The Judgment Day has come, I fear!"
　　His neighbour answered: "Friend, you're right!Matters look very had to-night.Let's go a street or two, though, hence,And gaze upon the stars from thence."--No change appears in either case.Let each remain then in his place,And wisely do the best he can,Patient as any other man.
　　1821.*-----THE BUYERS.
　　To an apple-woman's stall
　　Once some children nimbly ran;Longing much to purchase all,They with joyous haste beganSnatching up the piles there raised,While with eager eyes they gazedOn the rosy fruit so nice;But when they found out the price,Down they threw the whole they'd got,Just as if they were red hot.

　　"THE mountain village was destroy'd;But see how soon is fill'd the void!Shingles and boards, as by magic arise,The babe in his cradle and swaddling-clothes lies;How blest to trust to God's protection!"
　　Behold a wooden new erection,So that, if sparks and wind but choose,God's self at such a game must lose!

　　PALM Sunday at the Vatican
　　They celebrate with palms;With reverence bows each holy man,
　　And chaunts the ancient psalms.Those very psalms are also sung
　　With olive boughs in hand,While holly, mountain wilds among,
　　In place of palms must stand:In fine, one seeks some twig that's green,
　　And takes a willow rod,So that the pious man may e'en
　　In small things praise his God.
　　And if ye have observed it well,
　　To gain what's fit ye're able,If ye in faith can but excel;
　　Such are the myths of fable.
　　1827.*-----THREE PALINODIAS.
　　I.
　　"Incense is hut a tribute for the gods,--To mortals 'tis but poison."
　　THE smoke that from thine altar blows,
　　Can it the gods offend?For I observe thou hold'st thy nose--
　　Pray what does this portend?Mankind deem incense to excel
　　Each other earthly thing,So he that cannot bear its smell,
　　No incense e'er should bring.
　　With unmoved face by thee at least
　　To dolls is homage given;If not obstructed by the priest,
　　The scent mounts up to heaven.
　　1827.*
　　II
　　CONFLICT OF WIT AND BEAUTY.
　　SIR Wit, who is so much esteem'd,
　　And who is worthy of all honour,Saw Beauty his superior deem'd
　　By folks who loved to gaze upon her;At this he was most sorely vex'd.
　　Then came Sir Breath (long known as fit
　　To represent the cause of wit),
　　Beginning, rudely, I admit,To treat the lady with a text.To this she hearken'd not at all,But hasten'd to his principal:"None are so wise, they say, as you,--Is not the world enough for two?
　　If you are obstinate, good-bye!If wise, to love me you will try,For be assured the world can ne'erGive birth to a more handsome pair."
　　1827.*
　　=====
　　FAIR daughters were by Beauty rear'd,
　　Wit had but dull sons for his lot;So for a season it appear'd
　　Beauty was constant, Wit was not.But Wit's a native of the soil,
　　So he return'd, work'd, strove amain,And found--sweet guerdon for his toil!--
　　Beauty to quicken him again.
　　1827.*
　　III.
　　RAIN AND RAINBOW.
　　DURING a heavy storm it chancedThat from his room a cockney glancedAt the fierce tempest as it broke,While to his neighbour thus he spoke:"The thunder has our awe inspired,Our barns by lightning have been fired,--Our sins to punish, I suppose;But in return, to soothe our woes,See how the rain in torrents fell,Making the harvest promise well!But is't a rainbow that I spyExtending o'er the dark-grey sky?With it I'm sure we may dispense,The colour'd cheat! The vain pretence!"Dame Iris straightway thus replied:"Dost dare my beauty to deride?In realms of space God station'd meA type of better worlds to beTo eyes that from life's sorrows roveIn cheerful hope to Heav'n above,And, through the mists that hover hereGod and his precepts blest revere.Do thou, then, grovel like the swine,And to the ground thy snout confine,But suffer the enlighten'd eyeTo feast upon my majesty."
　　1827.*
　　VALEDICTION.
　　I ONCE was fond of fools,
　　And bid them come each day;Then each one brought his tools
　　The carpenter to play;The roof to strip first choosing,
　　Another to supply,The wood as trestles using,
　　To move it by-and-by,While here and there they ran,
　　And knock'd against each other;To fret I soon began,
　　My anger could not smother,So cried, "Get out, ye fools!"
　　At this they were offendedThen each one took his tools,
　　And so our friendship ended.
　　Since that, I've wiser been,
　　And sit beside my door;When one of them is seen,
　　I cry, "Appear no more!""Hence, stupid knave!" I bellow:
　　At this he's angry too:"You impudent old fellow!
　　And pray, sir, who are you?Along the streets we riot,
　　And revel at the fair;But yet we're pretty quiet,
　　And folks revile us ne'er.Don't call us names, then, please!"--At length I meet with ease,
　　For now they leave my door--'Tis better than before!
　　1827.*-----THE COUNTRY SCHOOLMASTER.
　　I.
　　A MASTER of a country schoolJump'd up one day from off his stool,Inspired with firm resolve to tryTo gain the best society;So to the nearest baths he walk'd,And into the saloon he stalk'd.He felt quite. startled at the door,Ne'er having seen the like before.To the first stranger made he nowA very low and graceful bow,But quite forgot to bear in mindThat people also stood behind;His left-hand neighbor's paunch he struckA grievous blow, by great ill luck;Pardon for this he first entreated,And then in haste his bow repeated.His right hand neighbor next he hit,And begg'd him, too, to pardon it;But on his granting his petition,Another was in like condition;These compliments he paid to all,Behind, before, across the hall;At length one who could stand no more,Show'd him impatiently the door.
　　*      *      *      *
　　May many, pond'ring on their crimes,A moral draw from this betimes!
　　II.
　　As he proceeded on his wayHe thought, "I was too weak to-day;To bow I'll ne'er again be seen;For goats will swallow what is green."Across the fields he now must speed,Not over stumps and stones, indeed,But over meads and cornfields sweet,Trampling down all with clumsy feet.A farmer met him by-and-by,And didn't ask him: how? or why?But with his fist saluted him.
　　"I feel new life in every limb!"Our traveller cried in ecstasy."Who art thou who thus gladden'st me?May Heaven such blessings ever send!Ne'er may I want a jovial friend!"
　　1808.*-----THE LEGEND OF THE HORSESHOE.
　　WHAT time our Lord still walk'd the earth,Unknown, despised, of humble birth,And on Him many a youth attended(His words they seldom comprehended),It ever seem'd to Him most meetTo hold His court in open street,As under heaven's broad canopyOne speaks with greater liberty.The teachings of His blessed wordFrom out His holy mouth were heard;Each market to a fane turn'd HeWith parable and simile.
　　One day, as tow'rd a town He roved,In peace of mind with those He loved,Upon the path a something gleam'd;A broken horseshoe 'twas, it seem'd.So to St. Peter thus He spake:"That piece of iron prythee take!"St. Peter's thoughts had gone astray,--He had been musing on his wayRespecting the world's government,A dream that always gives content,For in the head 'tis check'd by nought;This ever was his dearest thought,For him this prize was far too meanHad it a crown and sceptre been!But, surely, 'twasn't worth the troubleFor half a horseshoe to bend double!And so he turn'd away his head,As if he heard not what was said,
　　The Lord, forbearing tow'rd all men,Himself pick'd up the horseshoe then(He ne'er again like this stoop'd down).And when at length they reach'd the town,Before a smithy He remain'd,And there a penny for 't obtain'd.As they the market-place went by,Some beauteous cherries caught His eye:Accordingly He bought as manyAs could be purchased for a penny,And then, as oft His wont had been,Placed them within His sleeve unseen.
　　They went out by another gate,O'er plains and fields proceeding straight,No house or tree was near the spot,The sun was bright, the day was hot;In short, the weather being such,A draught of water was worth much.The Lord walk'd on before them all,And let, unseen, a cherry fall.St. Peter rush'd to seize it hold,As though an apple 'twere of gold;His palate much approv'd the berry;The Lord ere long another cherryOnce more let fall upon the plain;St. Peter forthwith stoop'd again.The Lord kept making him thus bendTo pick up cherries without end.For a long time the thing went on;The Lord then said, in cheerful tone:"Had'st thou but moved when thou wert bid,Thou of this trouble had'st been rid;The man who small things scorns, will next,By things still smaller be perplex'd."

　　ART.
　　-----Artist, fashion! talk not long!Be a breath thine only song!-----THE DROPS OF NECTAR.
　　WHEN Minerva, to give pleasureTo Prometheus, her well-loved one,Brought a brimming bowl of nectarFrom the glorious realms of heavenAs a blessing for his creatures,And to pour into their bosomsImpulses for arts ennobling,She with rapid footstep hasten'd,Fearing Jupiter might see her,And the golden goblet trembled,And there fell a few drops from itOn the verdant plain beneath her.Then the busy bees flew thitherStraightway, eagerly to drink them,And the butterfly came quicklyThat he, too, might find a drop there;Even the misshapen spiderThither crawl'd and suck'd with vigour.
　　To a happy end they tasted,They, and other gentle insects!For with mortals now divide theyArt膖hat noblest gift of all.

　　".... With mournful majesiyA heap of solitary ruins lie,Half sepulchred in dust, the bankrupt heirTo prodigal antiquity...."-----LOVE AS A LANDSCAPE PAINTER.
　　ON a rocky peak once sat I early,Gazing on the mist with eyes unmoving;Stretch'd out like a pall of greyish texture,All things round, and all above it cover'd.
　　Suddenly a boy appear'd beside me,Saying "Friend, what meanest thou by gazingOn the vacant pall with such composure?Hast thou lost for evermore all pleasureBoth in painting cunningly, and forming?"On the child I gazed, and thought in secret:"Would the boy pretend to be a master?"
　　"Wouldst thou be for ever dull and idle,"Said the boy, "no wisdom thou'lt attain to;See, I'll straightway paint for thee a figure,--How to paint a beauteous figure, show thee."
　　And he then extended his fore-finger,--(Ruddy was it as a youthful rosebud)Tow'rd the broad and far outstretching carpet,And began to draw there with his finger.
　　First on high a radiant sun he painted,Which upon mine eyes with splendour glisten'd,And he made the clouds with golden border,Through the clouds he let the sunbeams enter;Painted then the soft and feathery summitsOf the fresh and quicken'd trees, behind themOne by one with freedom drew the mountains;Underneath he left no lack of water,But the river painted so like Nature,That it seem'd to glitter in the sunbeams,That it seem'd against its banks to murmur.
　　Ah, there blossom'd flowers beside the river,And bright colours gleam'd upon the meadow,Gold, and green, and purple, and enamell'd,All like carbuncles and emeralds seeming!
　　Bright and clear he added then the heavens,And the blue-tinged mountains far and farther,So that I, as though newborn, enrapturedGazed on, now the painter, now the picture.
　　Then spake he: "Although I have convinced theeThat this art I understand full surely,Yet the hardest still is left to show thee."
　　Thereupon he traced, with pointed finger,And with anxious care, upon the forest,At the utmost verge, where the strong sunbeamsFrom the shining ground appear'd reflected,
　　Traced the figure of a lovely maiden,Fair in form, and clad in graceful fashion,Fresh the cheeks beneath her brown locks' ambush,And the cheeks possess'd the selfsame colourAs the finger that had served to paint them.
　　"Oh thou boy!" exclaim'd I then, "what masterIn his school received thee as his pupil,Teaching thee so truthfully and quicklyWisely to begin, and well to finish?"
　　Whilst I still was speaking, lo, a zephyrSoftly rose, and set the tree-tops moving,Curling all the wavelets on the river,And the perfect maiden's veil, too, fill'd it,And to make my wonderment still greater,Soon the maiden set her foot in motion.On she came, approaching tow'rd the stationWhere still sat I with my arch instructor.
　　As now all, yes, all thus moved together,--Flowers, river, trees, the veil,--all moving,--And the gentle foot of that most fair one,Can ye think that on my rock I linger'd,Like a rock, as though fast-chain'd and silent?

　　1816.-----THE METAMORPHOSIS OF PLANTS.
　　THOU art confused, my beloved, at, seeing the thousandfold union
　　Shown in this flowery troop, over the garden dispers'd;any a name dost thou hear assign'd; one after another
　　Falls on thy list'ning ear, with a barbarian sound.None resembleth another, yet all their forms have a likeness;
　　Therefore, a mystical law is by the chorus proclaim'd;Yes, a sacred enigma! Oh, dearest friend, could I only
　　Happily teach thee the word, which may the mystery solve!Closely observe how the plant, by little and little progressing,
　　Step by step guided on, changeth to blossom and fruit!First from the seed it unravels itself, as soon as the silent
　　Fruit-bearing womb of the earth kindly allows Its escape,And to the charms of the light, the holy, the ever-in-motion,
　　Trusteth the delicate leaves, feebly beginning to shoot.Simply slumber'd the force in the seed; a germ of the future,
　　Peacefully lock'd in itself, 'neath the integument lay,Leaf and root, and bud, still void of colour, and shapeless;
　　Thus doth the kernel, while dry, cover that motionless life.Upward then strives it to swell, in gentle moisture confiding,
　　And, from the night where it dwelt, straightway ascendeth to light.Yet still simple remaineth its figure, when first it appeareth;
　　And 'tis a token like this, points out the child 'mid the plants.Soon a shoot, succeeding it, riseth on high, and reneweth,
　　Piling-up node upon node, ever the primitive form;Yet not ever alike: for the following leaf, as thou seest,
　　Ever produceth itself, fashioned in manifold ways.Longer, more indented, in points and in parts more divided,
　　Which. all-deform'd until now, slept in the organ below,So at length it attaineth the noble and destined perfection,
　　Which, in full many a tribe, fills thee with wondering awe.Many ribb'd and tooth'd, on a surface juicy and swelling,
　　Free and unending the shoot seemeth in fullness to be;Yet here Nature restraineth, with powerful hands, the formation,
　　And to a perfecter end, guideth with softness its growth,Less abundantly yielding the sap, contracting the vessels,
　　So that the figure ere long gentler effects doth disclose.Soon and in silence is check'd the growth of the vigorous branches,
　　And the rib of the stalk fuller becometh in form.Leafless, however, and quick the tenderer stem then up-springeth,
　　And a miraculous sight doth the observer enchant.Ranged in a circle, in numbers that now are small, and now countless,
　　Gather the smaller-sized leaves, close by the side of their like.Round the axis compress'd the sheltering calyx unfoldeth,
　　And, as the perfectest type, brilliant-hued coronals forms.Thus doth Nature bloom, in glory still nobler and fuller,
　　Showing, in order arranged, member on member uprear'd.Wonderment fresh dost thou feel, as soon as the stem rears the flower
　　Over the scaffolding frail of the alternating leaves.But this glory is only the new creation's foreteller,
　　Yes, the leaf with its hues feeleth the hand all divine,And on a sudden contracteth itself; the tenderest figures
　　Twofold as yet, hasten on, destined to blend into one.Lovingly now the beauteous pairs are standing together,
　　Gather'd in countless array, there where the altar is raised.Hymen hovereth o'er them, and scents delicious and mighty
　　Stream forth their fragrance so sweet, all things enliv'ning around.Presently, parcell'd out, unnumber'd germs are seen swelling,
　　Sweetly conceald in the womb, where is made perfect the fruit.Here doth Nature close the ring of her forces eternal;
　　Yet doth a new one, at once, cling to the one gone before,So that the chain be prolonged for ever through all generations,
　　And that the whole may have life, e'en as enjoy'd by each part.Now, my beloved one, turn thy gaze on the many-hued thousands
　　Which, confusing no more, gladden the mind as they wave.Every plant unto thee proclaimeth the laws everlasting,
　　Every flowered speaks louder and louder to thee;But if thou here canst decipher the mystic words of the goddess,
　　Everywhere will they be seen, e'en though the features are changed.Creeping insects may linger, the eager butterfly hasten,--
　　Plastic and forming, may man change e'en the figure decreed!Oh, then, bethink thee, as well, how out of the germ of acquaintance,
　　Kindly intercourse sprang, slowly unfolding its leaves;Soon how friendship with might unveil'd itself in our bosoms,
　　And how Amor, at length, brought forth blossom and fruitThink of the manifold ways wherein Nature hath lent to our feelings,
　　Silently giving them birth, either the first or the last!Yes, and rejoice in the present day! For love that is holy
　　Seeketh the noblest of fruits,--that where the thoughts are the same,Where the opinions agree,--that the pair may, in rapt contemplation,
　　Lovingly blend into one,--find the more excellent world.

The few otherpieces included by Goethe under the title of Religion and Churchare polemical, and devoid of interest to the English reader.]
　　WHAT wondrous noise is heard around!Through heaven exulting voices sound,
　　A mighty army marches onBy thousand millions follow'd, lo,To yon dark place makes haste to go
　　God's Son, descending from His throne!He goes--the tempests round Him break,
　　As Judge and Hero cometh He;He goes--the constellations quake,
　　The sun, the world quake fearfully.
　　I see Him in His victor-car,On fiery axles borne afar,
　　Who on the cross for us expired.The triumph to yon realms He shows,--Remote from earth, where star ne'er glows,
　　The triumph He for us acquired.He cometh, Hell to extirpate,
　　Whom He, by dying, wellnigh kill'd;He shall pronounce her fearful fate
　　Hark! now the curse is straight fulfill'd.
　　Hell sees the victor come at last,She feels that now her reign is past,
　　She quakes and fears to meet His sight;She knows His thunders' terrors dread,In vain she seeks to hide her head,
　　Attempts to fly, but vain is flight;Vainly she hastes to 'scape pursuit
　　And to avoid her Judge's eye;The Lord's fierce wrath restrains her foot
　　Like brazen chains,--she cannot fly.
　　Here lies the Dragon, trampled down,He lies, and feels God's angry frown,
　　He feels, and grinneth hideously;He feels Hell's speechless agonies,A thousand times he howls and sighs:
　　"Oh, burning flames! quick, swallow me!"There lies he in the fiery waves,
　　By torments rack'd and pangs infernal,Instant annihilation craves,
　　And hears, those pangs will be eternal.
　　Those mighty squadrons, too, are here,The partners of his cursed career,
　　Yet far less bad than he were they.Here lies the countless throng combined,In black and fearful crowds entwined,
　　While round him fiery tempests play;He sees how they the Judge avoid,
　　He sees the storm upon them feed,Yet is not at the sight o'erjoy'd,
　　Because his pangs e'en theirs exceed.
　　The Son of Man in triumph passesDown to Hell's wild and black morasses,
　　And there unfolds His majesty.Hell cannot bear the bright array,For, since her first created day.
　　Darkness alone e'er govern'd she.She lay remote from ev'ry light
　　With torments fill'd in Chaos here;God turn'd for ever from her sight
　　His radiant features' glory clear.
　　Within the realms she calls her own,She sees the splendour of the Son,
　　His dreaded glories shining forth;She sees Him clad in rolling thunder,She sees the rocks all quake with wonder,
　　When God before her stands in wrath.She sees He comes her Judge to be,
　　She feels the awful pangs inside her,Herself to slay endeavours she,
　　But e'en this comfort is denied her.
　　Now looks she back, with pains untold,Upon those happy times of old,
　　When those glories gave her joy;When yet her heart revered the truth,When her glad soul, in endless youth
　　And rapture dwelt, without alloy.She calls to mind with madden'd thought
　　How over man her wiles prevail'd;To take revenge on God she sought,
　　And feels the vengeance it entail'd.
　　God was made man, and came to earth.Then Satan cried with fearful mirth:
　　"E'en He my victim now shall be!"He sought to slay the Lord Most High,The world's Creator now must die;
　　But, Satan, endless woe to thee!Thou thought'st to overcome Him then,
　　Rejoicing in His suffering;But he in triumph comes again
　　To bind thee: Death! where is thy sting?
　　Speak, Hell! where is thy victory?Thy power destroy'd and scatter'd see!
　　Know'st thou not now the Highest's might?See, Satan, see thy rule o'erthrown!
　　By thousand-varying pangs weigh'd down,Thou dwell'st in dark and endless night.
　　As though by lightning struck thou liest,No gleam of rapture far or wide;
　　In vain! no hope thou there decriest,--For me alone Messiah died!
　　A howling rises through the air,A trembling fills each dark vault there,
　　When Christ to Hell is seen to come.She snarls with rage, but needs must cowerBefore our mighty hero's power;
　　He signs--and Hell is straightway dumb.Before his voice the thunders break,
　　On high His victor-banner blows;E'en angels at His fury quake,
　　When Christ to the dread judgment goes.
　　Now speaks He, and His voice is thunder,He speaks, the rocks are rent in sunder,
　　His breath is like devouring flames.Thus speaks He: "Tremble, ye accurs'd!He who from Eden hurl'd you erst,
　　Your kingdom's overthrow proclaims.Look up! My children once were ye,
　　Your arms against Me then ye turn'd,Ye fell, that ye might sinners be,
　　Ye've now the wages that ye earn'd.
　　"My greatest foeman from that day,Ye led my dearest friends astray,--
　　As ye had fallen, man must fall.To kill him evermore ye sought,'They all shall die the death,' ye thought;
　　But howl! for Me I won them all.For them alone did I descend,
　　For them pray'd, suffer'd, perish'd I.Ye ne'er shall gain your wicked end;
　　Who trusts in Me shall never die.
　　"In endless chains here lie ye now,Nothing can save you from the slough.
　　Not boldness, not regret for crime.Lie, then, and writhe in brimstone fire!'Twas ye yourselves drew down Mine ire,
　　Lie and lament throughout all time!And also ye, whom I selected,
　　E'en ye forever I disown,For ye My saving grace rejected
　　Ye murmur? blame yourselves alone!
　　"Ye might have lived with Me in bliss,For I of yore had promis'd this;
　　Ye sinn'd, and all My precepts slightedWrapp'd in the sleep of sin ye dwelt,Now is My fearful judgment felt,
　　By a just doom your guilt requited."--Thus spake He, and a fearful storm
　　From Him proceeds, the lightnings glow,The thunders seize each wicked form,
　　And hurl them in the gulf below.
　　The God-man closeth Hell's sad doors,In all His majesty He soars
　　From those dark regions back to light.He sitteth at the Father's side;Oh, friends, what joy doth this betide!
　　For us, for us He still will fight!The angels sacred quire around
　　Rejoice before the mighty Lord,So that all creatures hear the sound:
　　"Zebaoth's God be aye ador'd!"

　　ANTIQUES.
　　-----LEOPOLD, DUKE OF BRUNSWICK.
　　[Written on the occasion of the death, by drowning, of thePrince.]
　　THOU wert forcibly seized by the hoary lord of the river,--
　　Holding thee, ever he shares with thee his streaming domain,Calmly sleepest thou near his urn as it silently trickles,
　　Till thou to action art roused, waked by the swift-rolling flood.Kindly be to the people, as when thou still wert a mortal,
　　Perfecting that as a god, which thou didst fail in, as man.
　　1785.-----TO THE HUSBANDMAN.
　　SMOOTHLY and lightly the golden seed by the furrow is cover'd;
　　Yet will a deeper one, friend, cover thy bones at the last.Joyously plough'd and sow'd! Here food all living is budding,
　　E'en from the side of the tomb Hope will not vanish away.
　　1789.*-----ANACREON'S GRAVE.
　　HERE where the roses blossom, where vines round the laurels are twining,
　　Where the turtle-dove calls, where the blithe cricket is heard,Say, whose grave can this be, with life by all the Immortals
　　Beauteously planted and deck'd?--Here doth Anacreon sleepSpring and summer and autumn rejoiced the thrice-happy minstrel,
　　And from the winter this mound kindly hath screen'd him at last.
　　1789.*-----THE BRETHREN.
　　SLUMBER and Sleep, two brethren ordain'd by the gods to their service,
　　Were by Prometheus implored, comfort to give to his race;But though so light to the gods, too heavy for man was their burden,
　　We in their slumber find sleep, we in their sleep meet with death.
　　1789.*-----MEASURE OF TIME.
　　EROS, what mean'st thou by this? In each of thine hands is an hourglass!
　　What, oh thou frivolous god! twofold thy measure of time?"Slowly run from the one, the hours of lovers when parted;
　　While through the other they rush swiftly, as soon as they meet."
　　1789.*-----WARNING.
　　WAKEN not Amor from sleep! The beauteous urchin still slumbers;
　　Go, and complete thou the task, that to the day is assign'd!Thus doth the prudent mother with care turn time to her profit,
　　While her babe is asleep, for 'twill awake but too soon.
　　1785.*-----SOLITUDE.
　　OH ye kindly nymphs, who dwell 'mongst the rocks and the thickets,
　　Grant unto each whatsoe'er he may in silence desire!Comfort impart to the mourner, and give to the doubter instruction,
　　And let the lover rejoice, finding the bliss that he craves.For from the gods ye received what they ever denied unto mortals,
　　Power to comfort and aid all who in you may confide.
　　1782.-----THE CHOSEN CLIFF.
　　HERE in silence the lover fondly mused on his loved one;
　　Gladly he spake to me thus: "Be thou my witness, thou stone!Yet thou must not be vainglorious, thou hast many companions;
　　Unto each rock on the plain, where I, the happy one, dwell,Unto each tree of the wood that I cling to, as onward I ramble,
　　'Be thou a sign of my bliss!' shout I, and then 'tis ordain'd.Yet to thee only I lend a voice, as a Muse from the people
　　Chooseth one for herself, kissing his lips as a friend."
　　1782.-----THE CONSECRATED SPOT.
　　WHEN in the dance of the Nymphs, in the moonlight so holy assembled,
　　Mingle the Graces, down from Olympus in secret descending,Here doth the minstrel hide, and list to their numbers enthralling,
　　Here doth he watch their silent dances' mysterious measure.All that is glorious in Heaven, and all that the earth in her beauty
　　Ever hath brought into life, the dreamer awake sees before him;All he repeats to the Muses, and lest the gods should be anger'd,
　　How to tell of secrets discreetly, the Muses instruct him.
　　1789.*-----THE INSTRUCTORS.
　　WHEN Diogenes quietly sunn'd himself in his barrel,
　　When Calanus with joy leapt in the flame-breathing grave,Oh, what noble lessons were those for the rash son of Philip,
　　Were not the lord of the world e'en for instruction too great!
　　1789.*-----THE UNEQUAL MARRIAGE,
　　EVEN this heavenly pair were unequally match'd when united:
　　Psyche grew older and wise, Amor remain'd still a child,
　　1789.*-----EXCUSE.
　　THOU dost complain of woman for changing from one to another?
　　Censure her not: for she seeks one who will constant remain.
　　1789.*-----SAKONTALA.
　　WOULDST thou the blossoms of spring, as well as the fruits of the autumn,
　　Wouldst thou what charms and delights, wouldst thou what
　　plenteously, feeds,Would thou include both Heaven and earth in one designation,
　　All that is needed is done, when I Sakontala name.
　　1792.-----THE MUSE'S MIRROR.
　　EARLY one day, the Muse, when eagerly bent on adornment,Follow'd a swift-running streamlet, the quietest nook by it seeking.Quickly and noisily flowing, the changeful surface distortedEver her moving form; the goddess departed in anger.Yet the stream call'd mockingly after her, saying: "What, truly!Wilt thou not view, then, the truth, in my mirror so clearly depicted?"But she already was far away, on the brink of the ocean,In her figure rejoicing, and duly arranging her garland.
　　1799.*-----PHOEBUS AND HERMES.
　　DELOS' stately ruler, and Maia's son, the adroit one,
　　Warmly were striving, for both sought the great prize to obtain.Hermes the lyre demanded, the lyre was claim'd by Apollo,
　　Yet were the hearts of the foes fruitlessly nourish'd by hope.For on a sudden Ares burst in, with fury decisive,
　　Dashing in twain the gold toy, brandishing wildly his sword.Hermes, malicious one, laughed beyond measure; yet deep-seated sorrow
　　Seized upon Phoebus's heart, seized on the heart of each Muse.
　　1799.*-----THE NEW AMOR.
　　AMOR, not the child, the youthful lover of Psyche,Look'd round Olympus one day, boldly, to triumph inured;There  he espied a goddess, the fairest amongst the immortals,--Venus Urania she,--straight was his passion inflamed.Even the holy one powerless proved, alas! 'gainst his wooing,--Tightly embraced in his arm, held her the daring one fast.Then from their union arose a new, a more beauteous Amor,Who from his father his wit, grace from his mother derives.Ever thou'lt find him join'd in the kindly Muses' communion,And his charm-laden bolt foundeth the love of the arts.
　　1792.-----THE GARLANDS.
　　KLOPSTOCK would lead us away from Pindus; no longer for laurelMay we be eager--the homely acorn alone must content us;Yet he himself his more-than-epic crusade is conductingHigh on Golgotha's summit, that foreign gods he may honour!Yet, on what hill he prefers, let him gather the angels together,Suffer deserted disciples to weep o'er the grave of the just one:There where a hero and saint hath died, where a bard breath'd his numbers,Both for our life and our death an ensample of courage resplendentAnd of the loftiest human worth to bequeath,--ev'ry nationThere will joyously kneel in devotion ecstatic, reveringThorn and laurel garland, and all its charms and its tortures.
　　1815.*-----THE SWISS ALPS.
　　YESTERDAY brown was still thy head, as the locks of my loved one,
　　Whose sweet image so dear silently beckons afar.Silver-grey is the early snow to-day on thy summit,
　　Through the tempestuous night streaming fast over thy brow.Youth, alas, throughout life as closely to age is united
　　As, in some changeable dream, yesterday blends with to-day.
　　Uri, October 7th, 1797.-----DISTICHS.
　　CHORDS are touch'd by Apollo,--the death-laden bow, too, he bendeth;
　　While he the shepherdess charms, Python he lays in the dust.-----WHAT is merciful censure? To make thy faults appear smaller?
　　May be to veil them? No, no! O'er them to raise thee on high!-----DEMOCRATIC food soon cloys on the multitude's stomach;But I'll wager, ere long, other thou'lt give them instead.-----WHAT in France has pass'd by, the Germans continue to practise,
　　For the proudest of men flatters the people and fawns.-----WHO is the happiest of men? He who values the merits of others,And in their pleasure takes joy, even as though 'twere his own.-----NOT in the morning alone, not only at mid-day he charmeth;
　　Even at setting, the sun is still the same glorious planet.-----
　　VENETIAN EPIGRAMS.(Written in 1790.)-----URN and sarcophagus erst were with life adorn'd by the heathen
　　Fauns are dancing around, while with the Bacchanal troopChequerd circles they trace; and the goat-footed, puffy-cheekd player
　　Wildly produceth hoarse tones out of the clamorous horn.Cymbals and drums resound; we see and we hear, too, the marble.
　　Fluttering bird! oh how sweet tastes the ripe fruit to thy bill!Noise there is none to disturb thee, still less to scare away Amor,
　　Who, in the midst of the throng, learns to delight in his torch.Thus doth fullness overcome death; and the ashes there cover'd
　　Seem, in that silent domain, still to be gladdend with life.Thus may the minstrel's sarcophagus be hereafter surrounded
　　With such a scroll, which himself richly with life has adorn'd.-----CLASP'D in my arms for ever eagerly hold I my mistress,
　　Ever my panting heart throbs wildly against her dear breast,And on her knees forever is leaning my head, while I'm gazing
　　Now  on her sweet-smiling mouth, now on her bright sparkling eyes."Oh thou effeminate!" spake one, "and thus, then, thy days thou
　　art spending?"
　　Ah, they in sorrow are spent. List while I tell thee my tale:Yes! I have left my only joy in life far behind me,
　　Twenty long days hath my car borne me away from her sight.Vettrini defy me, while crafty chamberlains flatter,
　　And the sly Valet de place thinks but of lies and deceit.If I attempt to escape, the Postmaster fastens upon me,
　　Postboys the upper hand get, custom-house duties enrage."Truly, I can't understand thee! thou talkest enigmas! thou seemest
　　Wrapp'd in a blissful repose, glad as Rinaldo of yore:Ah, I  myself understand full well; 'tis my body that travels,
　　And 'tis my spirit that rests still in my mistress's arms.-----I WOULD liken this gondola unto the soft-rocking cradle,
　　And the chest on its deck seems a vast coffin to be.Yes! 'tween the cradle and coffin, we totter and waver for ever
　　On the mighty canal, careless our lifetime is spent.-----WHY are the people thus busily moving? For food they are seeking,
　　Children they fain would beget, feeding them well as they can.Traveller, mark this well, and when thou art home, do thou likewise!
　　More can no mortal effect, work with what ardour he will.-----I WOULD compare to the land this anvil, its lord to the hammer,
　　And to the people the plate, which in the middle is bent.Sad is the poor tin-plate's lot, when the blows are but given at random:
　　Ne'er will the kettle be made, while they uncertainly fall.-----WHAT is the life of a man? Yet thousands are ever accustom'dFreely to talk about man,--what he has done, too, and how.Even less is a poem; yet thousands read and enjoy it,Thousands abuse it.--My friend, live and continue to rhyme!-----MERRY'S the trade of a poet; but somewhat a dear one, I fear me
　　For, as my book grows apace, all of my sequins I lose.-----Is' thou'rt in earnest, no longer delay, but render me happy;Art thou in jest? Ah, sweet love! time for all jesting is past.-----ART thou, then, vex'd at my silence? What shall I speak of? Thou markest
　　Neither my sorrowful sigh, nor my soft eloquent look.Only one goddess is able the seal of my lips to unloosen,--
　　When by Aurora I'm found, slumbering calm on thy breast.Ah, then my hymn in the ears of the earliest gods shall be chaunted,
　　As the Memnonian form breath'd forth sweet secrets in song.-----IN the twilight of morning to climb to the top of the mountain,--
　　Thee to salute, kindly star, earliest herald of day,--And to await, with impatience, the gaze of the ruler of heaven,--
　　Youthful delight, oh oft lur'st thou me out in the night!Oh ye heralds of day, ye heavenly eyes of my mistress,
　　Now ye appear, and the sun evermore riseth too soon.-----THOU art amazed, and dost point to the ocean. It seems to be burning,Flame-crested billows in play dart round our night-moving bark.Me it astonisheth not,--of the ocean was born Aphrodite,--Did not a flame, too, proceed from her for us, in her son?-----GLEAMING the ocean appear'd, the beauteous billows were smiling,
　　While a fresh, favouring wind, filling the sails, drove us on.Free was my bosom from yearning; yet soon my languishing glances
　　Turn'd themselves backward in haste, seeking the snow-cover'd hills.Treasures unnumber'd are southwards lying. Yet one to the northwards
　　Draws me resistlessly back, like the strong magnet in force.-----SPACIOUS and fair is the world; yet oh! how I thank the kind heavens
　　That I a garden possess, small though it be, yet mine own.One which enticeth me homewards; why should a gardener wander?
　　Honour and pleasure he finds, when to his garden he looks.-----AH, my maiden is going! she mounts the vessel! My monarch,
　　AEolus! potentate dread! keep ev'ry storm far away!"Oh, thou fool!" cried the god:"ne'er fear the blustering tempest;
　　When Love flutters his wings, then mayst thou dread the soft breeze."-----
　　ELEGIES.
　　-----PART I.
　　ROMAN ELEGIES.
　　[The Roman Elegies were written in the same year as the VenetianEpigrams--viz. 1790.]
　　SPEAK, ye stones, I entreat! Oh speak, ye palaces lofty!
　　Utter a word, oh ye streets! Wilt thou not, Genius, awake?All that thy sacred walls, eternal Rome, hold within them
　　Teemeth with life; but to me, all is still silent and dead.Oh, who will whisper unto me,--when shall I see at the casement
　　That one beauteous form, which, while it scorcheth, revives?Can I as yet not discern the road, on which I for ever
　　To her and from her shall go, heeding not time as it flies?Still do I mark the churches, palaces, ruins, and columns,
　　As a wise traveller should, would he his journey improve.Soon all this will be past; and then will there be but one temple,
　　Amor's temple alone, where the Initiate may go.Thou art indeed a world, oh Rome; and yet, were Love absent,
　　Then would the world be no world, then would e'en Rome be no Rome.-----Do not repent, mine own love, that thou so soon didst surrender
　　Trust me, I deem thee not bold! reverence only I feel.Manifold workings the darts of Amor possess; some but scratching,
　　Yet with insidious effect, poison the bosom for years.Others mightily feather'd, with fresh and newly-born sharpness
　　Pierce to the innermost bone, kindle the blood into flame.In the heroical times, when loved each god and each goddess,
　　Longing attended on sight; then with fruition was bless'd.Think'st thou the goddess had long been thinking of love and its pleasures
　　When she, in Ida's retreats, own'd to Anchises her flame?Had but Luna delayd to kiss the beautiful sleeper,
　　Oh, by Aurora, ere long, he had in envy been rous'd!Hero Leander espied at the noisy feast, and the lover
　　Hotly and nimbly, ere long, plunged in the night-cover'd flood.Rhea Silvia, virgin princess, roam'd near the Tiber,
　　Seeking there water to draw, when by the god she was seiz'd.Thus were the sons of Mars begotten! The twins did a she-wolf
　　Suckle and nurture,--and Rome call'd herself queen of the world,-----ALEXANDER, and Caesar, and Henry, and Fred'rick, the mighty,
　　On me would gladly bestow half of the glory they earn'd,Could I but grant unto each one night on the couch where I'm lying;
　　But they, by Orcus's night, sternly, alas! are held down.Therefore rejoice, oh thou living one, blest in thy love-lighted homestead,
　　Ere the dark Lethe's sad wave wetteth thy fugitive foot.-----THESE few leaves, oh ye Graces, a bard presents, in your honour,
　　On your altar so pure, adding sweet rosebuds as well,And he does it with hope. The artist is glad in his workshop,
　　When a Pantheon it seems round him for ever to bring.Jupiter knits his godlike brow,--her's, Juno up-lifteth;
　　Phoebus strides on before, shaking his curly-lock'd headCalmly and drily Minerva looks down, and Hermes the light one,
　　Turneth his glances aside, roguish and tender at once.But tow'rds Bacchus, the yielding, the dreaming, raiseth Cythere
　　Looks both longing and sweet, e'en in the marble yet moist.Of his embraces she thinks with delight, and seems to be asking
　　"Should not our glorious son take up his place by our side?"-----AMOR is ever a rogue, and all who believe him are cheated!
　　To me the hypocrite came: "Trust me, I pray thee, this once.Honest is now my intent,--with grateful thanks I acknowledge
　　That thou thy life and thy works hast to my worship ordain'd.See, I have follow'd thee thither, to Rome, with kindly intention,
　　Hoping to give thee mine aid, e'en in the foreigner's land.Every trav'ller complains that the quarters he meets with are wretched
　　Happily lodged, though, is he, who is by Amor receiv'd.Thou dost observe the ruins of ancient buildings with wonder,
　　Thoughtfully wandering on, over each time-hallow'd spot.Thou dost honour still more the worthy relics created
　　By the few artists--whom I loved in their studios to seek.I 'twas fashion'd those forms! thy pardon,--I boast not at present;
　　Presently thou shalt confess, that what I tell thee is true.Now that thou serv'st me more idly, where are the beauteous figures,
　　Where are the colours, the light, which thy creations once fill'd?Hast thou a mind again to form? The school of the Grecians
　　Still remains open, my friend; years have not barr'd up its doors.I, the teacher, am ever young, and love all the youthful,
　　Love not the subtle and old; Mother, observe what I say!Still was new the Antique, when yonder blest ones were living;
　　Happily live,--and, in thee, ages long vanish'd will live!Food for song, where hop'st thou to find it? I only can give it,
　　And a more excellent style, love, and love only can teach."Thus did the Sophist discourse. What mortal, alas! could resist him?
　　And when a master commands, I have been train'd to obey.Now he deceitfully keeps his word, gives food for my numbers,
　　But, while he does so, alas! robs me of time, strength, and mind.Looks, and pressure of hands, and words of kindness, and kisses,
　　Syllables teeming with thought, by a fond pair are exchang'd.Then becomes whispering, talk,--and stamm'ring, a language enchanting;
　　Free from all prosody's rules, dies such a hymn on the ear.Thee, Aurora, I used to own as the friend of the Muses;
　　Hath, then, Amor the rogue cheated, Aurora, e'en thee?Thou dost appear to me now as his friend, and again dost awake me
　　Unto a day of delight, while at his altar I kneel.All her locks I find on my bosom, her head is reposing,
　　Pressing with softness the arm, which round her neck is entwin'd;Oh! what a joyous awak'ning, ye hours so peaceful, succeeded,
　　Monument sweet of the bliss which had first rock'd us to sleepIn her slumber she moves, and sinks, while her face is averted,
　　Far on the breadth of the couch, leaving her hand still in mineHeartfelt love unites us for ever, and yearnings unsullied,
　　And our cravings alone claim for themselves the exchange.One faint touch of the hand, and her eyes so heavenly see I
　　Once more open. Ah, no! let me still look on that form!Closed still remain! Ye make me confused and drunken, ye rob me
　　Far too soon of the bliss pure contemplation affords.Mighty, indeed, are these figures! these limbs, how gracefully rounded!
　　Theseus, could'st thou e'er fly, whilst Ariadne thus slept?Only one single kiss on these lips! Oh, Theseus, now leave us!
　　Gaze on her eyes! she awakes--Firmly she holds thee embrac'd-----PART II.
　　ALEXIS AND DORA.
　　[This beautiful poem was first published in Schiller's Horen.]
　　FARTHER and farther away, alas! at each moment the vessel
　　Hastens, as onward it glides, cleaving the foam-cover'd flood!Long is the track plough'd up by the keel where dolphins are sporting,
　　Following fast in its rear, while it seems flying pursuit.All forebodes a prosperous voyage; the sailor with calmness
　　Leans 'gainst the sail, which alone all that is needed performs.Forward presses the heart of each seamen, like colours and streamers;
　　Backward one only is seen, mournfully fix'd near the mast,While on the blue tinged mountains, which fast are receding, he gazeth,
　　And as they sink in the sea, joy from his bosom departs.Vanish'd from thee, too, oh Dora, is now the vessel that robs thee
　　Of thine Alexis, thy friend,--ah, thy betrothed as well!Thou, too, art after me gazing in vain. Our hearts are still throbbing,
　　Though, for each other, yet ah! 'gainst one another no more.Oh, thou single moment, wherein I found life! thou outweighest
　　Every day which had else coldly from memory fled.'Twas in that moment alone, the last, that upon me descended
　　Life, such as deities grant, though thou perceived'st it not.Phoebus, in vain with thy rays dost thou clothe the ether in glory:
　　Thine all-brightening day hateful alone is to me.Into myself I retreat for shelter, and there, in the silence,
　　Strive to recover the time when she appear'd with each day.Was it possible beauty like this to see, and not feel it?
　　Work'd not those heavenly charms e'en on a mind dull as thine?Blame not thyself, unhappy one! Oft doth the bard an enigma
　　Thus propose to the throng, skillfully hidden in words.Each one enjoys the strange commingling of images graceful,
　　Yet still is wanting the word which will discover the sense.When at length it is found, the heart of each hearer is gladden'd,
　　And in the poem he sees meaning of twofold delight.Wherefore so late didst thou remove the bandage, oh Amor,
　　Which thou hadst placed o'er mine eyes,--wherefore remove it so late?Long did the vessel, when laden, lie waiting for favouring breezes,
　　'Till in kindness the wind blew from the land o'er the sea.Vacant times of youth! and vacant dreams of the future!
　　Ye all vanish, and nought, saving the moment, remains.Yes! it remains,--my joy still remains! I hold thee; my Dora,
　　And thine image alone, Dora, by hope is disclos'd.Oft have I seen thee go, with modesty clad, to the temple,
　　While thy mother so dear solemnly went by thy side.Eager  and nimble thou wert, in bearing thy fruit to the market,
　　Boldly the pail from the well didst thou sustain on thy head.Then was reveal'd thy neck, then seen thy shoulders so beauteous,
　　Then, before all things, the grace filling thy motions was seen.Oft have I fear'd that the pitcher perchance was in danger of falling,
　　Yet it ever remain'd firm on the circular cloth.Thus, fair neighbour, yes, thus I oft was wont to observe thee,
　　As on the stars I might gaze, as I might gaze on the moon,Glad indeed at the sight, yet feeling within my calm bosom
　　Not the remotest desire ever to call them mine own.Years thus fleeted away! Although our houses were only
　　Twenty paces apart, yet I thy threshold ne'er cross'd.Now by the fearful flood are we parted! Thou liest to Heaven,
　　Billow! thy beautiful blue seems to me dark as the night.All were now in movement; a boy to the house of my father
　　Ran at full speed and exclaim'd: "Hasten thee quick to the strandHoisted the sail is already, e'en now in the wind it is flutt'ring,
　　While the anchor they weigh, heaving it up from the sand;Come, Alexis, oh come!"--My worthy stout-hearted father
　　Press'd, with a blessing, his hand down on my curly-lock'd head,While my mother carefully reach'd me a newly-made bundle,
　　"Happy mayst thou return!" cried they--" both happy and rich!"Then I sprang away, and under my arm held the bundle,
　　Running along by the wall. Standing I found thee hard by,At the door of thy garden. Thou smilingly saidst then "Alexis!
　　Say, are yon boisterous crew going thy comrades to be?Foreign coasts will thou visit, and precious merchandise purchase,
　　Ornaments meet for the rich matrons who dwell in the town.Bring me, also, I praythee, a light chain; gladly I'll pay thee,
　　Oft have I wish'd to possess some stich a trinket as that."There I remain'd, and ask'd, as merchants are wont, with precision
　　After the form and the weight which thy commission should have.Modest, indeed, was the price thou didst name! I meanwhile was gazing
　　On thy neck which deserv'd ornaments worn but by queens.Loudly now rose the cry from the ship; then kindly thou spakest
　　"Take, I entreat thee, some fruit out of the garden, my friendTake the ripest oranges, figs of the whitest; the ocean
　　Beareth no fruit, and, in truth, 'tis not produced by each land."So I entered in. Thou pluckedst the fruit from the branches,
　　And the burden of gold was in thine apron upheld.Oft did I cry, Enough! But fairer fruits were still falling
　　Into the hand as I spake, ever obeying thy touch.Presently didst thou reached the arbour; there lay there a basket,
　　Sweet blooming myrtle trees wav'd, as we drew nigh, o'er our heads.Then thou began'st to arrange the fruit with skill and in silence:
　　First the orange, which lay heavy as though 'twere of gold,Then the yielding fig, by the slightest pressure disfigur'd,
　　And with myrtle the gift soon was both cover'd and grac'd.But I raised it not up. I stood. Our eyes met together,
　　And my eyesight grew dim, seeming obscured by a film,Soon I felt thy bosom on mine! Mine arm was soon twining
　　Round thy beautiful form; thousand times kiss'd I thy neck.On my shoulder sank thy head; thy fair arms, encircling,
　　Soon rendered perfect the ring knitting the rapturous pair.Amor's hands I felt: he press'd us together with ardour,
　　And, from the firmament clear, thrice did it thunder; then tearsStream'd from mine eyes in torrents, thou weptest, I wept, both were weeping,
　　And, 'mid our sorrow and bliss, even the world seem'd to die.Louder and louder they calI'd from the strand; my feet would no longer
　　Bear my weight, and I cried:--"Dora! and art thou not mine?""Thine forever!" thou gently didst say. Then the tears we were shedding
　　Seem'd to be wiped from our eyes, as by the breath of a god.Nearer was heard the cry "Alexis!" The stripling who sought me
　　Suddenly peep'd through the door. How he the basket snatch'd up!How he urged me away! how press'd I thy hand! Wouldst thou ask me
　　How the vessel I reach'd? Drunken I seem'd, well I know.Drunken my shipmates believed me, and so had pity upon me;
　　And as the breeze drove us on, distance the town soon obscur'd."Thine for ever!" thou, Dora, didst murmur; it fell on my senses
　　With the thunder of Zeus! while by the thunderer's throneStood his daughter, the Goddess of Love; the Graces were standing
　　Close by her side! so the bond beareth an impress divine!Oh then hasten, thou ship, with every favouring zephyr!
　　Onward, thou powerful keel, cleaving the waves as they foam!Bring me unto the foreign harbour, so that the goldsmith
　　May in his workshop prepare straightway the heavenly pledge!Ay, of a truth, the chain shall indeed be a chain, oh my Dora!
　　Nine times encircling thy neck, loosely around it entwin'dOther and manifold trinkets I'll buy thee; gold-mounted bracelets,
　　Richly and skillfully wrought, also shall grace thy fair hand.There shall the ruby and emerald vie, the sapphire so lovely
　　Be to the jacinth oppos'd, seeming its foil; while the goldHolds all the jewels together, in beauteous union commingled.
　　Oh, how the bridegroom exults, when he adorns his betroth'd!Pearls if I see, of thee they remind me; each ring that is shown me
　　Brings to my mind thy fair hand's graceful and tapering form.I will barter and buy; the fairest of all shalt thou choose thee,
　　Joyously would I devote all of the cargo to thee.Yet not trinkets and jewels alone is thy loved one procuring;
　　With them he brings thee whate'er gives to a housewife delight.Fine and woollen coverlets, wrought with an edging of purple,
　　Fit for a couch where we both, lovingly, gently may rest;Costly pieces of linen. Thou sittest and sewest, and clothest
　　Me, and thyself, and, perchance, even a third with it too.Visions of hope, deceive ye my heart! Ye kindly Immortals,
　　Soften this fierce-raging flame, wildly pervading my breast!Yet how I long to feel them again, those rapturous torments.
　　When, in their stead, care draws nigh, coldly and fearfully calm.Neither the Furies' torch, nor the hounds of hell with their harking
　　Awe the delinquent so much, down in the plains of despair,As by the motionless spectre I'm awed, that shows me the fair one
　　Far away: of a truth, open the garden-door stands!And another one cometh! For him the fruit, too, is falling,
　　And for him, also, the fig strengthening honey doth yield!Doth she entice him as well to the arbour? He follows? Oh, make me
　　Blind, ye Immortals! efface visions like this from my mind!Yes, she is but a maiden! And she who to one doth so quickly
　　Yield, to another ere long, doubtless, Will turn herself round.Smile not, Zeus, for this once, at an oath so cruelly broken!
　　Thunder more fearfully! Strike!--Stay--thy fierce lightnings withhold!Hurl at me thy quivering bolt! In the darkness of midnight
　　Strike with thy lightning this mast, make it a pitiful wreck!Scatter the planks all around, and give to the boisterous billows
　　All these wares, and let me be to the dolphins a preyNow, ye Muses, enough! In vain would ye strive to depicture
　　How, in a love-laden breast, anguish alternates with bliss.Ye cannot heal the wounds, it is true, that love hath inflicted;
　　Yet from you only proceeds, kindly ones, comfort and balm.

　　FATE AND SYMPATHY.
　　"NE'ER have I seen the market and streets so thoroughly empty!Still as the grave is the town, clear'd out! I verily fancyFifty at most of all our inhabitants still may be found there.People are so inquisitive! All are running and racingMerely to see the sad train of poor fellows driven to exile.Down to the causeway now building, the distance nearly a league is,And they thitherward rush, in the heat and the dust of the noonday.As for me, I had rather not stir from my place just to stare atWorthy and sorrowful fugitives, who, with what goods they can carry,Leaving their own fair land on the further side of the Rhine-stream,Over to us are crossing, and wander through the delightfulNooks of this fruitful vale, with all its twistings and windings.Wife, you did right well to bid our son go and meet them,Taking with him old linen, and something to eat and to drink too,Just to give to the poor; the rich are bound to befriend them.How he is driving along! How well he holds in the horses!Then the new little carriage looks very handsome; inside itFour can easily sit, besides the one on the coachbox.This time he is alone; how easily-turns it the corner!"Thus to his wife the host of the Golden Lion discoursed,Sitting at ease in the porch of his house adjoining the market.Then replied as follows the shrewd and sensible hostess"Father, I don't like giving old linen away, for I find itUseful in so many ways, 'tis not to he purchased for moneyJust when it's wanted. And yet to-day I gladly have givenMany excellent articles, shirts and covers and suchlike;For I have heard of old people and children walking half-naked.Will you forgive me, too, for having ransacked your presses?That grand dressing-gown, cover'd with Indian flowers all over,Made of the finest calico, lined with excellent flannel,I have despatch'd with the rest; 'tis thin, old, quite out of fashion."
　　But the worthy landlord only smiled, and then answer'dI shall dreadfully miss that ancient calico garment,Genuine Indian stuff! They're not to be had any longer.Well! I shall wear it no more. And your poor husband henceforwardAlways must wear a surtout, I suppose, or commonplace jacket,Always must put on his boots; good bye to cap and to slippers!"
　　"See," continued his wife, "a few are already returningWho have seen the procession, which long ago must have pass'd by.See how dusty their shoes are, and how their faces are glowingEach one carries a handkerchief, wiping the sweat from his forehead.I, for one, wouldn't hurry and worry myself in such weatherMerely to see such a sight! I'm certain to hear all about it."
　　And the worthy father, speaking with emphasis, added"Such fine weather seldom lasts through the whole of the harvestAnd we're bringing the fruit home, just as the hay we brought lately,Perfectly dry; the sky is clear, no cloud's in the heavens,And the whole day long delicious breezes are blowing.Splendid weather I call it! The corn already too ripe is,And to-morrow begin we to gather the plentiful harvest."
　　Whilst he was thus discoursing, the number of men and of womenCrossing the market and going towards home kept ever increasing;And there return'd amongst others, bringing with him his daughters,On the other side of the market, their prosperous neighbour,Going full speed to his newbuilt house, the principal merchant,Riding inside an open carriage (in Landau constructed).All the streets were alive; for the town, though small, was well peopled,Many a factory throve there, and many a business also.
　　Long sat the excellent couple under the doorway, exchangingMany a passing remark on the people who happen'd to pass them.Presently thus to her husband exclaim'd the good-natured hostess"See! Yon comes the minister; with him is walking the druggist:They'll be able to give an account of all that has happen'd,What they witness'd, and many a sight I fear which was painful."
　　Both of them came in a friendly manner, and greeted the couple,Taking their seats on the wooden benches under the doorway,Shaking the dust from their feet, their handkerchiefs using to fan them.Presently, after exchanging reciprocal greetings, the druggistOpen'd his mouth, and almost peevishly vented his feelings"What strange creatures men are! They all resemble each other,All take pleasure in staring, when troubles fall on their neighbours.Ev'ry one runs to see the flames destroying a dwelling,Or a poor criminal led in terror and shame to the scaffold.All the town has been out to gaze at the sorrowing exiles,None of them bearing in mind that a like misfortune hereafter,Possibly almost directly, may happen to be their own portion.I can't pardon such levity; yet 'tis the nature of all men."Thereupon rejoin'd the noble and excellent pastor,He, the charm of the town, in age scarce more than a stripling:--(He was acquainted with life, and knew the wants of his hearers,Fully convinced of the worth of the Holy Scriptures, whose missionIs to reveal man's fate, his inclinations to fathom;He was also well read in the best of secular writings.)"I don't like to find fault with any innocent impulseWhich in the mind of man Dame Nature has ever implanted;For what reason and intellect ne'er could accomplish, is oftenDone by some fortunate, quite irresistible instinct within him.If mankind were never by curiosity driven,Say, could they e'er have found out for themselves the wonderful mannerThings in the world range in order? For first they Novelty look for,Then with untiring industry seek to discover the Useful,Lastly they yearn for the Good, which makes them noble and worthy.All through their youth frivolity serves as their joyous companion,Hiding the presence of danger, and. swiftly effacing the tracesCaused by misfortune and grief, as soon as their onslaught is over.Truly the man's to be praised who, as years roll onward, developsOut of such glad disposition an intellect settled and steady,--Who, in good fortune as well as misfortune, strives zealously, nobly;For what is Good he brings forth, replacing whatever is injured."Then in a friendly voice impatiently spoke thus the hostess:--"Tell us what have you seen; I am eagerly longing to hear it."
　　Then with emphasis answer'd the druggist:--" The terrible storiesTold me to-day will serve for a long time to make me unhappy.Words would fail to describe the manifold pictures of mis'ry.Far in the distance saw we the dust, before we descendedDown to the meadows; the rising hillocks hid the processionLong from our eyes, and little could we distinguish about it.When, however, we reach'd the road that winds thro' the valley,Great was the crowd and the noise of the emigrants mix'd with the waggons.We unhappily saw poor fellows passing in numbers,Some of them showing how bitter the sense of their sorrowful flight was,Some with a feeling of joy at saving their lives in a hurry.Sad was the sight of the manifold goods and chattels pertainingUnto a well-managed house, which the careful owner's accustom'dEach in its proper position to place, and in regular order,Always ready for use, for all are wanted and useful.--Sad was the sight of them now, on many a waggon and barrowHeap'd in thorough confusion, and hurriedly huddled together.Over a cupboard was placed a sieve and a coverlet woollen;Beds in the kneeding troughs lay, and linen over the glasses.Ah! and the danger appear'd to rob the men of their senses,Just as in our great fire of twenty years ago happen'd,When what was worthless they saved, and left all the best things behind them.So on the present occasion with heedless caution they carriedMany valueless chattels, o'erlading the cattle and horses,--Common old boards and barrels, a birdcage next to a goosepen.Women and children were gasping beneath the weight of their bundles,Baskets and tubs full of utterly useless articles, bearing.(Man is always unwilling the least of his goods to abandon.)Thus on its dusty way advanced the crowded procession,All in hopeless confusion. First one, whose cattle were weaker,Fain would slowly advance, while others would eagerly hasten.Then there arose a scream of half-crush'd women and children,And a lowing of cattle, with yelping of dogs intermingled,And a wailing of aged and sick, all sitting and shaking,Ranged in their beds on the top of the waggon too-heavily laden.Next some lumbering wheel, push'd out of the track by the pressure,Went to the edge of the roadway; the vehicle fell in the ditch then,Rolling right over, and throwing, in falling, the men who were in itFar in the field, screaming loudly, their persons however uninjured.Then the boxes roll'd off and tumbled close to the waggon.Those who saw them failing full surely expected to see themSmash'd to pieces beneath the weight of the chests and the presses.So the waggon lay broken, and those that it carried were helpless,For the rest of the train went on, and hurriedly pass'd them,Thinking only of self, and carried away by the current.So we sped to the spot, and found the sick and the agedWho, when at home and in bed, could scarcely endure their sad ailments,Lying there on the ground, all sighing and groaning in anguish,Stifled by clouds of dust, and scorch'd by the fierce sun of summer.
　　Then replied in tones of compassion the sensitive landlordHermann I trust will find them and give them refreshment and clothing.I should unwillingly see them: I grieve at the eight of such sorrow.Touch'd by the earliest news of the sad extent of the suffering,Hastily sent we a trifle from out of our superabundance,Just to comfort a few, and then our minds were more easy.Now let us cease to discourse on such a sorrowful subject,For men's hearts are easily overshadow'd by terror,And by care, more odious far to me than misfortune.Now let us go to a cooler place, the little back-parlour;There the sun never shines, and the walls are so thick that the hot airNever can enter; and mother shall forthwith bring us a glass eachFull of fine Eighty-three, well fitted to drive away trouble.This is a bad place for drinking; the flies will hum round the glasses."So they all went inside, enjoying themselves in the coolness.Then in a well-cut flask the mother carefully brought themSome of that clear good wine, upon a bright metal waiterWith those greenish rummers, the fittingest goblets for Rhine wine.So the three sat together, around the glistening polish'dCircular large brown table-膐n massive feet it was planted.Merrily clink'd together the glasses of host and of pastor,But the other one thoughtfully held his glass without moving,And in friendly fashion the host thus ask'd him to join them:--
　　"Drink, good neighbour, I pray! A merciful God has protectedUs in the past from misfortune, and will protect us in future.All must confess that since He thought fit to severely chastise us,When that terrible fire occurr'd, He has constantly bless'd us.And watch'd over us constantly, just as man is accustom'dHis eye's precious apple to guard, that dearest of members.Shall He not for the future preserve us, and be our Protector?For 'tis in danger we learn to appreciate duly His Goodness.This so flourishing town, which He built again from its ashesBy the industrious hands of its burghers, and bless'd it so richly,Will He again destroy it, and render their toil unavailing?"
　　Cheerfully answer'd the excellent pastor, in accents of mildness"Steadfastly cling to this faith, and cherish such worthy opinions;In good fortune they'll make you prudent, and then in misfortuneWell-grounded hopes they'll supply, and furnish you true consolation."
　　Then continued the host, with thoughts full of manhood and wisdom"Oft have I greeted with wonder the rolling flood of the Rhine stream,When, on my business trav'lling, I've once more come to its borders.Grand has it ever appear'd, exalting my feelings and senses;But I could never imagine that soon its beautiful marginInto a wall would be turn'd, to keep the French from our country,And its wide-spreading bed a ditch to hinder and check them.So by Nature we're guarded, we're guarded by valorous Germans,And by the Lord we're guarded; who then would foolishly tremble?Weary the combatants are, and all things indicate peace soon;And when at length the long-expected festival's holdenHere in our church, and the bells chime in with the organ in chorus,And the trumpets are blowing, the noble Te Deum upraising,Then on that selfsame day I fain would see, my good pastor,Our dear Hermann kneel with his bride at the altar before you,And the glad festival held through the length and breadth of the countryWill henceforward to me be a glad anniversary also!But I am grieved to observe that the youth, who is always so activeWhen he is here at home, abroad is so slow and so timid.Little at any time cares he to mix with the rest of the people;Yes, he even avoids young maidens' society ever,And the frolicsome dance, that great delight of young people."
　　Thus he spake, and then listen'd. The sound of the stamping of horsesDrawing nearer was heard; and then the roll of the carriage,Which, with impetuous speed, now thunder'd under the gateway.-----II.  TERPSICHORE.
　　HERMANN.
　　THEN when into the room the well-built son made his entry,Straightway with piercing glances the minister eyed him intently,And with carefulness watch'd his looks and the whole of his bearing,With an inquiring eye which easily faces decyphers;Then he smiled, and with cordial words address'd him as follows"How you are changed in appearance, my friend! I never have seen youHalf so lively before; your looks are thoroughly cheerful.You have return'd quite joyous and merry. You've doubtless dividedAll of the presents amongst the poor, their blessings receiving."
　　Then in calm accents replied the son, with gravity speaking"Whether I've laudably acted, I know not; I follow'd the impulseOf my own heart, as now I'll proceed to describe with exactness.Mother, you rummaged so long, in looking over old pieces,And in making your choice, that 'twas late when the bundle was ready,And the wine and the beer were slowly and carefully pack'd up.When I at length emerged at the gate, and came on the highway,Streams of citizens met I returning, with women and children,For the train of the exiles had long disappear'd in the distance.So I quicken'd my pace, and hastily drove to the villageWhere I had heard that to-night to rest and to sleep they intended.Well, as I went on my way, the newly-made causeway ascending,Suddenly saw I a waggon, of excellent timber constructed,Drawn by a couple of oxen, the best and the strongest of foreign.Close beside it there walk'd, with sturdy footsteps, a maiden,Guiding the two strong beasts with a long kind of staff, which with skill sheKnew how to use, now driving, and now restraining their progress.When the maiden observed me, she quietly came near the horses,And address'd me as follows:--'Our usual condition, believe me,Is not so sad as perchance you might judge from our present appearance.I am not yet accustom'd to ask for alms from a stranger,Who so often but gives, to rid himself of a beggar.But I'm compell'd to speak by necessity. Here on the straw nowLies the lately-confined poor wife of a wealthy landowner,Whom with much trouble I managed to save with oxen and waggon.We were late in arriving, and scarcely with life she escaped.Now the newly-born child in her arms is lying, all naked,And our friends will be able to give them but little assistance,E'en if in the next village, to which to-night we are going,We should still find them, although I fear they have left it already.If you belong to the neighbourhood, any available linenThese poor people will deem a most acceptable present.
　　"Thus she spake, and wearily raised herself the pale patientUp from the straw and gazed upon me, while thus I made answer'Oft doth a heavenly spirit whisper to kind-hearted people,So that they feel the distress o'er their poorer brethren impending;For my mother, your troubles foreboding, gave me a bundleReady prepared for relieving the wants of those who were naked.'Then I loosen'd the knots of the cord, and the dressing-gown gave herWhich belong'd to my father, and gave her some shirts and some linen,And she thank'd me with joy and said:--'The fortunate know notHow 'tis that miracles happen; we only discover in sorrowGod's protecting finger and hand, extended to beckonGood men to good. May your kindness to us by Him be requited.'And I saw the poor patient joyfully handling the linen,Valuing most of all the soft flannel, the dressing-gown lining.Then the maid thus address'd her:--'Now let us haste to the villageWhere our friends are resting, to-night intending to sleep thereThere I will straightway attend to what e'er for the infant is needed.'Then she saluted me too, her thanks most heartily giving,Drove the oxen, the waggon went on. I lingerd behind them,Holding my horses rein'd back, divided between two opinions,Whether to hasten ahead, reach the village, the viands distribute'Mongst the rest of the people, or give them forthwith to the maiden,So that she might herself divide them amongst them with prudenceSoon I made up my mind, and follow'd after her softly,Overtook her without delay, and said to her quickly'Maiden, it was not linen alone that my mother providedAnd in the carriage placed, as clothing to give to the naked,But she added meat, and many an excellent drink too;And I have got quite a stock stow'd away in the boot of the carriage.Well, I have taken a fancy the rest of the gifts to depositIn your hands, and thus fulfil to the best my commission;You will divide them with prudence, whilst I my fate am obeying.'Then the maiden replied:--'With faithfulness I will distributeAll your gifts, and the needy shall surely rejoice at your bounty.'Thus she spake, and I hastily open'd the boot of the carriage,Took out the hams (full heavy they were) and took out the bread-stuffs,Flasks of wine and beer, and handed the whole of them over.Gladly would I have given her more, but empty the boot was.Straightway she pack'd them away at the feet of the patient, and forthwithStarted again, whilst I hasten'd back to the town with my horses."
　　Then when Hermann had ended his story, the garrulous neighbourOpen'd his mouth and exclaim'd:--"I only deem the man happyWho lives alone in his house in these days of flight and confusion,Who has neither wife nor children cringing beside himI feel happy at present; I hate the title of father;Care of children and wife in these days would be a sad drawback.Often have I bethought me of flight, and have gather'd togetherAll that I deem most precious, the antique gold and the jewelsWorn by my late dear mother, not one of which has been sold yet.Much indeed is left out, that is not so easily carried.Even the herbs and the roots, collected with plenty of trouble,I should he sorry to lose, though little in value they may be.If the dispenser remains, I shall leave my house in good spiritsIf my ready money is saved, and my body, why trulyAll is saved, for a bachelor easily flies when 'tis needed."
　　"Neighbour," rejoin'd forthwith young Hermann, with emphasis speaking"Altogether I differ, and greatly blame your opinions.Can that man be deem'd worthy, who both in good and ill fortuneThinks alone of himself, and knows not the secret of sharingSorrows and joys with others, and feels no longing to do so?I could more easily now than before determine to marryMany an excellent maiden needs a husband's protection,Many a man a cheerful wife, when sorrow's before him."Smilingly said then the father:--"I'm pleas'd to hear what you're saying,Words of such wisdom have seldom been utter'd by you in my presence.
　　Then his good mother broke in, in her turn, with vivacity speaking"Son, you are certainly right. We parents set the example.'Twas not in time of pleasure that we made choice of each other,And 'twas the saddest of hours, that knitted us closely together.Monday morning,--how well I remember! the very day afterThat most terrible fire occurr'd which burnt down the borough,Twenty years ago now; the day, like to-day, was a Sunday,Hot and dry was the weather, and little available water.All the inhabitants, clothed in their festival garments, were walking,Scatter'd about in the inns and the mills of the neighbouring hamlets.At one end of the town the fire broke out, and the flames ranHastily all through the streets, impell'd by the draught they created.And the barns were consumed, where all the rich harvest was gather'dAnd all the streets as far as the market; the dwelling house alsoOf my father hard by was destroy'd, as likewise was this one.Little indeed could we save; I sat the sorrowful night throughOn the green of the town, protecting the beds and the boxes.Finally sleep overtook me, and when by the cool breeze of morningWhich dies away when the sun arises I was awaken'd,Saw I the smoke and the glow, and the half-consumed walls and the chimneys.Then my heart was sorely afflicted; but soon in his gloryRose the sun more brilliant than ever, my spirits reviving.Then in haste I arose, impell'd the site to revisitWhere our dwelling had stood, to see if the chickens were livingWhich I especially loved; for childlike I still was by nature.But when over the ruins of courtyard and house I was climbing,Which still smoked, and saw my dwelling destroy'd and deserted,You came up on the other side, the ruins exploring.You had a horse shut up in his stall; the still-glowing raftersOver it lay, and rubbish, and nought could be seen of the creature.Over against each other we stood, in doubt and in sorrow,For the wall had fallen which used to sever our courtyards;And you grasp'd my hand, addressing me softly as follows'Lizzy, what here are you doing? Away! Your soles you are burning,For the rubbish is hot, and is scorching my boots which are thicker.'Then you lifted me up, and carried me off through your courtyard.There still stood the gateway before the house, with its arch'd roof,Just as it now is standing, the only thing left remaining.And you sat me down and kiss'd me, and I tried to stop you,But you presently said, with kindly words full of meaning'See, my house is destroy'd! Stop here and help me to build it,I in return will help to rebuild the house of your father.'I understood you not, till you sent to my father your mother,And ere long our marriage fulfilid the troth we soon plighted.Still to this day I remember with pleasure the half-consumed rafters,Still do I see the sun in all his majesty rising,For on that day I gain'd my husband; the son of my youth tooGained I during that earliest time of the wild desolation.Therefore commend I you, Hermann, for having with confidence guilelessTurn'd towards marriage your thoughts in such a period of mourning,And for daring to woo in war and over the ruins.--"
　　Then the father straightway replied, with eagerness speaking:--"Sensible is your opinion, and true is also the storyWhich you have told us, good mother, for so did ev'rything happen.But what is better is better. 'Tis not the fortune of all menAll their life and existence to find decided beforehand;All are not doom'd to such troubles as we and others have suffer'd.O, how happy is he whose careful father and motherHave a house ready to give him, which he can successfully manage!All beginnings are hard, and most so the landlords profession.Numberless things a man must have, and ev'rything dailyDearer becomes, so he needs to scrape together more money.So I am hoping that you, dear Hermann, will shortly be bringingHome to us a bride possessing an excellent dowry,For a worthy husband deserves a girl who is wealthy,And 'tis a capital thing for the wish'd-for wife to bring with herPlenty of suitable articles stow'd in her baskets and boxes.Not in vain for years does the mother prepare for her daughterStocks of all kinds of linen, both finest and strongest in texture;Not in vain do god-parents give them presents of silver,Or the father lay by in his desk a few pieces of money.For she hereafter will gladden, with all her goods and possessions,That happy youth who is destined from out of all others to choose her.Yes! I know how pleasant it makes a house for a young wife,When she finds her own property placed in the rooms and the kitchen,And when she herself has cover'd the bed and the table.Only well-to-do brides should be seen in a house, I consider,For a poor one is sure at last to be scorn'd by her husband,And he'll deem her a jade who as jade first appear'd with her bundle.Men are always unjust, but moments of love are but transient.Yes, my Hermann, you greatly would cheer the old age of your fatherIf you soon would bring home a daughter-in-law to console me,Out of the neighbourhood too,--yes, out of yon dwelling, the green one!Rich is the man, in truth his trade and his manufacturesMake him daily richer, for when does a merchant not prosper?He has only three daughters; the whole of his wealth they'll inherit.True the eldest's already engaged; but then there's the second,And the third, who still (not for long) may be had for the asking.Had I been in your place, I should not till this time have waited;Bring home one of the girls, as I brought your mother before you.
　　Then, with modesty, answer'd the son his impetuous father"Truly my wish was, like yours, to marry one of the daughtersOf our neighbour. We all, in fact, were brought up together,Sported in youthful days near the fountain adjoining the market,And from the rudeness of boys I often managed to save them.But those days have long pass'd the maidens grew up, and with reasonStop now at home and avoid the rougher pastimes of childhood.Well brought up with a vengeance they are! To please you, I sometimesWent to visit them, just for the sake of olden acquaintanceBut I was never much pleased at holding intercourse with them,For they were always finding fault, and I had to bear itFirst my coat was too long, the cloth too coarse, and the colourFar too common, my hair was cut and curl'd very badly.I at last was thinking of dressing myself like the shop-boys,Who are accustom'd on Sundays to show off their persons up yonder,And round whose coats in summer half-silken tatters are hanging.But ere long I discover'd they only intended to fool meThis was very annoying, my pride was offended, but more stillFelt I deeply wounded that they so mistook the good feelingsWhich I cherish'd towards them, especially Minnie, the youngest.Well, I went last Easter, politely to pay them a visit,And I wore the new coat now hanging up in the closet,And was frizzled and curld, like all the rest of the youngsters.When I enter'd, they titter'd; but that didn't very much matter.Minnie sat at the piano, the father was present amongst them,Pleased with his daughter's singing, and quite in a jocular humour.Little could I understand of the words in the song she was singing,But I constantly heard of Pamina, and then of Tamino,*
　　(* Characters In Mozart's Zauberflote.)And I fain would express my opinion; so when she had ended,I ask'd questions respecting the text, and who were the persons.All were silent and smiled; but presently answer'd the father'Did you e'er happen, my friend, to hear of Eve or of Adam?'Then no longer restrain'd they themselves, the girls burst out laughing,All the boys laugh'd loudly, the old man's sides appear'd splitting.In my confusion I let my hat fall down, and the titt'ringLasted all the time the singing and playing continued.Then I hasten'd home, ashamed and full of vexation,Hung up my coat in the closet, and put my hair in disorderWith my fingers, and swore ne'er again to cross o'er their threshold.And I'm sure I was right; for they are all vain and unloving.And I hear they're so rude as to give me the nickname Tamino."Then the mother rejoin'd:--"You're wrong, dear Hermann, to harbourAngry feelings against the children, for they are but children.Minnie's an excellent girl, and has a tenderness for you;Lately she ask'd how you were. Indeed, I wish you would choose her!"
　　Then the son thoughtfully answer'd:--"I know not why, but the fact isMy annoyance has graven itself in my mind, and hereafterI could not bear at the piano to see her, or list to her singing."
　　But the father sprang up, and said, in words full of anger"Little comfort you give me, in truth! I always have said it,When you took pleasure in horses, and cared for nothing but fieldwork;That which the servants of prosperous people perform as their duty,You yourself do; meanwhile the father his son must dispense with,Who in his honour was wont to court the rest of the townsfolk.Thus with empty hopes your mother early deceived me,When your reading, and writing, and learning at school ne'er succeededLike the rest of the boys, and so you were always the lowest.This all comes from a youth not possessing a due sense of honour,And not having the spirit to try and raise his position.Had my father but cared for me, as I have for you, sir,Sent me to school betimes, and given me proper instructors,I should not merely have been the host of the famed Golden Lion."
　　But the son arose, and approach'd the doorway in silence,Slowly, and making no noise: but then the father in dudgeonAfter him shouted:--"Be off! I know you're an obstinate fellow!Go and look after the business; else I shall scold you severely;But don't fancy I'll ever allow you to bring home in triumphAs my daughter-in-law any boorish impudent hussy.Long have I lived in the world, and know how to manage most people,Know how to entertain ladies and gentlemen, so that they leave meIn good humour, and know how to flatter a stranger discreetly.But my daughter-in-law must have useful qualities also,And be able to soften my manifold cares and vexations.She must also play on the piano, that all the best peopleHere in the town may take pleasure in often coming to see us,As in the house of our neighbour the merchant happens each Sunday."Softly the son at these words raised the latch, and left the apartment.-----III.

　　THUS did the prudent son escape from the hot conversation,But the father continued precisely as he had begun itWhat is not in a man can never come out of him, surely!Never, I fear, shall I see fulfill'd my dearest of wishes,That my son should be unlike his father, but better.What would be the fate of a house or a town, if its inmatesDid not all take pride in preserving, renewing, improving,As we are taught by the age, and by the wisdom of strangers?Man is not born to spring out of the ground, just like a mere mushroom,And to rot away soon in the very place that produced him!Leaving behind him no trace of what he has done in his lifetime.One can judge by the look of a house of the taste of its master,As on ent'ring a town, one can judge the authorities' fitness.For where the towers and walls are falling, where in the ditchesDirt is collected, and dirt in every street is seen lying,Where the stones come out of their groove, and are not replaced there,Where the beams are rotting, and vainly the houses are waitingNew supports; that town is sure to be wretchedly managed.For where order and cleanliness reign not supreme in high places,Then to dirt and delay the citizens soon get accustom'd,Just as the beggar's accustom'd to wear his cloths full of tatters.Therefore I often have wish'd that Hermann would start on his travelsEre he's much older, and visit at any rate Strasburg and Frankfort,And that pleasant town, Mannheim, so evenly built and so cheerful.He who has seen such large and cleanly cities rests neverTill his own native town, however small, he sees better'd.Do not all strangers who visit us praise our well-mended gateways,And the well-whited tower, the church so neatly repair'd too?Do not all praise our pavements? Our well-arranged cover'd-in conduits,Always well furnish'd with water, utility blending with safety,So that a fire, whenever it happens, is straightway extinguish'd,--Is not this the result of that conflagration so dreadful?Six times in Council I superintended the town's works, receivingHearty thanks and assistance from every well-disposed burgher.How I design'd, follow'd up, and ensured the completion of measuresWorthy men had projected, and afterwards left all unfinish'd!Finally, every man in the Council took pleasure in working.All put forth their exertions, and now they have finally settledThat new highway to make, which will join our town with the main road.But I am greatly afraid that the young generation won't act thus;Some on the one hand think only of pleasure and trumpery dresses,Others wont stir out of doors, and pass all their time by the fireside,And our Hermann, I fear, will always be one of this last sort."
　　Forthwith to him replied the excellent sensible mother"Father, you're always unjust whenever you speak of your son, andThat is the least likely way to obtain your wishes' fulfillment,For we cannot fashion our children after our fancy.We must have them and love them, as God has given them to us,Bring them up for the best, and let each do as he listeth.One has one kind of gift, another possesses another,Each one employs them, and each in turn in his separate fashionGood and happy becomes. My Hermann shall not be upbraided,For I know that he well deserves the wealth he'll inherit;He'll be an excellent landlord, a pattern to burghers and peasants,And, as I clearly foresee, by no means the last in the Council.But with your blame and reproaches, you daily dishearten him sadly,As you have done just now, and make the poor fellow unhappy."
　　Then she left the apartment, and after her son hasten'd quickly,Hoping somewhere to find him, and with her words of affectionGladden his heart, for he, the excellent son, well deserved it.Smilingly, when she had closed the door, continued the father"What a wonderful race of people are women and children.All of them fain would do whatever pleases their fancy,And we're only alow'd to praise them and flatter them freely.Once for all there's truth in the ancient proverb which tells us:He who moves not forward, goes backward! a capital saying!"
　　Speaking with much circumspection, the druggist made answer as follows"What you say, good neighbour, is certainly true, and my plan isAlways to think of improvement, provided tho' new, 'tis not costly.But what avails it in truth, unless one has plenty of money,Active and fussy to he, improving both inside and outside?Sadly confined are the means of a burgher; e'en when he knows it,Little that's good he is able to do, his purse is too narrow,And the sum wanted too great; and so he is always prevented.I have had plenty of schemes! but then I was terribly frighten'dAt the expense, especially during a time of such danger.Long had my house smiled upon me, decked out in modish exterior,Long had my windows with large panes of glass resplendently glitterd.Who can compete with a merchant, however, who, rolling in riches,Also knows the manner in which what is best can be purchased?Only look at the house up yonder, the new one: how handsomeLooks the stucco of those white scrolls on the green-colour'd panels!Large are the plates of the windows--how shining and brilliant the panes are,Quite eclipsing the rest of the houses that stand in the market!Yet at the time of the fire, our two were by far the most handsome,Mine at the sign of the Angel, and yours at the old Golden Lion.Then my garden was famous throughout the whole country, and strangersUsed to stop as they pass'd and peep through my red-colourd palingsAt my beggars of stone, and at my dwarfs, which were painted,He to whom I gave coffee inside my beautiful grotto,Which, alas! is now cover'd with dust and tumbling to pieces,Used to rejoice in the colour'd glimmering light of the mussels,Ranged in natural order around it, and connoisseurs evenUsed with dazzled eyes to gaze at the spars and the coral.Then, in the drawing-room, people look'd with delight on the painting,Where the prim ladies and gentlemen walked in the garden demurely,And with pointed fingers presented the flowers, and held them.Ah, if only such things were now to be seen! Little care INow to go out; for everything needs to be alter'd and tasteful,As it is call'd; and white are the benches of wood and the palings;All things are simple and plain; and neither carving not gildingNow are employ'd, and foreign timber is now all the fashion.I should be only too pleased to possess some novelty also,So as to march with the times, and my household furniture alter.But we all are afraid to make the least alteration,For who is able to pay the present charges of workmen?Lately a fancy possess'd me, the angel Michael, whose figureHangs up over my shop, to treat to a new coat of gilding,And the terrible Dragon, who round his feet is entwining;But I have left him all brown; as he is; for the cost quite alarm'd me."-----IV. EUTERPE.
　　MOTHER AND SON.
　　THUS the men discoursed together; and meanwhile the motherWent in search of her son,--at first in front of the dwellingOn the bench of stone, for he was accustom'd to sit there.When she found him not there, she went to look in the stable,Thinking perchance he was feeding his splendid horses, the stallionsWhich he had bought when foals, and which he entrusted to no one.But the servant inform'd her that he had gone to the garden.Then she nimbly strode across the long double courtyard,Left the stables behind, and the barns all made of good timber,Enter'd the garden which stretch'd far away to the walls of the borough,Walk'd across it, rejoicing to see how all things were growing,Carefully straighten'd the props, on which the apple-tree's branches,Heavily loaded, reposed, and the weighty boughs of the pear-tree,Took a few caterpillars from off the strong-sprouting cabbage;For a bustling woman is never idle one moment.In this manner she came to the end of the long-reaching garden,Where was the arbour all cover'd with woodbine: she found not her son there,Nor was he to be seen in any part of the garden.But she found on the latch the door which out of the arbourThrough the wall of the town had been made by special permissionDuring their ancestor's time, the worthy old burgomaster.So she easily stepp'd across the dry ditch at the spot whereOn the highway abutted their well-inclosed excellent vineyard.Rising steeply upwards, its face tow'rd the sun turn'd directly.Up the hill she proceeded, rejoicing, as farther she mounted,At the size of the grapes, which scarcely were hid by the foliage.Shady and well-cover'd in, the middle walk at the top was,Which was ascended by steps of rough flat pieces constructed.And within it were hanging fine chasselas and muscatels also,And a reddish-blue grape, of quite an exceptional bigness,All with carefulness planted, to give to their guests after dinner.But with separate stems the rest of the vineyard was planted,Smaller grapes producing, from which the finest wine made is.So she constantly mounted, enjoying in prospect the autumn.And the festal day, when the neighbourhood met with rejoicing,Picking and treading the grapes, and putting the must in the wine-vats,Every corner and nook resounding at night with the fireworks,Blazing and cracking away, due honour to pay to the harvest.But she uneasy became, when she in vain had been callingTwice and three times her son, and when the sole answer that reach'd herCame from the garrulous echo which out of the town towers issued.Strange it appear'd to have to seek him; he never went far off,(As he before had told her) in order to ward off all sorrowFrom his dear mother, and her forebodings of coming disaster.But she still was expecting upon the highway to find him,For the doors at the bottom, like those at the top, of the vineyardStood wide open; and so at length she enter'd the broad fieldWhich, with its spreading expanse, o'er the whole of the hill's back extended.On their own property still she proceeded, greatly rejoicingAt their own crops, and at the corn which nodded so bravely,Over the whole field in golden majesty waving.Then on the border between the fields she follow'd the footpath,Keeping her eye on the pear-tree fix'd, the big one, which standingPerch'd by itself on the top of the hill, their property bounded.Who had planted it, no one knew; throughout the whole countryFar and wide was it visible; noted also its fruit was.Under its shadow the reaper ate his dinner at noonday,And the herdsman was wont to lie, when tending his cattle.Benches made of rough stones and of turf were placed all about it.And she was not mistaken; there sat her Hermann and restedOn his arm he was leaning, and seem'd to be looking cross countryTow'rds the mountains beyond; his back was turn'd to his mother.Softly creeping up, she lightly tapp'd on his shoulder;And he hastily turn'd; she saw that his eyes full of tears were.
　　"Mother," he said in confusion:--"You greatly surprise me!" and quicklyWiped he away his tears, the noble and sensitive youngster."What! You are weeping, my son?" the startled mother continued"That is indeed unlike you! I never before saw you crying!Say, what has sadden'd your heart? What drives you to sit here all lonelyUnder the shade of the pear-tree? What is it that makes you unhappy?"
　　Then the excellent youth collected himself, and made answer"Truly that man can have no heart, but a bosom of iron,Who no sympathy feels for the wants of unfortunate exiles;He has no sense in his head who, in times of such deep tribulation,Has no concern for himself or for his country's well-being.What I to-day have seen and heard, has stirr'd up my feelings;Well, I have come up here, and seen the beautiful, spreadingLandscape, which in fruitful hills to our sight is presented,Seen the golden fruit of the sheaves all nodding together,And a plentiful crop of fruit, full garners foreboding.But, alas, how near is the foe! By the Rhine's flowing watersWe are protected indeed; but what are rivers and mountainsTo such a terrible nation, which hurries along like a tempest!For they summon together the young and the old from all quarters,Rushing wildly along, while the multitude little is caringEven for death; when one falls, his place is straight fill'd by another,Ah! and can Germans dare to remain at home in their dwellings,Thinking perchance to escape from the widely-threat'ning disaster?Dearest mother, I tell you that I to-day am quite sorryThat I was lately excused, when they selected the fightersOut of the townfolk. 'Tis true I'm an only son, and more-overLarge is our inn, and our business also is very important;Were it not better however for me to fight in the vanguardOn the frontier, than here to await disaster and bondage?Yes, my spirit has told me, and in my innermost bosomFeel I courage and longing to live and die for my country,And to others to set an example worthy to follow.Oh, of a truth, if the strength of the German youths was collectedOn the frontier, all bound by a vow not to yield to the stranger,He on our noble soil should never set foot, or be ableUnder our eyes to consume the fruits of the land, or to issueOrders unto our men, or despoil our women and maidens!See, good mother, within my inmost heart I've determinedSoon and straightway to do what seems to me right and becoming;For the man who thinks long, not always chooses what best is.See, I will not return to the house, but will go from here straightwayInto the town, and there will place at the fighters' disposalThis stout arm and this heart, to serve, as I best can, my country.Then let my father say whether feelings of honour are stirringIn my bosom or not, and whether I yearn to mount upwards."
　　Then with significance answer'd his good and sensible mother,Shedding tears in silence, which easily rose in her eyelids:--"Son, what has wrought so strange a change in your temper and feelings,That you freely and openly speak to your mother no longer,As you till yesterday did, nor tell her truly your wishes?If another had heard you speaking, he doubtless would praise youHighly, and deem your new resolution as worthy of honour,Being deceived by your words, and by your manner of speaking.I however can only blame you. I know you much better.You are concealing your heart, and very diff'rent your thoughts are;For I am sure you care not at all for drum and for trumpet,Nor, to please the maidens, care you to wear regimentals.For, though brave you may be, and gallant, your proper vocationIs to remain at home, the property quietly watching.Therefore tell me truly: What means this sudden decision?"
　　Earnestly answer'd the son:--"You are wrong, dear-mother, one day isUnlike another. The youth soon ripens into his manhood.Ofttimes he ripens better to action in silence than livingThat tumultuous noisy life which ruins so many.And though silent I have been, and am, a heart has been fashion'dInside my bosom, which hates whatever unfair and unjust is,And I am able right well to discriminate secular matters.Work moreover my arms and my feet has mightily strengthen'd.All that I tell you is true; I boldly venture to say so.And yet, mother, you blame me with reason; you've caught me employingWords that are only half true, and that serve to conceal my true feelings.For I must need confess, it is not the advent of dangerCalls me away from my father's house, nor a resolute purposeUseful to be to my country, and dreaded to be by the foeman.Words alone it was that I utter'd,--words only intendedThose deep feelings to hide, which within my breast are contending.And now leave me, my mother! For as in my bosom I cherishWishes that are but vain, my life will be to no purpose.For I know that the Unit who makes a self-sacrifice, onlyInjures himself, unless all endeavour the Whole to accomplish."
　　"Now continue," replied forthwith his sensible mother:--"Tell me all that has happen'd, the least as w'ell as the greatestMen are always hasty, and only remember the last thing,And the hasty are easily forced from the road by obstructions.But a woman is skillful, and full of resources, and scorns notBye-roads to traverse when needed, well-skill'd to accomplish her purpose.Tell me then all, and why you are stirr'd by such violent feelingsMore than I ever have seen, while the blood is boiling within you,And from your eyes the tears against your will fain would fall now."
　　Then the youth gave way to his sorrow, and burst into weeping,Weeping aloud on the breast of his mother, and softly replying"Truly, my father's words to-day have wounded me sadly,Never have I deserved at his hands such treatment,--no, never!For to honour my parents was always my wish from my childhood,No one ever appear'd so prudent and wise as my parents,Who in the darker days of childhood carefully watch'd me.Much indeed it has been my lot to endure from my playmates,When with their knavish pranks they used to embitter my temper.Often I little suspected the tricks they were playing upon me:But if they happen'd to ridicule Father, whenever on SundaysOut of church he came with his slow deliberate footsteps,If they laugh'd at the strings of his cap, and his dressing-gown's flowers,Which he in stately wise wore, and to-day at length has discarded,Then in a fury I clench'd my fist, and, storming and raging,Fell upon them and hit and struck with terrible onslaught,Heedless where my blows fell. With bleeding noses they halloed,And could scarcely escape from the force of my blows and my kicking.Then, as in years I advanced, I had much to endure from my father,Who, in default of others to blame, would often abuse me,When at the Council's last sitting his anger perchance was excited,And I the penalty paid of the squabbles and strife of his colleagues.You yourself have oft pitied me; I endured it with patience,Always rememb'ring the much-to-be-honour'd kindness of parents,Whose only thought is to swell for our sakes their goods and possessions,And who deprive themselves of much, to save for their children.But, alas, not saving alone, for enjoyment hereafter,Constitutes happiness, no, not heaps of gold or of silver,Neither field upon field, however compact the estate be.For the father grows old, and his son at the same time grows older,Feeling no joy in To-day, and full of care for To-morrow.Now look down from this height, and see how beauteous before usLies the fair rich expanse, with vineyard and gardens at bottom;There are the stables and barns, and the rest of the property likewise;There I also descry the back of our house, in the gablesOf the roof may be seen the window of my small apartment.When I remember the time when I used to look out for the moon thereHalf through the night, or perchance at morning awaited the sunrise,When with but few hours of healthy sleep I was fully contented,Ah, how lonely do all things appear! My chamber, the court, andGarden, the beautiful field which spreads itself over the hillside;All appears but a desert to me: I still am unmarried!"Then his good mother answer'd his speech in a sensible manner"Son, your wish to be able to lead your bride to her chamber,Turning the night to the dearest and happiest half of your lifetime,Making your work by day more truly free and unfetter'd,Cannot be greater than that of your father and mother. We alwaysUrged you,--commanded, I even might say,--to choose some fair maiden.But I know full well, and my heart has told me alreadyIf the right hour arrives not, or if the right maiden appears notInstantly when they are sought for, man's choice is thrown in confusion,And he is driven by fear to seize what is counterfeit only.If I may tell you, my son, your choice already is taken,For your heart is smitten, and sensitive more than is usual.Answer me plainly, then, for my spirit already has told me:She whom now you have chosen is that poor emigrant maiden!"
　　"Yes, dear mother, you're right!" the son with vivacity answer'dYes, it is she! And unless this very day I conduct herHome as my bride, she will go on her way and escape me for ever,In the confusion of war, and in moving backwards and forwards.Mother, then before my eyes will in vain he unfoldedAll our rich estate, and each year henceforward be fruitful.Yes, the familiar house and the garden will be my aversion.Ah, and the love of my mother no comfort will give to my sorrow,For I feel that by Love each former bond must be loosen'd,When her own bonds she knits; 'tis not the maiden alone whoLeaves her father and mother behind, when she follows her husband.So it is with the youth; no more he knows mother and father.When he beholds the maiden, the only beloved one, approaching.Therefore let me go hence, to where desperation may lead me,For my father already has spoken in words of decision,And his house no longer is mine, if he shuts out the maidenWhom alone I would fain take home as my bride from henceforward."
　　Then the excellent sensible mother answer'd with quickness"Men are precisely like rocks when they stand opposed to each other!Proud and unyielding, the one will never draw near to the other.Neither will suffer his tongue to utter the first friendly accent.Therefore I tell you, my son, a hope still exists in my bosom,If she is worthy and good, he will give his consent to your marriage,Poor though she be, and although with disdain he refused you the poor thing.For in his hot-beaded fashion he utters many expressionsWhich he never intends; and so will accept the Refused One.But he requires kind words, and has a right to require them,For your father he is; his anger is all after dinner,When he more eagerly speaks, and questions the reasons of others,Meaning but little thereby; the wine then excites all the vigourOf his impetuous will, and prevents him from giving due weight toOther people's opinions; he hears and he feels his own only.But when evening arrives, the tone of the many discoursesWhich his friends and himself hold together, is very much alter'd.Milder becomes he, as soon as his liquor's effects have passed overAnd he feels the injustice his eagerness did unto others.Come, we will venture at once! Success the reward is of boldness,And we have need of the friends who now have assembled around him.--Most of all we shall want the help of our excellent pastor."Thus she eagerly spoke, and leaving the stone that she sat on,Also lifted her son from his seat. He willingly follow'd,And they descended in silence, revolving the weighty proposal.-----V. POLYHYMNIA.
　　THE COSMOPOLITE.
　　BUT the Three, as before, were still sitting and talking together,With the landlord, the worthy divine, and also the druggist,And the conversation still concern'd the same subject,Which in every form they had long been discussing together.Full of noble thoughts, the excellent pastor continued"I can't contradict you. I know 'tis the duty of mortalsEver to strive for improvement; and, as we may see, they strive alsoEver for that which is higher, at least what is new they seek after,But don't hurry too fast! For combined with these feelings, kind NatureAlso has given us pleasure in dwelling on that which is ancient,And in clinging to that to which we have long been accustom'd.Each situation is good that's accordant to nature and reason.Many things man desires, and yet he has need of but little;For but short are the days, and confined is the lot of a mortal.I can never blame the man who, active and restless,Hurries along, and explores each corner of earth and the oceanBoldly and carefully, while he rejoices at seeing the profitsWhich round him and his family gather themselves in abundance.But I also duly esteem the peaceable burgher,Who with silent steps his paternal inheritance paces,And watches over the earth, the seasons carefully noting.'Tis not every year that he finds his property alter'd;Newly-planted trees cannot stretch out their arms tow'rds the heavensAll in a moment, adorn'd with beautiful buds in abundance.No, a man has need of patience, he also has need ofPure unruffled tranquil thoughts and an intellect honest;For to the nourishing earth few seeds at a time he entrusteth,Few are the creatures he keeps at a time, with a view to their breeding,For what is Useful alone remains the first thought of his lifetime.Happy the man to whom Nature a mind thus attuned may have given!'Tis by him that we all are fed. And happy the townsmanOf the small town who unites the vocations of town and of country.He is exempt from the pressure by which the poor farmer is worried,Is not perplex'd by the citizens' cares and soaring ambition,Who, with limited means,--especially women and maidens,--Think of nothing but aping the ways of the great and the wealthy,You should therefore bless your son's disposition so peaceful,And the like-minded wife whom we soon may expect him to marry.
　　Thus he spoke. At that moment the mother and son stood before them.By the hand she led him and placed him in front of her husband"Father," she said, "how often have we, when talking together,Thought of that joyful day in the future, when Hermann, selectingAfter long waiting his bride at length would make us both happy!All kinds of projects we form'd. designing first one, then anotherGirl as his wife, as we talk'd in the manner that parents delight in.Now the day has arrived; and now has his bride been conductedHither and shown him by Heaven; his heart at length has decided.Were we not always saying that he should choose for himself, andWere you not lately wishing that he might feel for a maidenWarm and heart-felt emotions? And now has arrived the right moment!Yes, he has felt and has chosen, and like a man has decided.That fair maiden it is, the Stranger whom he encounter'd.Give her him; else he'll remain--he has sworn it--unmarried for ever."
　　And the son added himself:--"My father, O give her! My heart hasChosen purely and truly: she'll make you an excellent daughter."
　　But the father was silent. Then suddenly rose the good pastor,And address'd him as follows:--" One single moment's decisiveBoth of the life of a man, and of the whole of his Future.After lengthen'd reflection, each resolution made by himIs but the work of a moment; the prudent alone seize the right one.Nothing more dangerous is, in making a choice, than revolvingFirst this point and then that, and so confusing the feelings.Pure is Hermann's mind; from his youth I have known him; he never,Even in boyhood, was wont to extend his hand hither and thither.What he desired, was suitable to him; he held to it firmly.Be not astonish'd and scared, because there appears on a suddenWhat you so long have desired. 'Tis true the appearance at presentBears not the shape of the wish, as you in your mind had conceived it.For our wishes conceal the thing that we wish for; our gifts tooCome from above upon us, each clad in its own proper figure.Do not now mistake the maiden who has succeededFirst in touching the heart of your good wise son, whom you love so.Happy is he who is able to clasp the hand of his first love,And whose dearest wish is not doom'd to pine in his bosom!Yes, I can see by his face, already his fate is decided;True affection converts the youth to a man in a moment.He little changeable is; I fear me, if this you deny him,All the fairest years of his life will be changed into sorrow."
　　Then in prudent fashion the druggist, who long had been wantingHis opinion to give, rejoin'd in the following manner"This is Just a case when the middle course is the wisest!'Hasten slowly,' you know, was the motto of Caesar Augustus.I am always ready to be of use to my neighbours,And to turn to their profit what little wits I can boast of.Youth especially needs the guidance of those who are older.Let me then depart; I fain would prove her, that maiden,And will examine the people 'mongst whom she lives, and who know her.I am not soon deceived; I know how to rate their opinions."
　　Then forthwith replied the son, with eagerness speaking:--"Do so, neighbour, and go, make your inquiries. However,I should greatly prefer that our friend, the pastor, went with you;Two such excellent men are witnesses none can find fault with.O, my father! the maiden no vagabond is, I assure you,No mere adventurer, wand'ring about all over the country,And deceiving the inexperienced youths with her cunning;No! the harsh destiny link'd with this war, so destructive of all things,Which is destroying the world, and already has wholly uprootedMany a time-honour'd fabric, has driven the poor thing to exile.Are not brave men of noble birth now wand'ring in mis'ry?Princes are fleeing disguised, and monarchs in banishment living.Ah, and she also herself, the best of her sisters, is drivenOut of her native land; but her own misfortunes forgetting,Others she seeks to console, and, though helpless, is also most helpful.Great are the woes and distress which over the earth's face are brooding,But may happiness not be evoked from out of this sorrow?May not I, in the arms of my bride, the wife I have chosen,Even rejoice at the war, as you at the great conflagration?"
　　Then replied the father, and open'd his mouth with importance:--"Strangely indeed, my son, has your tongue been suddenly loosen'd,Which for years has stuck in your mouth, and moved there but rarelyI to-day must experience that which threatens each father:How the ardent will of a son a too-gentle motherWillingly favours, whilst each neighbour is ready to back him,Only provided it be at the cost of a father or husband!But what use would it be to resist so many together?For I see that defiance and tears will otherwise greet me.Go and prove her, and in God's name then hasten to bring herHome as my daughter; if not, he must think no more of the maiden."
　　Thus spake the father. The son exclaim'd with jubilant gesture"Ere the ev'ning arrives, you shall have the dearest of daughters,Such as the man desires whose bosom is govern'd by prudenceAnd I venture to think the good creature is fortunate also.Yes, she will ever be grateful that I her father and motherHave restored her in you, as sensible children would wish it.But I will loiter no longer; I'll straightway harness the horses,And conduct our friends on the traces of her whom I love so,Leave the men to themselves and their own intuitive wisdom,And be guided alone by their decision--I swear it,--And not see the maiden again, until she my own is."Then he left the house; meanwhile the others were eagerlySettling many a point, and the weighty matter debating.
　　Hermann sped to the stable forthwith, where the spirited stallionsTranquilly stood and with eagerness swallow'd the pure oats before them,And the well-dried hay, which was cut from the best of their meadows.Then in eager haste in their mouths the shining bits placed he,Quickly drew the harness through the well-plated buckles,And then fastend the long broad reins in proper position,Led the horses out in the yard, where already the carriage,Easily moved along by its pole, had been push'd by the servant.Then they restrain'd the impetuous strength of the fast-moving horses,Fastening both with neat-looking ropes to the bar of the carriage.Hermann seized his whip, took his seat, and drove to the gateway.When in the roomy carriage his friends had taken their places,Swiftly he drove away, and left the pavement behind them,Left behind the walls of the town and the clean-looking towers,Thus sped Hermann along, till he reach'd the familiar highway,Not delaying a moment, and galloping uphill and downhill.When however at length the village steeple descried he,And not far away lay the houses surrounded by gardens,He began to think it was time to hold in the horses.
　　By the time-honour'd gloom of noble lime-trees o'er shadow'd,Which for many a century past on the spot had been rooted,Stood there a green and spreading grass-plot in front of the village,Cover'd with turf, for the peasants and neighbouring townsmen a playground.Scooped out under the trees, to no great depth, stood a fountain.On descending the steps, some benches of stone might be seen there,Ranged all around the spring, which ceaselessly well'd forth its waters,Cleanly, enclosed by a low wall all round, and convenient to draw from.Hermann then determined beneath the shadow his horsesWith the carriage to stop. He did so, and spoke then as follows"Now, my friends, get down, and go by yourselves to discoverWhether the maiden is worthy to have the hand which I offer.I am convinced that she is; and you'll bring me no new or strange story:Had I to manage alone, I would straightway go off to the village,And in few words should my fate by the charming creature be settled.
　　Her you will easily recognize 'mongst all the rest of the people,For her appearance is altogether unlike that of others.But I will now describe the modest dress she is wearing:--First a bodice red her well-arch'd bosom upraises,Prettily tied, while black are the stays fitting closely around her.Then the seams of the ruff she has carefully plaited and folded,Which with modest grace, her chin so round is encircling.Free and joyously rises her head with its elegant oval,Strongly round bodkins of silver her back-hair is many times twistedHer blue well-plaited gown begins from under her bodice.And as she walks envelopes her well-turn'd ankles completely.But I have one thing to say, and this must expressly entreat you:Do not speak to the maiden, and let not your scheme be discover'd.But inquire of others, and hearken to all that they tell you,When you have learnt enough to satisfy father and mother,Then return to me straight, and we'll settle future proceedings.This is the plan which I have matured, while driving you hither."
　　Thus he spoke, and the friends forthwith went on to the village,Where, in gardens and barns and houses, the multitude crowded;All along the broad road the numberless carts were collected,Men were feeding the lowing cattle and feeding the horses.Women on every hedge the linen were carefully drying,Whilst the children in glee were splashing about in the streamlet.Forcing their way through the waggons, and past the men and the cattle,Walk'd the ambassador spies, looking well to the righthand and lefthand,Hoping somewhere to see the form of the well-described maiden;But wherever they look'd, no trace of the girl they discover'd.
　　Presently denser became the crowd. Round some of the waggons.Men in a passion were quarrelling, women also were screaming.Then of a sudden approach'd an aged man with firm footstepMarching straight up to the fighters; and forthwith was hush'd the contention,When he bade them be still, and with fatherly earnestness threaten'd."Are we not yet," he exclaim'd, "by misfortune so knitted together,As to have learnt at length the art of reciprocal patienceAnd toleration, though each cannot measure the actions of others?Prosperous men indeed may quarrel! Will sorrow not teach youHow no longer as formerly you should quarrel with brethren?Each should give way to each other, when treading the soil of the stranger,And, as you hope for mercy yourselves, you should share your possessions."
　　Thus the man address'd them, and all were silent. In peacefulHumour the reconciled men look'd after their cattle and waggons.When the pastor heard the man discourse in this fashion,And the foreign magistrate's peaceful nature discovered,He approach'd him in turn, and used this significant language"Truly, Father, when nations are living in days of good fortune,Drawing their food from the earth, which gladly opens its treasures,And its wish'd-for gifts each year and each month is renewing,Then all matters go smoothly; each thinks himself far the wisest,And the best, and so they exist by the side of each other,And the most sensible man no better than others is reckon'dFor the world moves on, as if by itself and in silence.But when distress unsettles our usual manner of living,Pulls down each time-honour'd fabric, and roots up the seed in our gardens,Drives the man and his wife far away from the home they delight in,Hurries them off in confusion through days and nights full of anguish,Ah! then look we around in search of the man who is wisest,And no longer in vain he utters his words full of wisdom.Tell me whether you be these fugitives' magistrate, Father,Over whose minds you appear to possess such an influence soothing?Aye, to-day I could deem you one of the leaders of old time,Who through wastes and through deserts conducted the wandering people;I could imagine 'twas Joshua I am addressing, or Moses."
　　Then with solemn looks the magistrate answer'd as follows"Truly the present times resemble the strangest of old times,Which are preserved in the pages of history, sacred or common.He in these days who has lived to-day and yesterday only,Many a year has lived, events so crowd on each other.When I reflect back a little, a grey old age I could fancyOn my head to be lying, and yet my strength is still active.Yes, we people in truth may liken ourselves to those othersUnto whom in a fiery bush appear'd, in a solemnMoment, the Lord our God; in fire and clouds we behold him."
　　When the pastor would fain continue to speak on this subject,And was anxious to learn the fate of the man and his party,Quickly into his ear his companion secretly whisper'd"Speak for a time with the magistrate, turning your talk on the maiden,Whilst I wander about, endeav'ring to find her. DirectlyI am successful, I'll join you again." Then nodded the pastor,And the spy went to seek her, in barns and through hedges and gardens.-----VI. KLIO.
　　THE AGE.
　　WHEN the pastor ask'd the foreign magistrate questions,What the people had suffer'd, how long from their homes they had wander'd,Then the man replied:--"By no means short are our sorrows,For we have drunk the bitters of many a long year together,All the more dreadful, because our fairest hopes have been blighted.Who can deny that his heart beat wildly and high in his bosomAnd that with purer pulses his breast more freely was throbbing,When the newborn sun first rose in the whole of its glory,When we heard of the right of man, to have all things in common,Heard of noble Equality, and of inspiriting Freedom!Each man then hoped to attain new life for himself, and the fettersWhich had encircled many a land appear'd to be broken,Fetters held by the hands of sloth and selfish indulgence.Did not all nations turn their gaze, in those days of emotion,Tow'rds the world's capital, which so many a long year had been so,And then more than ever deserved a name so distinguish'd?Were not the men, who first proclaim'd so noble a message,Names that are worthy to rank with the highest the sun ever shone on,Did not each give to mankind his courage and genius and language?
　　"And we also, as neighbours, at first were warmly excited.Presently after began the war, and the train of arm'd FrenchmenNearer approach'd; at first they appear'd to bring with them friendship,And they brought it in fact; for all their souls were exalted.And the gay trees of liberty ev'rywhere gladly they planted,Promising unto each his own, and the government long'd for.Greatly at this was youth, and greatly old age was delighted,And the joyous dance began round the newly-raised standards.In this manner the overpowering Frenchmen soon conquer'dFirst the minds of the men, with their fiery lively proceedings,Then the hearts of the women, with irresistible graces.Even the strain of the war, with its many demands, seem'd but trifling,For before our eyes the distance by hope was illumined,Luring our gaze far ahead into paths now first open'd before us."O how joyful the time, when with his bride the glad bridegroomWhirls in the dance, awaiting the day that will join them for everBut more glorious far was the time when the Highest of all thingsWhich man's mind can conceive, close by and attainable seemed.Then were the tongues of all loosen'd, and words of wisdom and feelingNot by greybeards alone, but by men and by striplings were utter'd.
　　"But the heavens soon clouded became. For the sake of the mast'ryStrove a contemptible crew, unfit to accomplish good actions.Then they murder'd each other, and took to oppressing their new-foundNeighbours and brothers, and sent on missions whole herds of self膕eekersAnd the superiors took to carousing and robbing by wholesale,And the inferiors down to the lowest caroused and robb'd also.Nobody thought of aught else than having enough for tomorrow.Terrible was the distress, and daily increased the oppression.None the cry understood, that they of the day were the masters.Then even temperate minds were attack'd by sorrow and fury;Each one reflected, and swore to avenge all the injuries suffer'd,And to atone for the hitter loss of hopes twice defrauded.Presently Fortune declared herself on the side of the Germans,And the French were compell'd to retreat by forced marches before them.Ah! the sad fate of the war we then for the first time experienced.For the victor is kind and humane, at least he appears so,And he spares the man he has vanquish'd, as if he his own were,When he employs him daily, and with his property helps him.But the fugitive knows no law; he wards off death only,And both quickly and recklessly all that he meets with, consumes he.Then his mind becomes heated apace; and soon desperationFills his heart, and impels him to all kinds of criminal actions.Nothing then holds he respected, he steals It. With furious longingOn the woman he rushes; his lust becomes awful to think of.Death all around him he sees, his last minutes in cruelty spends he,Wildly exulting in blood, and exulting in howls and in anguish.
　　"Then in the minds of our men arose a terrible yearningThat which was lost to avenge, and that which remain'd to defend still.All of them seized upon arms, lured on by the fugitives' hurry,By their pale faces, and by their shy, uncertain demeanour.There was heard the sound of alarm-bells unceasingly ringing,And the approach of danger restrain'd not their violent fury.Soon into weapons were turn'd the implements peaceful of tillage,And with dripping blood the scythe and the pitchfork were cover'd.Every foeman without distinction was ruthlessly slaughter'd,Fury was ev'rywhere raging, and artful, cowardly weakness.May I never again see men in such wretched confusion!Even the raging wild beast is a better object to gaze on.Ne'er let them speak of freedom, as if themselves they could govern!All the evil which Law has driven farback in the cornerSeems to escape, as soon as the fetters which bound it are loosen'd."
　　"Excellent man," replied the pastor, with emphasis speaking"If you're mistaken in man, 'tis not for me to reprove you.Evil enough have you suffer'd indeed from his cruel proceedings!Would you but look back, however, on days so laden with sorrow,You would yourself confess how much that is good you have witness'd,Much that is excellent, which remains conceald in the bossomTill by danger 'tis stirr'd, and till necessity makes manShow himself as an angel, a tutelar God unto others."
　　Then with a smile replied the worthy old magistrate, saying"Your reminder is wise, like that which they give to the suff'rerWho has had his dwelling burnt down, that under the ruins,Gold and silver are lying, though melted and cover'd with ashes.Little, indeed, it may be, and yet that little is precious,And the poor man digs it up, and rejoices at finding the treasure.Gladly, therefore, I turn my thoughts to those few worthy actionsWhich my memory still is able to dwell on with pleasure.Yes, I will not deny it, I saw late foemen unitingSo as to save the town from harm; I saw with devotionParents, children and friends impossible actions attempting,Saw how the youth of a sudden became a man, how the greybeardOnce more was young, how the child as a stripling appear'd in a moment.Aye, and the weaker sex, as people commonly call it,Show'd itself brave and daring, with presence of mind all-unwonted.Let me now, in the first place, describe a deed of rare meritBy a high-spirited girl accomplish'd, an excellent maiden,Who in the great farmhouse remain'd behind with the servants,When the whole of the men had departed, to fight with the strangers.Well, there fell on the court a troop of vagabond scoundrels,Plund'ring and forcing their way inside the rooms of the women.Soon they cast their eyes on the forms of the grown-up fair maidenAnd of the other dear girls, in age little more than mere children.Hurried away by raging desire, unfeelingly rush'd theyOn the trembling band, and on the high-spirited maiden.But she instantly seized the sword from the side of a ruffian,Hew'd him down to the ground; at her feet straight fell he, all bleeding,Then with doughty strokes the maidens she bravely deliver'd.Wounded four more of the robbers; with life, however, escaped they.Then she lock'd up the court, and, arm'd still, waited for succour.
　　When the pastor heard the praise of the maiden thus utter'dFeelings of hope for his friend forthwith arose in his bosom,And he prepared to ask what had been the fate of the damsel,Whether she, in the sorrowful flight, form'd one of the people?At this moment, however, the druggist nimbly approach'd them,Pull'd the sleeve of the pastor, and whisper'd to him as follows"I have at last pick'd out the maiden from many a hundredBy her description! Pray come and judge for yourself with your own eyes;Bring the magistrate with you, that we may learn the whole story."
　　So they turn'd themselves round; but the magistrate found himself summon'dBy his own followers, who had need of his presence and counsel.But the pastor forthwith the druggist accompanied, till theyCame to a gap in the hedge, when the latter pointed with slyness,"See you," exclaim'd he, "the maiden? The child's clothes she has been changing.And I recognise well the old calico--also the cushion--Cover of blue, which Hermann took in the bundle and gave her.Quickly and well, of a truth, she has used the presents left with her.These are evident proofs; and all the rest coincide too;For a bodice red her well-arch'd bosom upraises,Prettily tied, while black are the stays fitting close around her.Then the seams of the ruff she has carefully plaited and folded,Which, with modest grace, her chin so round is encircling;Free and joyously rises her head, with its elegant oval,Strongly round bodkins of silver her back-hair is many times twisted.When she is sitting, we plainly see her noble proportions,And the blue well-plaited gown which begins from close to her bosom,And in rich folds descending, her well-turn'd ankles envelops.'Tis she, beyond all doubt. So come, that we may examineWhether she be both a good and a frugal and virtuous maiden."Then the pastor rejoin'd, the sitting damsel inspecting"That she enchanted the youth, I confess is no matter of wonder,For she stands the test of the gaze of a man of experience.Happy the person to whom Mother Nature the right face has given!She recommends him at all times, he never appears as a stranger,Each one gladly approaches, and each one beside him would linger,If with his face is combined a pleasant and courteous demeanour.Yes, I assure you the youth has indeed discover'd a maidenWho the whole of the days of his life will enliven with gladness,And with her womanly strength assist him at all times and truly.Thus a perfect body preserves the soul also in pureness,And a vigorous youth of a happy old age gives assurance.
　　After reflecting a little, the druggist made answer as follows:--"Yet appearances oft are deceitful. I trust not the outside.Often, indeed, have I found the truth of the proverb which tells usEre you share a bushel of salt with a new-found acquaintance,Do not trust him too readily; time will make you more certainHow you and he will get on, and whether your friendship is lasting.Let us then, in the first place, inquire amongst the good peopleUnto whom the maiden is known, who can tell us about her."
　　"Well, of a truth I commend your prudence," the pastor continued"Not for ourselves are we wooing! To woo for others is serious."So they started to meet the worthy magistrate seeingHow in the course of his business he was ascending the main street.And the wise pastor straightway address'd him with foresight as follows"We, by-the-bye, have just seen a girl in the neighbouring gardenUnder an apple-tree sitting, and clothes for the children preparing,Made of worn calico, which for the purpose was doubtless presented.We were pleased by her face; she appears to be one of the right sort.Tell us, what know you about her? We ask from a laudable motive."
　　When the magistrate came to the garden and peep'd in, exclaimed he"Well do I know her, in truth; for when I told you the storyOf that noble deed which was done by the maiden I spoke of,How she seized on the sword, and defended herself, and the servants,She the heroine was! You can see how active her nature.But she's as good as she's strong; for her aged kinsman she tendedUntil the time of his death, for he died overwhelm'd by afflictionAt the distress of his town, and the danger his goods were exposed to.Also with mute resignation she bore the grievous afflictionOf her betroth'd's sad death, a noble young man who, incitedBy the first fire of noble thoughts to struggle for freedom,Went himself to Paris, and soon found a terrible death there.For, as at home, so there, he fought 'gainst intrigue and oppression."
　　Thus the magistrate spoke. The others departed and thanked him,And the pastor produced a gold piece (the silver his purse heldHe some hours before had with genuine kindness expendedWhen he saw the fugitives passing in sorrowful masses).
　　And to the magistrate handed it, saying:--" Divide it, I pray you,'Mongst those who need it the most. May God give it prosperous increase."
　　But the man refused to accept it, and said:--"I assure you,Many a dollar we've saved, and plenty of clothing and such things,And I trust we may reach our homes before they are finish'd."
　　Then continued the pastor, the gold in his hand once more placing"None should delay to give in days like the present, and no oneOught to refuse to receive what is offer'd with liberal kindness.No one can tell how long he will keep what in peace he possesses,No one, how long he is doom'd in foreign countries to wander,While he's deprived of the field and the garden by which he is nurtured."
　　"Bravo!" added in turn the druggist, with eagerness speaking"Had I but money to spare in my pocket, you surely should have it,Silver and gold alike; for your followers certainly need it.Yet I'll not leave you without a present, if only to show youMy good will, and I hope you will take the will for the action."Thus he spoke, and pull'd out by the strings the leather embroider'dPouch, in which he was wont his stock of tobacco to carry,Daintily open'd and shared its contents--some two or three pipes' full."Small in truth is the gift," he added. The magistrate answered:"Good tobacco is always a welcome present to trav'llers."Then the druggist began his canister to praise very highly.But the pastor drew him away, and the magistrate left them."Come, let us hasten!" exclaimed the sensible man, "for our young friendAnxiously waits; without further delay let him hear the good tidings."
　　So they hasten'd and came, and found that the youngster was leaning'Gainst his carriage under the lime-trees. The horses were pawingWildly the turf; he held them in check and stood there all pensive,Silently gazing in front, and saw not his friends coming near him,Till, as they came, they called him and gave him signals of triumph.Some way off the druggist already began to address him,But they approach'd the youth still nearer, and then the good pastorSeized his hand and spoke and took the word from his comrade"Friend, I wish you joy! Your eye so true and your true heartRightly have chosen! May you and the wife of your young days be happy!She is full worthy of you; so come and turn around the carriage,That we may reach without delay the end of the village,So as to woo her, and shortly escort the dear creature home with us."But the youth stood still, and without any token of pleasureHeard the words of the envoy, though sounding consoling and heav'nly,Deeply sigh'd and said:--"We came full speed in the carriageAnd shall probably go back home ashamed and but slowly;For, since I have been waiting care has fallen upon me,Doubt and suspicion and all that a heart full of love is exposed to.Do you suppose we have only to come, for the maiden to follow,Just because we are rich, and she poor and wandering in exile?Poverty, when undeserved, itself makes proud. The fair maidenSeems to be active and frugal; the world she may claim as her portion.Do you suppose that a woman of such great beauty and mannersCan have grown up without exciting love in man's bosom?Do you suppose that her heart until now has to love been fast closed?Do not drive thither in haste, for perchance to our shame and confusionWe shall have slowly to turn towards home the heads of our horses.Yes, some youth, I fear me, possesses her heart, and alreadyShe has doubtless promised her hand and her solemn troth plighted,And I shall stand all ashamed before her, When making my offer."
　　Then the pastor proceeded to cheer him with words of good comfort,But his companion broke in, in his usual talkative manner"As things used to be, this embarrassment would not have happened,When each matter was brought to a close in an orthodox fashion.Then for their son themselves the bride the parents selected,And a friend of the house was secretly call'd in the first place.He was then quietly sent as a suitor to visit the parentsOf the selected bride; and, dress'd in his gayest apparel,Went after dinner some Sunday to visit the excellent burgher,And began by exchanging polite remarks on all subjects,Cleverly turning and bending the talk in the proper direction.After long beating about the bush, he flatter'd the daughter,And spoke well of the man and the house that gave his commission.Sensible people soon saw his drift, and the sensible envoyWatch'd how the notion was taken, and then could explain himself farther.If they declined the proposal, why then the refusal cost nothing,But if all prosper'd, why then the suitor for ever thereafterPlay'd the first fiddle at every family feast and rejoicing.For the married couple remember'd the whole of their lifetimeWhose was the skilful hand by which the marriage knot tied was.All this now is chang'd, and with many an excellent customHas gone quite out of fashion. Each person woos for himself now.Everyone now must bear the weight of a maiden's refusalOn his own shoulders, and stand all ashamed before her, if needs be."
　　"Let that be as it may," then answered the young man who scarcelyHeard what was said, and his mind had made up already in silence"I will go myself, and out of the mouth of the maidenLearn my own fate, for towards her I cherish the most trustful feelingsThat any man ever cherish'd towards any woman whatever.That which she says will be good and sensible,--this I am sure of.If I am never to see her again, I must once more behold her,And the ingenuous gaze of her black eyes must meet for the last time.If to my heart I may clasp her never, her bosom and shouldersI would once more see, which my arm so longs to encircle:Once more the mouth I would see, from which one kiss and a Yes willMake me happy for ever, a No for ever undo me.But now leave me alone! Wait here no longer. Return youStraight to my father and mother, in order to tell them in personThat their son was right, and that the maiden is worthy.And so leave me alone! I myself shall return by the footpathOver the hill by the pear-tree and then descend through the vineyard,Which is the shortest way back. Oh may I soon with rejoicingTake the beloved one home! But perchance all alone I must slink backBy that path to our house and tread it no more with a light heart."Thus he spoke, and then placed the reins in the hands of the pastor,Who, in a knowing way both the foaming horses restraining,Nimbly mounted the carriage, and took the seat of the driver.
　　But you still delay'd, good cautious neighbour, and spoke thusFriend, I will gladly entrust to you soul, and spirit, and mind too,But my body and bones are not preserved in the best wayWhen the hand of a parson such worldly matters as reins grasps!"
　　But you smiled in return, you sensible pastor, replying"Pray jump in, nor fear with both body and spirit to trust me,For this hand to hold the reins has long been accustom'd,And these eyes are train'd to turn the corner with prudence.For we were wont to drive the carriage, when living at Strasburg,At the time when with the young baron I went there, for daily,Driven by me, through the echoing gateway thunder'd the carriageBy the dusty roads to distant meadows and lindens,Through the crowds of the people who spend their lifetime in walking."
　　Partially comforted, then his neighbour mounted the carriage,Sitting like one prepared to make a wise jump, if needs be,And the stallions, eager to reach their stables, coursed homewards,While beneath their powerful hoofs the dust rose in thick clouds.Long there stood the youth, and saw the dust rise before him,Saw the dust disperse; but still he stood there, unthinking.-----VII. ERATO.
　　DOROTHEA.
　　As the man on a journey, who, just at the moment of sunset,Fixes his gaze once more on the rapidly vanishing planet,Then on the side of the rocks and in the dark thicket still sees heHov'ring its image; wherever he turns his looks, on in front stillRuns it, and glitters and wavers before him in colours all splendid,So before Hermanns eyes did the beautiful form of the maidenSoftly move, and appear'd to follow the path through the cornfields.
　　But he roused himself up from his startling dream, and then slowlyTurn'd tow'rd the village his steps, and once more started,--for once moreSaw he the noble maiden's stately figure approaching.Fixedly gazed he; it was no phantom in truth; she herself 'twasIn her hands by the handle she carried two pitchers,--one larger,One of a smaller size, and nimbly walk'd to the fountain.And he joyfully went to meet her; the sight of her gave himCourage and strength, and so he address'd the surprised one as follows:--"Do I find you again, brave maiden, engaged in assistingOthers so soon, and in giving refreshment to those who may need it?Tell me why you have come all alone to the spring so far distant,Whilst the rest are content with the water that's found in the village?This one, indeed, special virtue possesses, and pleasant to drink is.Is't for the sake of that sick one you come, whom you saved with such courage?"
　　Then the good maiden the youth in friendly fashion saluted,Saying:--"Already my walk to the fountain is fully rewarded,Since I have found the kind person who gave us so many good presents;For the sight of a giver, like that of a gift, is refreshing.Come and see for yourself the persons who tasted your kindness,And receive the tranquil thanks of all you have aided.But that you may know the reason why I have come here,Water to draw at a spot where the spring is both pure and unceasing,I must inform you that thoughtless men have disturb'd all the waterFound in the village, by carelessly letting the horses and oxenWade about in the spring which give the inhabitants water.In the same manner, with all their washing and cleaning they've dirtiedAll the troughs of the village, and all the fountains have sullied.For each one of them only thinks how quickly and soon heMay supply his own wants, and cares not for those who come after."
　　Thus she spoke, and soon she arrived at the foot of the broad stepsWith her companion, and both of them sat themselves down on the low wallRound the spring. She bent herself over, to draw out the water,He the other pitcher took up, and bent himself over,And in the blue of the heavens they saw their figures reflected,Waving, and nodding, and in the mirror their greetings exchanging."Now let me drink," exclaim'd the youth in accents of gladness.And she gave him the pitcher. They then, like old friends, sat together,Leaning against the vessels, when she address'd him as follows"Say, why find I you here without your carriage and horses,Far from the place where first I saw you. Pray how came you hither?"
　　Hermann thoughtfully gazed on the ground, but presently liftedCalmly towards her his glances, and gazed on her face in kind fashion,Feeling quite calm and composed. And yet with love to address herFound he quite out of the question; for love from her eyes was not beaming,But an intellect clear, which bade him use sensible language.Soon he collected his thoughts, and quietly said to the maiden:--"Let me speak, my child, and let me answer your questions."'Tis for your sake alone I have come,--why seek to conceal it?For I happily live with two affectionate parents,Whom I faithfully help to look after our house and possessions,Being an only son, while numerous are our employments.I look after the field work; the house is carefully managedBy my father; my mother the hostelry cheers and enlivens.But you also have doubtless found out how greatly the servants,Sometimes by fraud, and sometimes by levity, worry their mistress,Constantly making her change them, and barter one fault for another.Long has my mother, therefore, been wanting a girl in the household,Who, not only with hand, but also with heart might assist her,In the place of the daughter she lost, alas, prematurely.Now when I saw you to-day near the carriage, so active and sprightly,Saw the strength of your arm and the perfect health of your members,When I heard your sensible words, I was struck with amazement,And I hasten'd back home, deservedly praising the strangerBoth to my parents and friends. And now I come to inform youWhat they desire, as I do. Forgive my stammering language!"
　　"Do not hesitate," said she, "to tell me the rest of your storyI have with gratitude felt that you have not sought to insult me.Speak on boldly, I pray; your words shall never alarm me;You would fain hire me now as maid to your father and mother,To look after the house, which now is in excellent order.And you think that in me you have found a qualified maiden,One that is able to work, and not of a quarrelsome nature.Your proposal was short, and short shall my answer be alsoYes! with you I will go, and the voice of my destiny follow.I have fulfill'd my duty, and brought the lying-in womanBack to her friends again, who all rejoice at her rescue.Most of them now are together, the rest will presently join them.All expect that they, in a few short days, will be ableHomewards to go; 'tis thus that exiles themselves love to flatter.But I cannot deceive myself with hopes so delusiveIn these sad days which promise still sadder days in the futureFor all the bonds of the world are loosen'd, and nought can rejoin them,Save that supreme necessity over our future impending.If in the house of so worthy a man I can earn my own living,Serving under the eye of his excellent wife, I will do so;For a wandering girl bears not the best reputation.Yes! with you I will go, as soon as I've taken the pitcherBack to my friends, and received the blessing of those worthy people.Come! you needs must see them, and from their hands shall receive me."
　　Joyfully heard the youth the willing maiden's decision,Doubting whether he now had not better tell her the whole truth;But it appear'd to him best to let her remain in her error,First to take her home, and then for her love to entreat her.Ah! but now he espied a golden ring on her finger,And so let her speak, while he attentively listen'd:--
　　"Let us now return," she continued, "the custom is alwaysTo admonish the maidens who tarry too long at the fountain,Yet how delightful it is by the fast-flowing water to chatter!"Then they both arose, and once more directed their glancesInto the fountain, and then a blissful longing came o'er them.
　　So from the ground by the handles she silently lifted the pitchers,Mounted the steps of the well, and Hermann follow'd the loved one.One of the pitchers he ask'd her to give him, thus sharing the burden."Leave it," she said, "the weight feels less when thus they are balanced;And the master I've soon to obey, should not be my servant.Gaze not so earnestly at me, as if my fate were still doubtfull!Women should learn betimes to serve, according to station,For by serving alone she attains at last to the mast'ry,To the due influence which she ought to possess in the household.Early the sister must learn to serve her brothers and parents,And her life is ever a ceaseless going and coming,Or a lifting and carrying, working and doing for others.Well for her, if she finds no manner of life too offensive,And if to her the hours of night and of day all the same are,So that her work never seems too mean, her needle too pointed,So that herself she forgets, and liveth only for others!For as a mother in truth she needs the whole of the virtues,When the suckling awakens the sick one, and nourishment calls forFrom the exhausted parent, heaping cares upon suff'ring.Twenty men together could not endure such a burden,And they ought not,--and yet they gratefully ought to behold it."
　　Thus she spoke, and with her silent companion advanced sheThrough the garden, until the floor of the granary reach'd they,Where the sick woman lay, whom she left by her daughters attended,Those dear rescued maidens, the types of innocent beauty.Both of them enter'd the room, and from the other direction,Holding a child in each hand, her friend, the magistrate, enter'd.These had lately been lost for some time by the sorrowing mother,But the old man had now found them out in the crowd of the people.And they sprang in with joy, to greet their dearly-loved mother,To rejoice in a brother, the playmate now seen for the first time!
　　Then on Dorothea they sprang, and greeted her warmly,Asking for bread and fruit, but asking for drink before all things.And they handed the water all round. The children first drank some,Then the sick woman drank, with her daughters, the magistrate also.All were refresh'd, and sounded the praise of the excellent water;Mineral was it, and very reviving, and wholesome for drinking.
　　Then with a serious look continued the maiden, and spoke thusFriends, to your mouths for the last time in truth I have lifted the pitcher,And for the last time, alas, have moisten'd your lips with pure water.But whenever in scorching heat your drink may refresh you,And in the shade you enjoy repose and a fountain unsullied,Then remember me, and all my friendly assistance,Which I from love, and not from relationship merely have render'd.All your kindness to me, as long as life lasts, I'll remember,I unwillingly leave you; but each one is now to each otherRather a burden than comfort. We all must shortly be scatter'dOver a foreign land, unless to return we are able.See, here stands the youth to whom for those gifts we're indebted,All those clothes for the child, and all those acceptable viands.Well, he has come, and is anxious that I to his house should go with him,There as a servant to act to his rich and excellent parents,And I have not refused him, for serving appears my vocation,And to be served by others at home would seem like a burden.So I'll go willingly with him; the youth appears to be prudent,Thus will his parents be properly cared for, as rich people should be.Therefore, now, farewell, my much-loved friend, and be joyfulIn your living infant, who looks so healthily at you.When you press him against your bosom, wrapp'd up in those colourdSwaddling-clothes, then remember the youth who so kindly bestow'd them,And who in future will feed and clothe me also, your loved friend.You too, excellent man," to the magistrate turning, she added"Warmly I thank for so often acting the part of a father."
　　Then she knelt herself down before the lying-in patient,Kiss'd the weeping woman, her whisper'd blessing receiving.Meanwhile the worthy magistrate spoke to Hermann as follows"You deserve, my friend to be counted amongst the good landlordsWho are anxious to manage their house through qualified people.For I have often observed how cautiously men are accustom'dSheep and cattle and horses to watch, when buying or bart'ringBut a man, who's so useful, provided he's good and efficient,And who does so much harm and mischief by treacherous dealings,Him will people admit to their houses by chance and haphazard,And too late find reason to rue an o'erhasty decision.This you appear to understand, for a girl you have chosenAs your servant, and that of your parents, who thoroughly good is.Treat her well, and as long as she finds the business suit her,You will not miss your sister, your parents will miss not their daughter."
　　Other persons now enter'd, the patient's nearest relations,Many articles bringing, and better lodgings announcing.All were inform'd of the maiden's decision, and warmly bless'd Hermann,Both with significant looks, and also with grateful expressions,And one secretly whispered into the ear of another"If the master should turn to a bridegroom, her home is provided."Hermann then presently took her hand, and address'd her as follows"Let us be going; the day is declining, and far off the village."Then the women, with lively expressions, embraced Dorothea;Hermann drew her away; they still continued to greet her.Next the children, with screams and terrible crying attack'd her,Pulling her clothes, their second mother refusing to part from.But first one of the women, and then another rebuked them"Children, hush! to the town she is going, intending to bring youPlenty of gingerbread back, which your brother already had order'd,From the confectioner, when the stork was passing there lately,And she'll soon return, with papers prettily gilded."
　　So at length the children released her; but scarcely could HermannTear her from their embraces and distant-signalling kerchiefs.-----VIII. MELPOMENE.
　　HERMANN AND DOROTHEA.
　　So tow'rd the sun, now fast sinking to rest, the two walk'd together,Whilst he veil'd himself deep in clouds which thunder portended.Out-of his veil now here, now there, with fiery glancesBeaming over the plain with rays foreboding and lurid."May this threatening weather," said Hermann, "not bring to us shortlyHail and violent rain, for well does the harvest now promise."And they both rejoiced in the corn so lofty and waving,Well nigh reaching the heads of the two tall figures that walk'd there.Then the maiden spoke to her friendly leader as follows"Generous youth, to whom I shall owe a kind destiny shortly,Shelter and home, when so many poor exiles must weather the tempest,In the first place tell me all about your good parents,Whom I intend to serve with all my soul from hence-forward;Knowing one's master, 'tis easier far to give satisfaction,By rememb'ring the things which he deems of the highest importance,And on which he has set his heart with the greatest decision.Tell me, then, how best I can win your father and mother."
　　Then the good and sensible youth made answer as follows"You are indeed quite right, my kind and excellent maiden,To begin by asking about the tastes of my parents!For I have hitherto striven in vain to satisfy Father,When I look'd after the inn, as well as my regular duty,Working early and late in the field, and tending the vineyard.Mother indeed was contented; she knew how to value my efforts;And she will certainly hold you to be an excellent maiden,If you take care of the house, as though the dwelling your own were.But my father's unlike her; he's fond of outward appearance.Gentle maiden, deem me not cold and void of all feeling,If I disclose my father's nature to you, who're a stranger.Yes, such words have never before escaped, I assure vonOut of my mouth, which is little accustom'd to babble and chatter;But you have managed to worm all my secrets from out of my bosom.Well, my worthy father the graces of life holds in honour,Wishes for outward signs of love, as well as of rev'rence,And would doubtless be satisfied with an inferior servantWho understood this fancy, and hate a better, who did not."
　　Cheerfully she replied, with gentle movement increasingThrough the darkening path the speed at which she was walking:I in truth shall hope to satisfy both of your parents,For your mother's character my own nature resembles,And to external graces have I from my youth been accustom'd.Our old neighbours, the French, in their earlier days laid much stress onCourteous demeanour; 'twas common alike to nobles and burghers,And to peasants, and each enjoin'd it on all his acquaintance.in the same way, on the side of the Germans, the children were train'd upEvery morning, with plenty of kissing of hands and of curtsies,To salute their parents, and always to act with politeness.All that I have learnt, and all I have practised since childhood,All that comes from my heart,--I will practise it all with the old man.But on what terms shall I--I scarcely dare ask such a question,--Be with yourself, the only son, and hereafter my master?"
　　Thus she spoke, and at that moment they came to the peartree.Down from the skies the moon at her full was shining in glory;Night had arrived, and the last pale gleam of the sunset had vanish'd.So before them were lying, in masses all heap'd up together,Lights as clear as the day, and shadows of night and of darkness.And the friendly question was heard by Hermann with pleasure,Under the shade of the noble tree at the spot which he loved soWhich that day had witness'd his tears at the fate of the exile.And whilst they sat themselves down, to take a little repose there,Thus the loving youth spoke, whilst he seized the hand of the maiden"Let your heart give the answer, and always obey what it tells you!"But he ventured to say no more, however propitiousWas the moment; he feard that a No would be her sole answer,Ah! and he felt the ring on her finger, that sorrowful token.So by the side of each other they quietly sat and in silence,But the maiden began to speak, and said, "How delightfulIs the light of the moon! The clearness of day it resembles.Yonder I see in the town the houses and courtyards quite plainly,In the gable a window; methinks all the panes I can reckon."
　　"That which you see," replied the youth, who spoke with an effort,"That is our house down to which I now am about to conduct you,And that window yonder belongs to my room in the attic,Which will probably soon be yours, as we're making great changes.All these fields are ours, and ripe for the harvest to-morrow;Here in the shade we are wont to rest, enjoying our meal-time.But let us now descend across the vineyard and garden,For observe how the threatening storm is hitherward rolling,Lightening first, and then eclipsing the beautiful full moon."So the pair arose, and wauder'd down by the corn-field,
　　Through the powerful corn, in the nightly clearness rejoicing;And they reach'd the vineyard, and through its dark shadows proceeded.So he guided her down the numerous tiers of the flat stonesWhich, in an unhewn state, served as steps to the walk through the foliage.Slowly she descended, and placed her hands on his shoulders;And, with a quivering light, the moon through the foliage o'erlook'd them,Till by storm-clouds envelop'd, she left the couple in darkness.Then the strong youth supported the maiden, who on him was leaning;She, however, not knowing the path, or observing the rough steps,Slipp'd as she walk'd, her foot gave way, and she well nigh was falling.Hastily held out his arm the youth with nimbleness thoughtful,And held up his beloved one; she gently sank on his shoulders,Breast was press'd against breast, and cheek against cheek, and so stood heFix'd like a marble statue, restrained by a firm resolution;He embraced her no closer, thoughall her weight he supported;So he felt his noble burden, the warmth of her bosom,And her balmy breath, against his warm lips exhaling,Bearing with manly feelings the woman's heroical greatness.
　　But she conceal'd the pain which she felt, and jestingly spoke thus"It betokens misfortune,--so scrupulous people inform us,--For the foot to give way on entering a house, near the threshold.I should have wish'd, in truth, for a sign of some happier omen!Let us tarry a little, for fear your parents should blame youFor their limping servant, and you should be thought a bad landlord."-----IX.  URANIA.
　　CONCLUSION.
　　O YE Muses, who gladly favour a love that is heartfelt,Who on his way the excellent youth have hitherto guided,Who have press'd the maid to his bosom before their betrothal,Help still further to perfect the bonds of a couple so loving,Drive away the clouds which over their happiness hover!But begin by saying what now in the house has been passing.
　　For the third time the mother impatiently enter'd the chamberWhere the men were sitting, which she had anxiously quitted,Speaking of the approaching storm, and the loss of the moon's light,Then of her son's long absence, and all the perils that night brings.Strongly she censured their friends for having so soon left the youngster,For not even addressing the maiden, or seeking to woo her.
　　"Make not the worst of the mischief," the father peevishly answer'd;"For you see we are waiting ourselves, expecting the issue."
　　But the neighbour sat still, and calmly address'd them as follows:--"In uneasy moments like these, I always feel gratefulTo my late father, who when I was young all seeds of impatienceIn my mind uprooted, and left no fragment remaining,And I learnt how to wait, as well as the best of the wise men."Tell us what legerdemain he employ'd," the pastor made answer."I will gladly inform you, and each one may gain by the lesson,"Answer'd the neighbour. "When I was a boy, I was standing one SundayIn a state of impatience, eagerly waiting the carriageWhich was to carry us out to the fountain under the lime-trees;But it came not; I ran like a weasel now hither, now thither,Up and down the stairs, and from the door to the window;Both my hands were prickling, I scratch'd away at the tables,Stamping and trotting about, and scarcely refrain'd I from crying.All this the calm man composedly saw; but finally when ICarried my folly too far, by the arm he quietly took me,Led me up to the window, and used this significant language'See you up yonder the joiner's workshop, now closed for the Sunday?'Twill be re-open'd to-morrow, and plane and saw will be working.Thus will the busy hours be pass'd from morning till evening.But remember this: the rimming will soon be arriving,When the master, together with all his men, will be busyIn preparing and finishing quickly and deftly your coffin,And they will carefully bring over here that house made of boards, whichWill at length receive the patient as well as impatient,And which is destined to carry a roof that's unpleasantly heavy.All that he mention'd I forthwith saw taking place in my mind's eye,Saw the boards join'd together, and saw the black cover made ready,Patiently then I sat, and meekly awaited the carriage.And I always think of the coffin whenever I see menRunning about in a state of doubtful and wild expectation."
　　Smilingly answered the pastor:--"Death's stirring image is neitherUnto the wise a cause of alarm,--or an end to the pious.Back into life it urges the former, and teaches him action,And, for the weal of the latter, it strengthens his hope in affliction.Death is a giver of life unto both. Your father did wronglyWhen to the sensitive boy he pointed out death in its own form.Unto the youth should be shown the worth of a noble and ripen'dAge, and unto the old man, youth, that both may rejoice inThe eternal circle, and life may in life be made perfect!"
　　Here the door was open'd. The handsome couple appear'd there,And the friends were amazed, the loving parents astonish'dAt the form of the bride, the form of the bridegroom resembling.Yes! the door appear'd too small to admit the tall figuresWhich now cross'd the threshold, in company walking together.To his parents Hermann presented her, hastily saying:--"Here is a maiden just of the sort you are wishing to have here,Welcome her kindly, dear father! she fully deserves it, and you too,Mother dear, ask her questions as to her housekeeping knowledge,That you may see how well she deserves to form one of our party."Then he hastily took on one side the excellent pastor,Saying:--" Kind sir, I entreat you to help me out of this troubleQuickly, and loosen the knot, whose unravelling I am so dreading;For I have not ventured to woo as my bride the fair maiden,But she believes she's to be a maid in the house, and I fear meShe will in anger depart, as soon as we talk about marriage.But it must be decided at once! no longer in errorShall she remain, and I no longer this doubt can put up with.Hasten and once more exhibit that wisdom we all hold in honour."So the pastor forthwith turn'd round to the rest of the party,But the maiden's soul was, unhappily, troubled alreadyBy the talk of the father, who just had address'd her as follows,Speaking good humour'dly, and in accents pleasant and lively"Yes, I'm well satisfied, child! I joyfully see that my son hasJust as good taste as his father, who in his younger days show'd it,Always leading the fairest one out in the dance, and then lastlyTaking the fairest one home as his wife--'twas your dear little mother!For by the bride whom a man selects, we may easily gatherWhat kind of spirit his is, and whether he knows his own value.But you will surely need but a short time to form your decision,For I verily think he will find it full easy to follow."Hermann but partially heard the words; the whole of his membersInwardly quivered, and all the circle were suddenly silent.
　　But the excellent maiden, by words of such irony wounded,(As she esteem'd them to be) and deeply distress'd in her spirit,Stood, while a passing flush from her cheeks as far as her neck wasSpreading, but she restrain'd herself, and collected her thoughts soon;Then to the old man she said, not fully concealing her sorrow"Truly I was not prepared by your son for such a reception,When he described his father's nature,--that excellent burgher,And I know I am standing before you, a person of culture,Who behaves himself wisely to all, in a suitable manner.But it would seem that you feel not pity enough for the poor thingWho has just cross'd your threshold, prepared to enter your serviceElse you would not seek to point out, with ridicule bitter,How far removed my lot from your son's and that of yourself is.True, with a little bundle, and poor, I have enter'd your dwelling,Which it is the owner's delight to furnish with all things.But I know myself well, and feel the whole situation.Is it generous thus to greet me with language so jeering,Which was well nigh expelled me the house, when just on the threshold?"
　　Hermann uneasily moved about, and signed to the pastorTo interpose without delay, and clear up the error.Quickly the wise man advanced to the spot, and witness'd the maiden'sSilent vexation and tearful eyes and scarce-restrain'd sorrow.Then his spirit advised him to solve not at once the confusion,But, on the contrary, prove the excited mind of the maiden.So, in words framed to try her, the pastor address'd her as follows:--"Surely, my foreign maiden, you did not fully consider,When you made up your mind to serve a stranger so quickly,What it really is to enter the house of a master;For a shake of the hand decides your fate for a twelvemonth,And a single word Yes to much endurance will bind you.But the worst part of the service is not the wearisome habits,Nor the bitter toil of the work, which seems never-ending;For the active freeman works hard as well as the servant.But to suffer the whims of the master, who blames you unjustly,Or who calls for this and for that, not knowing his own mind,And the mistress's violence, always so easily kindled,With the children's rough and supercilious bad manners,--This is indeed hard to bear, whilst still fulfilling your dutiesPromptly and actively, never becoming morose or ill-natured;Yet for such work you appear little fit, for already the father'sJokes have offended you deeply; yet nothing more commonly happensThan to tease a maiden about her liking a youngster."Thus he spoke, and the maiden felt the weight of his language,And no more restrain'd herself; mightily all her emotionsShow'd themselves, her bosom heaved, and a deep sigh escaped her,And whilst shedding burning tears, she answer'd as follows:--"Ne'er does the clever man, who seeks to advise us in sorrow,Think how little his chilling words our hearts can deliverFrom the pangs which an unseen destiny fastens upon us.You are happy and merry. How then should a jest ever wound you?But the slightest touch gives torture to those who are suff'ring.Even dissimulation would nothing avail me at present.Let me at once disclose what later would deepen my sorrow,And consign me perchance to agony mute and consuming.Let me depart forthwith! No more in this house dare I linger;I must hence and away, and look once more for my poor friendsWhom I left in distress, when seeking to better my fortunes.This is my firm resolve; and now I may properly tell youThat which had else been buried for many a year in my bosom.Yes, the father's jest has wounded me deeply, I own it,Not that I'm proud and touchy, as ill becometh a servant,But because in truth in my heart a feeling has risenFor the youth, who to-day has fill'd the part of my Saviour.For when first in the road he left me, his image remain'd stillFirmly fix'd in my mind; and I thought of the fortunate maidenWhom, as his betroth'd one, he cherish'd perchance in his bosom.And when I found him again at the well, the sight of him charm'd meJust as if I had-seen an angel descending from heaven.And I follow'd him willingly, when as a servant he sought me,But by my heart in truth I was flatter'd (I need must confess it),As I hitherward came, that I might possibly win him,If I became in the house an indispensable pillar.But, alas, I now see the dangers I well nigh fell into,When I bethought me of living so near a silently-loved one.Now for the first time I feel how far removed a poor maidenIs from a richer youth, however clever she may be.I have told you all this, that you my heart may mistake not,Which an event that in thought I foreshadow has wounded already.For I must have expected, my secret wishes concealing,That, ere much time had elapsed, I should see him bringing his bride home.And how then could I have endured my hidden affliction!Happily I am warn'd in time, and out of my bosomHas my secret escaped, whilst curable still is the evil.But no more of the subject! I now must tarry no longerIn this house, where I now am standing in pain and confusion,All my foolish hopes and my feelings freely confessing.Not the night which, with sinking clouds, is spreading around us,Not the rolling thunder (I hear it already) shall stop me,Not the falling rain, which outside is descending in torrents,Not the blustering storm. All this I had to encounterIn that sorrowful flight, while the enemy follow'd behind Us.And once more I go on my way, as I long have been wont to,Seized by the whirlpool of time, and parted from all that I care for.So farewell! I'll tarry no longer. My fate is accomplish'd!"
　　Thus she spoke, and towards the door she hastily turn'd her,Holding under her arm the bundle she brought when arriving.But the mother seized by both of her arms the fair maiden,Clasping her round the body, and cried with surprise and amazement"Say, what signifies this? These fruitless tears, what denote they?No, I'll not leave you alone! You're surely my dear son's betroth'd one!"But the father stood still, and show'd a great deal of reluctance,Stared at the weeping girl, and peevishly spoke then as follows"This, then, is all the indulgence my friends are willing to give me,That at the close of the day the most unpleasant thing happens!For there is nothing I hate so much as the tears of a woman,And their passionate cries, set up with such heat and excitement,Which a little plain sense would show to be utterly needless.Truly, I find the sight of these whimsical doings a nuisance.Matters must shift for themselves; as for me, I think it is bed-time."So he quickly turn'd round, and hasten'd to go to the chamberWhere the marriage-bed stood, in which he slept for the most part.But his son held him back, and spoke in words of entreaty"Father, don't go in a hurry, and be not amniote with the maiden!I alone have to bear the blame of all this confusion,Which our friend has increased by his unexpected dissembling.Speak then, honour'd Sir! for to you the affair I confided;Heap not up pain and annoyance, but rather complete the whole matter;For I surely in future should not respect you so highly,If you play practical jokes, instead of displaying true wisdom."
　　Thereupon the worthy pastor smilingly answer'd"What kind of wisdom could have extracted the charming confessionOf this good maiden, and so have reveal'd all her character to us?Is not your care converted at once to pleasure and rapture?Speak out, then, for yourself! Why need explanations from othersHermann then stepped forward, and gently address'd her as follows"Do not repent of your tears, nor yet of your passing affliction;For they perfect my happiness; yours too, I fain would consider.I came not to the fountain, to hire so noble a maidenAs a servant, I came to seek to win you affections.But, alas! my timid gaze had not strength to discoverYour heart's leanings; it saw in your eye but a friendly expression,When you greeted it out of the tranquil fountain's bright mirror.Merely to bring you home, made half of my happiness certainBut you now make it complete! May every blessing be yours, then!"Then the maiden look'd on the youth with heartfelt emotion,And avoided not kiss or embrace, the summit of rapture,When they also are to the loving the long-wish'd-for pledgesOf approaching bliss in a life which now seems to them endless.Then the pastor told the others the whole of the story;But the maiden came and gracefully bent o'er the father,Kissing the while his hand, which he to draw back attempted.And she said:--" I am sure that you will forgive the surprised one,First for her tears of sorrow, and then for her tears of true rapture.O forgive the emotions by which they both have been prompted,And let me fully enjoy the bliss that has now been vouchsafed me!Let the first vexation, which my confusion gave rise to,Also be the last! The loving service which latelyWas by the servant promised, shall now by the daughter be render'd."
　　And the father, his tears concealing, straightway embraced her;Lovingly came the mother in turn, and heartily kiss'd her,Warmly shaking her hand; and silently wept they together.Then in a hasty manner, the good and sensible pastorSeized the hand of the father, his wedding-ring off from his fingerDrawing (not easily though; so plump was the member that held it)Then he took the mother's ring, and betroth'd the two children,Saying:--"Once more may it be these golden hoops' destinationFirmly to fasten a bond altogether resembling the old one!For this youth is deeply imbued with love for the maiden,And the maiden confesses that she for the youth has a liking.Therefore, I now betroth you, and wish you all blessings hereafter,With the parents' consent, and with our friend here as a witness."
　　And the neighbour bent forward, and added his own benediction;But when the clergyman placed the gold ring on the hand of the maiden,He with astonishment saw the one which already was on it,And which Hermann before at the fountain had anxiously noticed.Whereupon he spoke in words at once friendly and jesting"What! You are twice engaging yourself? I hope that the first oneMay not appear at the altar, unkindly forbidding the banns there!"
　　But she said in reply:--"O let me devote but one momentTo this mournful remembrance! For well did the good youth deserve it,Who, when departing, presented the ring, but never return'd home.All was by him foreseen, when freedom's love of a sudden,And a desire to play his part in the new-found Existence,Drove him to go to Paris, where prison and death were his portion.'Farewell,' said he, 'I go; for all things on earth are in motionAt this moment, and all things appear in a state of disunion.Fundamental laws in the steadiest countries are loosen'd,And possessions are parted from those who used to possess them,Friends are parted from friends, and love is parted from love too.I now leave you here, and whether I ever shall see youHere again,--who can tell? Perchance these words will our last be.Man is a stranger here upon earth, the proverb informs us;Every person has now become more a stranger than ever.Ours the soil is no longer; our treasures are fast flying from us;All the sacred old vessels of gold and silver are melted,All is moving, as though the old-fashion'd world would roll backwardsInto chaos and night, in order anew to be fashion'd.You of my heart have possession, and if we shall ever here-afterMeet again over the wreck of the world, it will be as new creatures,All remodell'd and free and independent of fortune;For what fetters can bind down those who survive such a period!But if we are destined not to escape from these dangers,If we are never again to embrace each other with rapturesO then fondly keep in your thoughts my hovering image,That you may be prepared with like courage for good and ill fortune!If a new home or a new alliance should chance to allure you,Then enjoy with thanks whatever your destiny offers,Purely loving the loving, and grateful to him who thus loves you.But remember always to tread with a circumspect footstep,For the fresh pangs of a second loss will behind you be lurking.Deem each day as sacred; but value not life any higherThan any other possession, for all possessions are fleeting.'Thus he spoke; and the noble youth and I parted for ever:Meanwhile I ev'rything lost, and a thousand times thought of his warning.Once more I think of his words, now that love is sweetly preparingHappiness for me anew, and the brightest of hopes is unfolding.Pardon me, dearest friend, for trembling e'en at the momentWhen I am clasping your arm! For thus, on first landing, the sailorFancies that even the solid ground is shaking beneath him."
　　Thus she spoke, and she placed the rings by the side of each other.But the bridegroom answer'd, with noble and manly emotion"All the firmer, amidst the universal disruption,Be, Dorothea, our union! We'll show ourselves bold and enduring,Firmly hold our own, and firmly retain our possessions.For the man who in wav'ring times is inclined to be wav'ringOnly increases the evil, and spreads it wider and wider;But the man of firm decision the universe fashions.'Tis not becoming the Germans to further this fearful commotion,And in addition to waver uncertainly hither and thither.'This is our own!' we ought to say, and so to maintain it!For the world will ever applaud those resolute nationsWho for God and the Law, their wives, and parents, and childrenStruggle, and fall when contending against the foeman together.You are mine; and now what is mine, is mine more than ever.Not with anxiety will I preserve it, or timidly use it,But with courage and strength. And if the enemy threatenNow or hereafter, I'll hold myself ready, and reach down my weapons.If I know that the house and my parents by you are protected,I shall expose my breast to the enemy, void of all terror;And if all others thought thus, then might against might should be measured,And in the early prospect of peace we should all be rejoicing."
　　1796?.-----WEST-EASTERN DIVAN.-----Who the song would understand,Needs must seek the song's own land.Who the minstrel understand,Needs must seek the minstrel's land.-----
　　THE Poems comprised in this collection are written in thePersian style, and are greatly admired by Oriental scholars, forthe truthfulness with which the Eastern spirit of poetry isreproduced by the Western minstrel. They were chiefly composedbetween the years 1814 and 1819, and first given to the world inthe latter year. Of the twelve books into which they are divided,that of Suleika will probably be considered the best, from themany graceful love-songs which it contains. The following isHanoi's account of the Divan, and may well serve as a substitutefor anything I could say respecting it:--
　　It contains opinions and sentiments on the East, expressed in aseries of rich cantos and stanzas full of sweetness and spirit,and all this as enchanting as a harem emitting the most deliciousand rare perfumes, and blooming with exquisitely-lovely nymphswith eyebrows painted black, eyes piercing as those of theantelope, arms white as alabaster, and of the most graceful andperfectly-formed shapes, while the heart of the reader beats andgrows faint, as did that of the happy Gaspard Debaran, the clown,who, when on the highest step of his ladder, was enabled to peepinto the Seraglio of Constantinople--that recess concealed fromthe inspection of man. Sometimes also the reader may imaginehimself indolently stretched on a carpet of Persian softness,luxuriously smoking the yellow tobacco of Turkistan through along tube of jessamine and amber, while a black slave fans himwith a fan of peacock's feathers, and a little boy presents himwith a cup of genuine Mocha. Goethe has put these enchanting andvoluptuous customs into poetry, and his verses are so perfect, soharmonious, so tasteful, so soft, that it seems really surprisingthat he should ever have been able to have brought the Germanlanguage to this state of suppleness. The charm of the book isinexplicable; it is a votive nosegay sent from the West to theEast, composed of the most precious and curious plants: redroses, hortensias like the breast of a spotless maiden, purpledigitalis like the long finger of a man, fantastically formedranunculi, and in the midst of all, silent and tastefullyconcealed, a tuft of German violets. This nosegay signifies thatthe West is tired of thin and icy-cold spirituality, and seekswarmth in the strong and healthy bosom of the East."
　　Translations are here given of upwards of sixty of the bestPoems embraced in the Divan, the number in the original exceedingtwo hundred.-----I.  MORGAGNI NAME.

　　Now, Song, with thine own fire be sung,--For thou art older, thou more young!
　　1817.*-----TO HAFIS.
　　HAFIS, straight to equal thee,
　　One would strive in vain;Though a ship with majesty
　　Cleaves the foaming main,Feels its sails swell haughtily
　　As it onward hiesCrush'd by ocean's stern decree,
　　Wrecked it straightway lies.Tow'rd thee, songs, light, graceful, free,
　　Mount with cooling gush;Then their glow consumeth me,
　　As like fire they rush.Yet a thought with ecstasy
　　Hath my courage moved;In the land of melody
　　I have lived and loved.

　　WOULD we let our envy burst,
　　Feed its hunger fully first!To keep our proper place,
　　We'll show our bristles more;With hawks men all things chase,
　　Except the savage boar.-----BY those who themselves more bravely have foughtA hero's praise will be joyfully told.The worth of man can only be taughtBy those who have suffer'd both heat and cold.-----"WHEREFORE is truth so far from our eyes,Buried as though in a distant land?"None at the proper moment are wise!
　　Could they properly understand,
　　Truth would appear in her own sweet guise,Beauteous, gentle, and close at hand.-----WHY these inquiries make,

　　BOOK OF TIMUR.
　　THE WINTER AND TIMUR.
　　So the winter now closed round themWith resistless fury. ScatteringOver all his breath so icy,He inflamed each wind that blitheTo assail them angrily.Over them he gave dominionTo his frost-unsharpened tempests;Down to Timur's council went he,And with threat'ning voice address'd him:--"Softly, slowly, wretched being!Live, the tyrant of injustice;But shall hearts be scorch'd much longerBy thy flames,--consume before them?If amongst the evil spiritsThou art one,--good! I'm another.Thou a greybeard art--so I am;Land and men we make to stiffen.Thou art Mars! And I Saturnus,--Both are evil-working planets,When united, horror-fraught.Thou dost kill the soul, thou freezesE'en the atmosphere; still colderIs my breath than thine was ever.Thy wild armies vex the faithfulWith a thousand varying torments;Well! God grant that I discoverEven worse, before I perish!And by God, I'll give thee none.Let God hear what now I tell thee!Yes, by God! from Death's cold clutchesNought, O greybeard, shall protect thee,Not the hearth's broad coalfire's ardour,Not December's brightest flame."
　　1814.-----TO SULEIKA.
　　FITTING perfumes to prepare,
　　And to raise thy rapture high,Must a thousand rosebuds fair
　　First in fiery torments die.
　　One small flask's contents to glean,
　　Whose sweet fragrance aye may live,Slender as thy finger e'en,
　　Must a world its treasures give;
　　Yes, a world where life is moving,
　　Which, with impulse full and strong,Could forbode the Bulbul's loving,
　　Sweet, and spirit-stirring song.
　　Since they thus have swell'd our joy,
　　Should such torments grieve us, then?Doth not Timur's rule destroy
　　Myriad souls of living men?
　　1815.*-----VIII. SULEIKA NAME.
　　BOOK OF SULEIKA.
　　ONCE, methought, in the night hours cold,
　　That I saw the moon in my sleep;But as soon as I waken'd, behold
　　Unawares rose the sun from the deep.
　　THAT Suleika's love was so strong
　　For Joseph, need cause no surprise;
　　He was young, youth pleaseth the eyes,--
　　He was fair, they say, beyond measure
　　Fair was she, and so great was their pleasure.But that thou, who awaitedst me long,Youthful glances of fire dost throw me,Soon wilt bless me, thy love now dost show me,This shall my joyous numbers proclaim,Thee I for ever Suleika shall name.
　　1815.-----HATEM.
　　NOT occasion makes the thief;
　　She's the greatest of the whole;For Love's relics, to my grief,
　　From my aching heart she stole.
　　She hath given it to thee,--
　　All the joy my life had known,So that, in my poverty,
　　Life I seek from thee alone.
　　Yet compassion greets me straight
　　In the lustre of thine eye,And I bless my newborn fate,
　　As within thine arms I lie.
　　1815.-----SULEIKA.
　　THE sun appears! A glorious sight!
　　The crescent-moon clings round him now.What could this wondrous pair unite?
　　How to explain this riddle? How?
　　HATEM.
　　May this our joy's foreboder prove!
　　In it I view myself and thee;Thou calmest me thy sun, my love,--
　　Come, my sweet moon, cling thou round me!
　　1815.-----LOVE for love, and moments sweet,
　　Lips returning kiss for kiss,Word for word, and eyes that meet;
　　Breath for breath, and bliss for bliss.Thus at eve, and thus the morrow!
　　Yet thou feeblest, at my lay,Ever some half-hidden sorrow;Could I Joseph's graces borrow,
　　All thy beauty I'd repay!
　　1815.-----HATEM.
　　O, SAY, 'neath what celestial sign
　　The day doth lie,When ne'er again this heart of mine
　　Away will fly?And e'en though fled (what thought divine!)
　　Would near me lie?--On the soft couch, on whose sweet shrine
　　My heart near hers will lie!
　　1816.-----HATEM.
　　HOLD me, locks, securely caught
　　In the circle of her face!Dear brown serpents, I have nought
　　To repay this act of grace,
　　Save a heart whose love ne'er dies,
　　Throbbing with aye-youthful glow;For a raging ETA lies
　　'Neath its veil of mist and snow.
　　Yonder mountain's stately brow
　　Thou, like morning beams, dost shame;Once again feels Hatem now
　　Spring's soft breath and summer's flame.
　　One more bumper! Fill the glass;
　　This last cup I pledge to thee!--By mine ashes if she pass,
　　"He consumed," she'll say, "for me."
　　1815.-----THE LOVING ONE SPEAKS.
　　AND wherefore sends notThe horseman-captainHis heralds hither
　　Each day, unfailing?Yet hath he horses,He writes well.
　　He waiteth Tali,And Neski knows heTo write with beautyOn silken tablets.I'd deem him present,Had I his words.
　　The sick One will not,Will not recoverFrom her sweet sorrow;She, when she hearethThat her true loverGrows well, falls sick.
　　1819.*-----THE LOVING ONE AGAIN.
　　WRITES he in Neski,Faithfully speaks he;Writes he in Tali,Joy to give, seeks he:Writes he in either,Good!--for he loves!
　　1819.*-----THESE tufted branches fair
　　Observe, my loved one, well!And see the fruits they bear
　　In green and prickly shell!
　　They've hung roll'd up, till now,
　　Unconsciously and still;A loosely-waving bough
　　Doth rock them at its will.
　　Yet, ripening from within.
　　The kernel brown swells fast;It seeks the air to win,
　　It seeks the sun at last.
　　With joy it bursts its thrall,
　　The shell must needs give way.'Tis thus my numbers fall
　　Before thy feet, each day.
　　1815.-----SULEIKA.
　　WHAT is by this stir reveal'd?
　　Doth the East glad tidings bring?For my heart's deep wounds are heal'd
　　By his mild and cooling wing.
　　He the dust with sports doth meet,
　　And in gentle cloudlets chase;To the vineleaf's safe retreat
　　Drives the insects' happy race,
　　Cools these burning cheeks of mine,
　　Checks the sun's fierce glow Adam,Kisses, as he flies, the vine,
　　Flaunting over hill and plain.
　　And his whispers soft convey
　　Thousand greetings from my friend;Ere these hills own night's dark sway,
　　Kisses greet me, without end.
　　Thus canst thou still onward go,
　　Serving friend and mourner too!There, where lofty ramparts glow,
　　Soon the loved one shall I view.
　　Ah, what makes the heart's truth known,--
　　Love's sweet breath,--a newborn life,--Learn I from his mouth alone,
　　In his breath alone is rife!
　　1815.-----THE SUBLIME TYPE.
　　THE sun, whom Grecians Helms call,
　　His heavenly path with pride doth tread,And, to subdue the world's wide all,
　　Looks round, beneath him, high o'er head.
　　He sees the fairest goddess pine,
　　Heaven's child, the daughter of the clouds,--For her alone he seems to shine;
　　In trembling grief his form he shrouds,
　　Careless for all the realms of bliss,--
　　Her streaming tears more swiftly flow:For every pearl he gives a kiss,
　　And changeth into joy her woe.
　　She gazeth upward fixedly,
　　And deeply feels his glance of might,While, stamped with his own effigy,
　　Each pearl would range itself aright.
　　Thus wreath'd with bows, with hues thus grac'd,
　　With gladness beams her face so fair,While he, to meet her, maketh haste,
　　And yet, alas! can reach her ne'er.
　　So, by the harsh decree of Fate,
　　Thou modest from me, dearest one;And were I Helms e'en, the Great,
　　What would avail his chariot-throne?
　　1815.-----SULEIKA.
　　ZEPHYR, for thy humid wing,
　　Oh, how much I envy thee!Thou to him canst tidings bring
　　How our parting saddens me!
　　In my breast, a yearning still
　　As thy pinions wave, appears;Flow'rs and eyes, and wood, and hill
　　At thy breath are steeped in tears.
　　Yet thy mild wing gives relief,
　　Soothes the aching eyelid's pain;Ah, I else had died for grief,
　　Him ne'er hoped to see again.
　　To my love, then, quick repair,
　　Whisper softly to his heart;Yet, to give him pain, beware,
　　Nor my bosom's pangs impart.
　　Tell him, but in accents coy,
　　That his love must be my life;Both, with feelings fraught with joy,
　　In his presence will be rife.
　　1815.-----THE REUNION.
　　CAN it be! of stars the star,
　　Do I press thee to my heart?In the night of distance far,
　　What deep gulf, what bitter smart!Yes, 'tis thou, indeed, at last,
　　Of my joys the partner dear!Mindful, though, of sorrows past,
　　I the present needs must fear.
　　When the still-unfashion'd earth
　　Lay on God's eternal breast,He ordain'd its hour of birth,
　　With creative joy possess'd.Then a heavy sigh arose,
　　When He spake the sentence:--"Be!"And the All, with mighty throes,
　　Burst into reality.
　　And when thus was born the light,
　　Darkness near it fear'd to stay,And the elements with might
　　Fled on every side away;Each on some far-distant trace,
　　Each with visions wild employ,Numb, in boundless realm of space,
　　Harmony and feeling-void.
　　Dumb was all, all still and dead,
　　For the first time, God alone!Then He form'd the morning-red,
　　Which soon made its kindness known:It unravelled from the waste,
　　Bright and glowing harmony,And once more with love was grac'd
　　What contended formerly.
　　And with earnest, noble strife,
　　Each its own Peculiar sought;Back to full, unbounded life
　　Sight and feeling soon were brought.Wherefore, if 'tis done, explore
　　How? why give the manner, name?Allah need create no more,
　　We his world ourselves can frame.
　　So, with morning pinions bright,
　　To thy mouth was I impell'd;Stamped with thousand seals by night,
　　Star-clear is the bond fast held.Paragons on earth are we
　　Both of grief and joy sublime,And a second sentence:--"Be!"
　　Parts us not a second time.
　　1815.-----SULEIKA.
　　WITH what inward joy, sweet lay,
　　I thy meaning have descried!Lovingly thou seem'st to say
　　That I'm ever by his side;
　　That he ever thinks of me,
　　That he to the absent givesAll his love's sweet ecstasy,
　　While for him alone she lives.
　　Yes, the mirror which reveals
　　Thee, my loved one, is my breast;This the bosom, where thy seals
　　Endless kisses have impress'd.
　　Numbers sweet, unsullied truth,
　　Chain me down in sympathy!Love's embodied radiant youth,
　　In the garb of poesy!
　　1819.*-----IN thousand forms mayst thou attempt surprise,
　　Yet, all-beloved-one, straight know I thee;Thou mayst with magic veils thy face disguise,
　　And yet, all-present-one, straight know I thee.
　　Upon the cypress' purest, youthful bud,
　　All-beauteous-growing-one, straight know I thee;In the canal's unsullied, living flood,
　　All-captivating-one, well know I thee.
　　When spreads the water-column, rising proud,
　　All-sportive one, how gladly know I thee;When, e'en in forming, is transform'd the cloud,
　　All-figure-changing-one, there know I thee.
　　Veil in the meadow-carpet's flowery charms,
　　All-checkered-starry-fair-one, know I thee;And if a plant extend its thousand arms,
　　O, all-embracing-one, there know I thee.
　　When on the mount is kindled morn's sweet light,
　　Straightway, all-gladdening-one, salute I thee,The arch of heaven o'er head grows pure and bright,--
　　All-heart-expanding-one, then breathe I thee.
　　That which my inward, outward sense proclaims,
　　Thou all-instructing-one, I know through thee;And if I utter Allah's hundred names,
　　A name with each one echoes, meant for thee.
　　1819.*-----IX. SAKE NAME.
　　THE CONVIVIAL BOOK.
　　CAN the Koran from Eternity be?
　　'Tis worth not a thought!Can the Koran a creation, then, be?
　　Of that, I know nought!Yet that the book of all books it must be,
　　I believe, as a Mussulman ought.That from Eternity wine, though, must be,
　　I ever have thought;That 'twas ordain'd, ere the Angels, to be,
　　As a truth may be taught.Drinkers, however these matters may be,
　　Gaze on God's face, fearing nought.
　　1815.-----YE'VE often, for our drunkenness,
　　Blamed us in ev'ry way,And, in abuse of drunkenness,
　　Enough can never say.Men, overcome by drunkenness,
　　Are wont to lie till day;And yet I find my drunkenness
　　All night-time make me stray;For, oh! 'tis Love's sweet drunkenness
　　That maketh me its prey,Which night and day, and day and night,
　　My heart must needs obey,--A heart that, in its drunkenness,
　　Pours forth full many a lay,So that no trifling drunkenness
　　Can dare assert its sway.Love, song, and wine's sweet drunkenness,
　　By night-time and by day,--How god-like is the drunkenness
　　That maketh me its prey!
　　1815.-----X. MATHAL NAME.
　　BOOK OF PARABLES.
　　FROM heaven there fell upon the foaming wave
　　A timid drop; the flood with anger roared,--
　　But God, its modest boldness to reward,Strength to the drop and firm endurance gave.Its form the mussel captive took,
　　And to its lasting glory and renown,
　　The pearl now glistens in our monarch's crown,With gentle gleam and loving look.
　　1819.*-----BULBUL'S song, through night hours cold,
　　Rose to Allah's throne on high;
　　To reward her melody,Giveth he a cage of gold.Such a cage are limbs of men,--
　　Though at first she feels confin'd,
　　Yet when all she brings to mind,Straight the spirit sings again.
　　1819.*-----IN the Koran with strange delightA peacock's feather met my sight:Thou'rt welcome in this holy place,The highest prize on earth's wide face!As in the stars of heaven, in thee,God's greatness in the small we see;For he whose gaze whole worlds bath bless'dHis eye hath even here impress'd,And the light down in beauty dress'd,So that e'en monarchs cannot hopeIn splendour with the bird to cope.Meekly enjoy thy happy lot,And so deserve that holy spot!
　　1815.-----ALL kinds of men, both small and great,A fine-spun web delight to create,And in the middle they take their place,And wield their scissors with wondrous grace.But if a besom should sweep that way:"What a most shameful thing," they say,--"They've crush'd a mighty palace to-day."
　　1815.-----IT IS GOOD.
　　IN Paradise while moonbeams play'd,
　　Jehovah found, in slumber deep,Adam fast sunk; He gently laid
　　Eve near him,--she, too, fell asleep.There lay they now, on earth's fair shrine,God's two most beauteous thoughts divine.--When this He saw, He cried:--'Tis Good!!!And scarce could move from where He stood.
　　No wonder, that our joy's completeWhile eye and eye responsive meet,When this blest thought of rapture moves us--That we're with Him who truly loves us,And if He cries:--Good, let it be!'Tis so for both, it seems to me.Thou'rt clasp'd within these arms of mine,Dearest of all God's thoughts divine!
　　1815.-----XI. PARIS NAME.
　　BOOK OF THE PARSEES.
　　THE BEQUEST OF THE ANCIENT PERSIAN FAITH.
　　BRETHREN, what bequest to you should comeFrom the lowly poor man, going home,Whom ye younger ones with patience tended,Whose last days ye honour'd and defended?
　　When we oft have seen the monarch ride,Gold upon him, gold on ev'ry side;Jewels on him, on his courtiers all,Thickly strewed as hailstones when they fall,
　　Have ye e'er known envy at the sight?And not felt your gaze become more bright,When the sun was, on the wings of morning,Darnawend's unnumber'd peaks adorning,
　　As he, bow-like, rose? How each eye dweltOn the glorious scene! I felt, I felt,Thousand times, as life's days fleeted by,Borne with him, the coming one, on high.
　　God upon His throne then to proclaim,Him, the life-fount's mighty Lord, to name,Worthily to prize that glorious sight,And to wander on beneath His light.
　　When the fiery orb was all defined,There I stood, as though in darkness, blind,Beat my breast, my quicken'd members threwOn the earth, brow-foremost, at the view.
　　Let this holy, great bequest rewardBrotherly good-will and kind regard:SOLEMN DUTY'S DAILY observation.--More than this, it needs no revelation.
　　If its gentle hands a new-born oneMove, then straightway turn it tow'rd the sun,--Soul and body dip in bath of fire!Then each morning's favour 'twill acquire.
　　To the living one, commit the dead,O'er the beast let earth and dust be spread,And, so far as may extend your might,What ye deem impure, conceal from sight.
　　Till your plains to graceful purity,That the sun with joy your labours see;When ye plant, your trees in rows contrive,For he makes the Regular to thrive.
　　E'en the floods that through the channel rushMust not fail in fulness or in gush;And as Senderud, from mountain high,Rises pure, in pureness must it die.
　　Not to weaken water's gentle fall,Carefully cleanse out the channels all;Salamander, snake, and rush, and reed,--All destroy,--each monster and each weed.
　　If thus pure ye earth and water keep,Through the air the sun will gladly peep,Where he, worthily enshrined in space,Worketh life, to life gives holy grace.
　　Ye, by toil on toil so sorely tried,Comfort take, the All is purified;And now man, as priest, may boldly dareFrom the stone God's image to prepare.
　　When the flame burns joyously and bright,Limbs are supple, radiant is the night;On the hearth when fire with ardour glows,Ripe the sap of plants and creatures grows.
　　Dragging wood, with rapture be it done,'Tis the seed of many an earthly sun;Plucking Pambeh, gladly may ye say:--This, as wick, the Holy will convey.
　　If ye meekly, in each burning lamp,See the nobler light's resplendent stamp,Ne'er will Fate prevent you, void of feeling,At God's throne at morningtide from kneeling.
　　This is Being's mighty signet, then,God's pure glass to angels and to men;Each word lisped the Highest's praise to sound,Ring in ring, united there is found.
　　From the shore of Senderud ascendeth,Up to Darnawend its pinions bendeth,As He dawns, with joy to greet His light,You with endless blessings to requite.

　　BOOK OF PARADISE.
　　THE PRIVILEGED MEN.
　　AFTER THE BATTLE OF BADE, BENEATH THE CANOPY OF HEAVEN.
　　[This battle was fought in the second year of the Hegira (A.A.623), between the followers of Mahomet, who numbered threehundred and thirteen, possessing two horses and seventy camels,and the 'idolaters,' or Meccans, whose forces amounted to ninehundred and fifty, including two hundred cavalry. The victoryremained with Mahomet, who lost fourteen men, while seventy ofthe enemy were slain. A great accession of strength ensued inconsequence to the Prophet, who pretended that miracles werewrought in his behalf in the battle, God having sent angels tofight on his side, and having also made his army to appear largerto the enemy than it really was.--See the Koran, chapter viii.,and ABULFEDA'S Life of Mahomet.]
　　MAHOMET (Speaks).
　　LET the foeman sorrow o'er his dead,
　　Ne'er will they return again to light;O'er our brethren let no tear be shed,
　　For they dwell above yon spheres so bright.
　　All the seven planets open throw
　　All their metal doors with mighty shock,And the forms of those we loved below
　　At the gates of Eden boldly knock.
　　There they find, with bliss ne'er dream'd before,
　　Glories that my flight first show'd to eye,When the wondrous steed my person bore
　　In one second through the realms on high.
　　Wisdom's trees, in cypress-order growing,
　　High uphold the golden apples sweet;Trees of life, their spreading shadows throwing,
　　Shade each blossoming plant, each flow'ry seat.
　　Now a balmy zephyr from the East
　　Brings the heavenly maidens to thy view;With the eye thou now dost taste the feast,
　　Soon the sight pervades thee through and through.
　　There they stand, to ask thee thy career:
　　Mighty plans? or dangerous bloody rout?Thou'rt a hero, know they,--for Thourt here,
　　What a hero?--This they'll fathom out.
　　By thy wounds soon clearly this is shown,
　　Wounds that write thy fame's undying story;Wounds the true believer mark alone,
　　When have perish'd joy and earthly glory.
　　To chiosks and arbors thou art brought,
　　Fill'd with checkered marble columns bright;To the noble grape-juice, solace-fraught,
　　They the guest with kindly sips invite.
　　Youth! Thou'rt welcome more than e'er was youth
　　All alike are radiant and serene;When thou tak'st one to thine heart with truth,
　　Of thy band she'll be the friend and queen.
　　So prepare thee for this place of rest,
　　Never can it now be changed again;Maids like these will ever make thee blest,
　　Wines like these will never harm thy brain.
　　1819.-----THE FAVOURED BEASTS.
　　Or beasts there have been chosen four
　　To come to Paradise,And there with saints for evermore
　　They dwell in happy wise.
　　Amongst them all the Ass stands first;
　　He comes with joyous stride,For to the Prophet-City erst
　　Did Jesus on him ride.
　　Half timid next a Wolf doth creep,
　　To whom Mahomet spake"Spoil not the poor man of his sheep,
　　The rich man's thou mayst take."
　　And then the brave and faithful Hound,
　　Who by his master kept,And slept with him the slumbers sound
　　The seven sleepers slept.
　　Abuherrira's Cat, too, here,
　　Purrs round his master blest,For holy must the beast appear
　　The Prophet hath caress'd.
　　1815.-----THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.
　　Six among the courtiers favour'dFly before the Caesar's fury,Who would as a god be worshipp'd,Though in truth no god appearing,For a fly prevents him everFrom enjoying food at table.Though with fans his servants scare it,They the fly can never banish.It torments him, stings, and troubles,And the festal board perplexes,Then returning like the heraldOf the olden crafty Fly-God."What!"--the striplings say together--"Shall a fly a god embarrass?
　　Shall a god drink, eat at table,Like us mortals? No, the Only,Who the sun and moon created,And the glowing stars arch'd o'er us,He is God,--we'll fly!"--The gentle,Lightly shod, and dainty striplingsDid a shepherd meet, and hide them,With himself, within a cavern.
　　And the sheep-dog will not leave them,--Scared away, his foot all-mangled,To his master still he presses,And he joins the hidden party,Joins the favorites of slumber.
　　And the prince, whom they had fled from,Fondly-furious, thinks of vengeance,And, discarding sword and fire,Has them walled-up in the cavern,Walled-up fast with bricks and mortar.
　　But the others slumber ever,And the Angel, their protector,Gives before God's throne this notice"To the right and left alternateHave I ever cared to turn them,That their fair and youthful membersBe not by the mould-damp injured;Clefts within the rocks I open'd,That the sun may, rising, setting,Keep their cheeks in youthful freshness."So they lie there, bless'd by Heaven.And, with forepaws sound and scatheless,Sleeps the dog in gentle slumber.
　　Years come round, and years fly onward,And the youths at length awaken,And the wall, which now had moldered,From its very age has fallen.And Jamblika says,--whose beautyFar exceedeth all the others,--When the fearful shepherd lingers:--"I will run, and food procure you,Life and piece of gold I'll wager!"--Ephebus had many a year nowOwn'd the teaching of the ProphetJesus (Peace be with the Good One!)
　　And he ran, and at the gatewayWere the warders and the others.Yet he to the nearest baker's,Seeking bread, went swiftly onwards.--"Rogue!" thus cried the baker--"hast thou,Youth, a treasure, then, discover'd?Give me,--for the gold betrays thee,--Give me half, to keep thy secret!"--
　　And they quarrel.--To the monarchComes the matter; and the monarchFain would halve it, like the baker.
　　Now the miracle is provenSlowly by a hundred tokens.He can e'en his right establishTo the palace he erected,For a pillar, when pierced open.
　　Leads to wealth he said 'twould lead to.Soon are gather'd there whole races,Their relationship to show him.And as great-grandfather, noblyStands Jamblika's youthful figure.
　　As of ancestors, he hears them,Speaking of his son and grandsons.His great-grandsons stand around him,Like a race of valiant mortals,Him to honour,--him, the youngest.And one token on anotherRises up, the proof completing;The identity is provenOf himself, and of his comrades.
　　Now returns he to the cavern,With him go both king and people.--Neither to the king nor peopleE'er returns that chosen mortal;For the Seven, who for ages--Eight was, with the dog, their number--Had from all the world been sunder'd,Gabriel's mysterious power,To the will of God obedient,Hath to Paradise conducted,--And the cave was closed for ever.

　　SONGS FROM VARIOUS PLAYS, ETC
　　-----FROM FAUST.
　　I.DEDICATION.
　　YE shadowy forms, again ye're drawing near,
　　So wont of yore to meet my troubled gaze!Were it in vain to seek to keep you here?
　　Loves still my heart that dream of olden days?Oh, come then! and in pristine force appear,
　　Parting the vapor mist that round me plays!My bosom finds its youthful strength again,Feeling the magic breeze that marks your train.
　　Ye bring the forms of happy days of yore,
　　And many a shadow loved attends you too;Like some old lay, whose dream was well nigh o'er,
　　First-love appears again, and friendship true;Upon life's labyrinthine path once more
　　Is heard the sigh, and grief revives anew;The friends are told, who, in their hour of pride,Deceived by fortune, vanish'd from my side.
　　No longer do they hear my plaintive song,
　　The souls to whom I sang in life's young day;Scatter'd for ever now the friendly throng,
　　And mute, alas! each sweet responsive lay.My strains but to the careless crowd belong,
　　Their smiles but sorrow to my heart convey;And all who heard my numbers erst with gladness,If living yet, roam o'er the earth in sadness.
　　Long buried yearnings in my breast arise,
　　Yon calm and solemn spirit-realm to gain;Like the AEONIAN harp's sweet melodies,
　　My murmuring song breathes forth its changeful strain.A trembling seizes me, tears fill mine eyes,
　　And softer grows my rugged heart amain.All I possess far distant seems to be,The vanish'd only seems reality.
　　II.PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN.
　　THE ARCHANGELS' SONG.
　　RAPHAEL.
　　THE sun still chaunts, as in old time,
　　With brother-spheres in choral song,And with his thunder-march sublime
　　Moves his predestined course along.Strength find the angels in his sight,
　　Though he by none may fathomed be;Still glorious is each work of might
　　As when first form'd in majesty.
　　GABRIEL.
　　And swift and swift, in wondrous guise,
　　Revolves the earth in splendour bright,The radiant hues of Paradise
　　Alternating with deepest night.From out the gulf against the rock,
　　In spreading billows foams the ocean,--And cliff and sea with mighty shock,
　　The spheres whirl round in endless motion.
　　MICHAEL.
　　And storms in emulation growl
　　From land to sea, from sea to land,And fashion, as they wildly howl,
　　A circling, wonder-working band.Destructive flames in mad career
　　Precede Thy thunders on their way;Yet, Lord, Thy messengers revere
　　The soft mutations of Thy day.
　　THE THREE.
　　Strength find the angels in Thy sight,
　　Though none may hope to fathom Thee;Still glorious are Thy works of might,
　　As when first form'd in majesty.
　　III.CHORUS OF ANGELS.
　　CHRIST is arisen!
　　Mortal, all hail!Thou, of Earth's prison
　　Dreary and frail,Bursting the veil,
　　Proudly hast risen!
　　CHORUS OF WOMEN.
　　Rich spices and myrrh,
　　To embalm Him we brought;His corpse to inter
　　His true followers sought.In pure cerements shrin'd,
　　'Twas placed in the bierBut, alas! we now find
　　That Christ is not here.
　　CHORUS OF ANGELS.
　　Christ is arisen!
　　Speechless His love.Who to Earth's prison
　　Came from above,Trials to prove.
　　Now is He risen!
　　CHORUS OF YOUTHS.
　　Death's gloomy portal
　　Now hath He rended,--Living, immortal,
　　Heavenward ascended;Freed from His anguish,
　　Sees He God's throne;We still must languish,
　　Earthbound, alone.Now that He's reft us,
　　Heart-sad we pine;Why hast Thou left us,
　　Master divine?
　　CHORUS OF ANGELS.
　　Christ is arisen,
　　Death hath He slain;
　　Burst ye your prison,
　　Rend ye each chain!
　　Songs of praise lead ye,--
　　Love to show, heed ye,--
　　Hungry ones feed ye,--
　　Preaching, on speed ye,--
　　Coming joys plead ye,--Then is the Master near,Then is He here!
　　IV.CHORUS OF SPIRITS.
　　VANISH, dark clouds on high,
　　Offspring of night!Let a more radiant beamThrough the blue ether gleam,
　　Charming the sight!Would the dark clouds on high
　　Melt into air!Stars glimmer tenderly,
　　Planets more fair
　　Shed their soft light.Spirits of heav'nly birth,Fairer than sons of earth,Quivering emotions true
　　Hover above;Yearning affections, too,
　　In their train move.See how the spirit-band,By the soft breezes fann'd,Covers the smiling land,--Covers the leafy grove,Where happy lovers rove,Deep in a dream of love,True love that never dies!Bowers on bowers rise,
　　Soft tendrils twine;While from the press escapes,Born of the juicy grapes,
　　Foaming, the wine;And as the current flowsO'er the bright stones it goes,--Leaving the hilly lands
　　Far, far behind,--Into a sea expands,
　　Loving to windRound the green mountain's base;And the glad-winged race,
　　Rapture sip in,As they the sunny light,And the fair islands bright,
　　Hasten to win,That on the billows playWith sweet deceptive ray,Where in glad choral songShout the exulting throng;Where on the verdant plain
　　Dancers we see,Spreading themselves amain
　　Over the lea.Some boldly climbing are
　　O'er the steep brake,Others are floating far
　　O'er the smooth lake.All for a purpose move,
　　All with life teem,While the sweet stars above
　　Blissfully gleam.
　　V.MARGARET AT HER SPINNING-WHEEL.
　　MY heart is sad,
　　My peace is o'er;I find it never
　　And nevermore.
　　When gone is he,The grave I see;The world's wide allIs turned to gall.
　　Alas, my head
　　Is well-nigh crazed;My feeble mind
　　Is sore amazed.
　　My heart is sad,
　　My peace is o'er;I find it never
　　And nevermore.
　　For him from the window
　　Alone I spy;For him alone
　　From home go I.
　　His lofty step,
　　His noble form,His mouth's sweet smile,
　　His glances warm,
　　His voice so fraught
　　With magic bliss,His hand's soft pressure,
　　And, ah, his kiss!
　　My heart is sad,
　　My peace is o'er;I find it never
　　And nevermore.
　　My bosom yearns
　　For his form so fair;Ah, could I clasp him
　　And hold him there!
　　My kisses sweet
　　Should stop his breath,And 'neath his kisses
　　I'd sink in death!
　　VI.SCENE--A GARDEN,
　　Margaret. Faust.
　　MARGARET.
　　DOST thou believe in God?
　　FAUST.
　　Doth mortal live
　　Who dares to say that he believes in God?Go, bid the priest a truthful answer give,
　　Go, ask the wisest who on earth e'er trod,--Their answer will appear to beGiven alone in mockery.
　　MARGARET.
　　Then thou dost not believe? This sayest thou?
　　FAUST.
　　Sweet love, mistake not what I utter now!Who knows His name?Who dares proclaim:--Him I believe?Who so can feelHis heart to steelTo sari believe Him not?The All-Embracer,The All-Sustained,Holds and sustains He notThee, me, Himself?
　　Hang not the heavens their arch overhead?Lies not the earth beneath us, firm?Gleam not with kindly glancesEternal stars on high?Looks not mine eye deep into thine?And do not all thingsCrowd on thy head and heart,And round thee twine, in mystery eterne,Invisible, yet visible?Fill, then, thy heart, however vast, with this,And when the feeling perfecteth thy bliss,O, call it what thou wilt,Call it joy! heart! love! God!No name for it I know!'Tis feeling all--nought else;Name is but sound and smoke,Obscuring heaven's bright glow.
　　VII.MARGARET, Placing fresh flowers in the flower-pots.
　　O THOU well-tried in grief,
　　Grant to thy child relief,And view with mercy this unhappy one!
　　The sword within thy heart,
　　Speechless with bitter smart,Thou Lookest up towards thy dying son.
　　Thou look'st to God on high,
　　And breathest many a sighO'er his and thy distress, thou holy One!
　　Who e'er can know
　　The depth of woe
　　Piercing my very bone?The sorrows that my bosom fill,Its trembling, its aye-yearning will,
　　Are known to thee, to thee alone!
　　Wherever I may go,
　　With woe, with woe, with woe,My bosom sad is aching!
　　I scarce alone can creep,
　　I weep, I weep, I weep,My very heart is breaking.
　　The flowers at my window
　　My falling tears bedewed,When I, at dawn of morning,
　　For thee these flow'rets strewed.
　　When early to my chamber
　　The cheerful sunbeams stole,I sat upon my pallet,
　　In agony of soul.
　　Help! rescue me from death and misery!
　　Oh, thou well-tried in grief,
　　Grant to thy child relief,And view with mercy my deep agony!
　　FROM FAUST--SECOND PART.

　　ARIEL.
　　WHEN in spring the gentle rain
　　Breathes into the flower new birth,When the green and happy plain
　　Smiles upon the sons of earth,Haste to give what help we may,
　　Little elves of wondrous might!Whether good or evil they,
　　Pity for them feels the sprite.
　　II.CHORUS OF SPIRITS.
　　WHEN the moist and balmy gale
　　Round the verdant meadow sighs,Odors sweet in misty veil
　　At the twilight-hour arise.Murmurings soft of calm repose
　　Rock the heart to child-like rest,And the day's bright portals close
　　On the eyes with toil oppress'd.
　　Night already reigns o'er all,
　　Strangely star is link'd to star;Planets mighty, sparkling small,
　　Glitter near and gleam afar.Gleam above in clearer night,
　　Glitter in the glassy sea;Pledging pure and calm delight,
　　Rules the moon in majesty.
　　Now each well-known hour is over,
　　Joy and grief have pass'd away;Feel betimes! thoult then recover:
　　Trust the newborn eye of day.Vales grow verdant, hillocks teem,
　　Shady nooks the bushes yield,And with waving, silvery gleam,
　　Rocks the harvest in the field.
　　Wouldst thou wish for wish obtain,
　　Look upon yon glittering ray!Lightly on thee lies the chain,
　　Cast the shell of sleep away!Tarry not, but be thou bold,
　　When the many loiter still;All with ease may be controll'd
　　By the man of daring will.
　　III.ARIEL.
　　HARK! the storm of hours draws near,Loudly to the spirit-earSigns of coming day appear.Rocky gates are wildly crashing,Phoebus' wheels are onward dashing;
　　(A wonderful noise proclaims the approach of the sun.)
　　Light doth mighty sounds beget!Pealing loud as rolling thunder,Eye and ear it fills with wonder,
　　Though itself unconscious yet.Downward steals it,'mongst the flowersSeeking deeper, stiller bowers,'Mongst the foliage, 'neath the rock;Thou'lt be deafened by the shock!-----FROM FAUST--SECOND PART.
　　SCENE THE LAST.
　　ANGELS.[Hovering in the higher regions of air, and hearing the immortalpart of Faust.]
　　THE spirit-region's noble limb
　　Hath 'scaled the Archfiend's power;For we have strength to rescue him
　　Who labours ev'ry hour.And if he feels within his breast
　　A ray of love from heaven.He's met by all the squadron blest
　　With welcome gladly given.
　　THE YOUNGER ANGELS.
　　Yonder roses, from the holyHands of penitents so lowly,Help'd to render us victorious,And to do the deed all-glorious;For they gain'd us this soul-treasure.
　　Evil ones those roses banish'd,
　　Devils, when we met them, vanish'd.Spirits felt love's pangs with pleasure,Where hell's torments used to dwell;E'en the hoary king of hellFelt sharp torments through him run.Shout for joy! the prize is won.
　　THE MORE PERFECT ANGELS.
　　Strains of mortality
　　Long have oppress'd us;Pure could they ever be,
　　If of asbestos.If mighty spirit-strength
　　Elements everKnew how to seize at length,
　　Angels could neverLink'd twofold natures move,
　　Where single-hearted;By nought but deathless love
　　Can they be parted.
　　THE YOUNGER ANGELS.
　　See where a spirit-race
　　Bursts on the sight!Dimly their forms I trace
　　Round the far height.Each cloud becometh clear,While the bright troops appear
　　Of the blest boys,
　　From the Earth's burden free,In a glad company
　　Drinking in joys,Born of the world above,
　　Springtime and bliss.May they forerunners proveOf a more perfect love,
　　Link'd on to this!
　　THE BEATIFIED CHILDREN.
　　Thus as a chrysalis
　　Gladly we gain him,And as a pledge of bliss
　　Safely retain him;When from the shell he's free
　　Whereby he's tainted,Perfect and fair he'll be,
　　Holy and sainted.
　　DOCTOR MARINAS.(In the highest, purest cell.)
　　Wide is the prospect here,
　　Raised is the soul;Women on high appear,
　　Seeking their goal.
　　'Mongat them the radiant one,
　　Queen of the skies,In her bright starry crown
　　Greets my glad eyes.
　　(With ecstasy.)
　　Thou who art of earth the queen.
　　Let me, 'neath the blueHeav'nly canopy serene
　　Thy sweet mystery view!Grant the gentle solemn force
　　Which the breast can move.And direct our onward course
　　Tow'rd thy perfect love.Dauntless let our courage be,
　　At thy bright behest;Mild our ardour suddenly,
　　When thou bidd'st us rest.Virgin, type of holiness,
　　Mother, honour-crown'd,Thou whom we as queen confess,
　　Godlike and renowned.
　　Round her, in gentle play,
　　Light clouds are stealing;Penitents fair are they,
　　Who, humbly kneeling,Sip in the ether sweet,As they for grace entreat.
　　Thou, who art from passions free,
　　Kindly art inclin'd,When the sons of frailty
　　Seek thee, meek in mind.
　　Borne by weakness' stream along,
　　Hard it is to save them;Who can burst lust's chains so strong,
　　That, alas, enslave them?O how soon the foot may slip,
　　When the smooth ground pressing!O, how false are eye and lip,
　　False a breath caressing!
　　MATER GLORLOSA hovers past.
　　CHORUS OF PENITENT WOMEN.
　　To bring realms on high
　　In majesty soaring,O, hark to our cry
　　Thy pity imploring,Thou help to the cheerless,In glory so peerless!
　　MAGNA PECCATRIX (St. Luke vii. 36).
　　By the love, which o'er the feet
　　Of thy God-transfigur'd SonDropp'd the team, like balsam sweet,
　　Spite of ev'ry scornful one;By the box of ointment rare,
　　Whence the drops so fragrant fell;By the locks, whose gentle care
　　Dried His holy members well--

　　By the well where Abram erst
　　Drove his flocks to drink their fill;By the bucket which the thirst
　　Of the Saviour served to still;By the fountain, balm-exhaling,
　　That from yon bright region flows,Ever clear and never failing.
　　As round ev'ry world it goes--
　　MARIA AEGYPTIACA (Acta Sanctorum).
　　By the sacred spot immortal,
　　Where the Lord's remains they plac'd;By the arm, that from the portal
　　Drove me back with warning haste;By my forty years of lowly
　　Penance in a desert land;By the farewell greetings holy
　　That I wrote upon the sand--
　　THE THREE.
　　Thou who ne'er thy radiant face
　　From the greatest sinners hides,Thou who Thine atoning grace
　　Through eternity provident,
　　Let this soul, by virtue stirr'd,
　　Self-forgetful though when living,That perceived not that it err'd,
　　Feel thy mercy, sin forgiving!
　　UNA POENITENTIUM.(Once named Margaret, pressing near them.)
　　Oh radiance-spreading One,
　　Who equall'd art by none,In mercy view mine ecstasy!
　　For he whom erst I loved,
　　No more by sorrow proved,Returns at length to me!
　　BEATIFIED CHILDREN.(Approaching as they hover round.)
　　He now in strength of limb
　　Far doth outweigh us,And, as we tended him,
　　So will repay us.Early removed were we
　　Far from life's story;Train'd now himself, will he
　　Train us in glory.
　　THE PENITENT, once named Margaret.
　　Link'd with the noble band of spirits,
　　Scarce can the new one feel or seeThe radiant life he now inherits,
　　So like that holy band is he.See how he bursts each bond material,
　　And parts the olden veil at length,--In vesture clad of grace ethereal,
　　Comes in the glow of youthful strength.Oh, let me guide his steps victorious,
　　While dazzled by the new-born light.
　　MATER GLORIOSA.
　　Come! raise thyself to spheres more glorious,He'll follow when thou matzoth his sight.
　　DOCTOR MARINAS.(Prostrated in adoration.)
　　O repentant sinful ones,
　　On that bright face gaze ye,And, in grateful orisons,
　　Your blest fortune praise ye!Be each virtue of the mind
　　To thy service given!Virgin, mother, be thou kind!
　　Goddess, queen of heaven!
　　CHORUS MYSTICS.
　　Each thing of mortal birth
　　Is but a typeWhat was of feeble worth

　　Draws us on high.

　　ACT IV. SCENE 5.
　　SONG OF THE FATES.
　　YE children of mortalsThe deities dread!The mastery hold theyIn hands all-eternal,And use them, unquestioned,What manner they like.
　　Let him fear them doubly,Whom they have uplifted!On cliffs and on clouds, oh,Round tables all-golden,he seats are made ready.
　　When rises contention,The guests are humid downwardsWith shame and dishonorTo deep depths of midnight,And vainly await they,Bound fast in the darkness,A just condemnation.
　　But they remain everIn firmness unshakenRound tables all-golden.On stride they from mountainTo mountain far distant:From out the abysses'Dark jaws, the breath risesOf torment-choked TitansUp tow'rds them, like incenseIn light clouds ascending.
　　The rulers immortalAvert from whole peoplesTheir blessing-fraught glances,And shun, in the children,To trace the once cherish'd,Still, eloquent featuresTheir ancestors wore.
　　Thus chanted the Parae;The old man, the banish'd,In gloomy vault lying,Their song overheareth,Sons, grandsons remembereth,And shaketh his head.-----FROM GOTZ VON BERLICHINGEN.

　　Up! up!
　　On! on!His arms rattle loudly,His wings rustle proudly,And flames fill his eyes.
　　Then finds he each bosom
　　Defenseless and bare;They gladly receive him
　　And welcome him there.The point of his arrows
　　He lights in the glow;They clasp him and kiss him
　　And fondle him so.He e o! Pap!

　　CLARA winds a skein, and sings with Brackenburg.
　　THE drum gives the signal!
　　Loud rings the shrill fife!My love leads his troops on
　　Full arm'd for the strife,While his hand grasps his lanceAs they proudly advance.
　　My bosom pants wildly!My blood hotly flows!Oh had I a doublet,A helmet, and hose!
　　Through the gate with bold footstep
　　I after him hied,--Each province, each country
　　Explored by his side.The coward foe trembledThen rattled our shot:What bliss e'er resembled
　　A soldier's glad lot!
　　ACT III.

　　Gladness
　　And sadnessAnd pensiveness blending

　　BOOK II., CHAP. XIII.
　　WHO never eat with tears his bread,
　　Who never through night's heavy hoursSat weeping on his lonely bed,--
　　He knows you not, ye heavenly powers!
　　Through you the paths of life we gain,
　　Ye let poor mortals go astray,And then abandon them to pain,--
　　E'en here the penalty we pay,-----WHO gives himself to solitude,
　　Soon lonely will remain;Each lives, each loves in joyous mood,
　　And leaves him to his pain.
　　Yes! leave me to my grief!Were solitude's relief
　　E'er granted me,
　　Alone I should not be.
　　A lover steals, on footstep light,
　　To learn if his love's alone;Thus o'er me steals, by day and night,
　　Anguish before unknown,Thus o'er me steals deep grief.Ah, when I find relief
　　Within the tomb so lonely,
　　Will rest be met with only!-----BOOK IV., CHAP. XI.
　　My grief no mortals know,
　　Except the yearning!Alone, a prey to woe,
　　All pleasure spurning,Up tow'rds the sky I throw
　　A gaze discerning.
　　He who my love can know
　　Seems ne'er returning;With strange and fiery glow
　　My heart is burning.My grief no mortals know,
　　Except the yearning!-----BOOK V., CHAP. X.
　　SING no more in mournful tones
　　Of the loneliness of night;For 'tis made, ye beauteous ones,
　　For all social pleasures bright.
　　As of old to man a wife
　　As his better half was given,So the night is half our life,
　　And the fairest under heaven.
　　How can ye enjoy the day,
　　Which obstructs our rapture's tide?Let it waste itself away;
　　Worthless 'tis for aught beside.
　　But when in the darkling hours
　　From the lamp soft rays are glowing,And from mouth to mouth sweet showers,
　　Now of jest, now love, are flowing,--
　　When the nimble, wanton boy,
　　Who so wildly spends his days,Oft amid light sports with joy
　　O'er some trifling gift delays,?
　　When the nightingale is singing
　　Strains the lover holds so dear,Though like sighs and wailings ringing
　　In the mournful captive's ear,--
　　With what heart-emotion blest
　　Do ye hearken to the bell,Wont of safety and of rest
　　With twelve solemn strokes to tell!
　　Therefore in each heavy hour,
　　Let this precept fill your heart:O'er each day will sorrow loud,
　　Rapture ev'ry night impart.-----EPILOGUE TO SCHILLER'S "SONG OF THE BELL."
　　[This fine piece, written originally in 1805, on Schiller'sdeath, was altered and recast by Goethe in 1815, on the occasionof the performance on the stage of the Song of the Bell. Hencethe allusion in the last verse.]
　　To this city joy reveal it!
　　Peace as its first signal peal it!
　　(Song of the Bell--concluding lines.)
　　AND so it proved! The nation felt, ere long,
　　That peaceful signal, and, with blessings fraught,A new-born joy appear'd; in gladsome song
　　To hail the youthful princely pair we sought;While in a living, ever-swelling throng
　　Mingled the crowds from ev'ry region brought,And on the stage, in festal pomp array'dThe HOMAGE OF THE ARTS * we saw displayed.
　　(* The title of a lyric piece composed by Schiller in honour ofthe marriage of the hereditary Prince of Weimar to the PrincessMaria of Russia, and performed in 1804.)
　　When, lo! a fearful midnight sound I hear,
　　That with a dull and mournful echo rings.And can it be that of our friend so dear
　　It tells, to whom each wish so fondly clings?Shall death overcome a life that all revere?
　　How such a loss to all confusion brings!How such a parting we must ever rue!The world is weeping,--shall not we weep too?
　　He was our own! How social, yet how great
　　Seem'd in the light of day his noble mind!How was his nature, pleasing yet sedate,
　　Now for glad converse joyously incline,Then swiftly changing, spirit-fraught, elate,
　　Life's plan with deep-felt meaning it design'd,Fruitful alike in counsel and in deed!This have we proved, this tasted, in our need.
　　He was our own! O may that thought so blest
　　Overcome the voice of wailing and of woeHe might have sought the Lasting, safe at rest
　　In harbour, when the tempest ceased to blow.Meanwhile his mighty spirit onward press'd
　　Where goodness, beauty, truth, for ever grow;And in his rear, in shadowy outline, layThe vulgar, which we all, alas, obey!
　　Now doth he deck the garden-turret fair
　　Where the stars' language first illuded his soul,As secretly yet clearly through the air
　　On the eterne, the living sense it stole;And to his own, and our great profit, there
　　Exchangeth he the seasons as they roll;Thus nobly doth he vanquish, with renown,The twilight and the night that weigh us down.
　　Brighter now glow'd his cheek, and still more bright.
　　With that unchanging, ever-youthful glow,--That courage which overcomes, in hard-fought fight,
　　Sooner or later, ev'ry earthly foe--That faith which, soaring to the realms of light,
　　Now boldly Presseth on, now bendeth low,So that the good may work, wax, thrive amain,So that the day the noble may attain.
　　Yet, though so skill'd, of such transcendent worth,
　　This boarded scaffold doth he not despise;The fate that on its axis turns the earth
　　From day to night, here shows he to our eyes,Raising, through many a work of glorious birth,
　　Art and the artist's fame up tow'rd the skies.He fills with blossoms of the noblest strife,With life itself, this effigy of life.
　　His giant-step, as ye full surely knew,
　　Measured the circle of the will and deed,Each country's changing thoughts and morals too,
　　The darksome book with clearness could he read;Yet how he, breathless 'midst his friends so true,
　　Despaired in sorrow, scarce from pain was freed,--All this have we, in sadly happy years,For he was ours, bewailed with feeling tears.
　　When from the agonizing weight of grief
　　He raised his eyes upon the world again,We show'd him how his thoughts might find relief
　　From the uncertain present's heavy chain,Gave his fresh-kindled mind a respite brief,
　　With kindly skill beguiling ev'ry pain,And e'en at eve, when setting was his sun,From his wan cheeks a gentle smile we won.
　　Full early had he read the stern decree,
　　Sorrow and death to him, alas, were known;Ofttimes recovering, now departed he,--
　　Dread tidings, that our hearts had fear'd to own!Yet his transfigured being now can see
　　Itself, e'en here on earth, transfigured grown.What his own age reproved, and deem'd a crime,Hath been ennobled now by death and time.
　　And many a soul that with him strove in fight,
　　And his great merit grudged to recognise,Now feels the impress of his wondrous might,
　　And in his magic fetters gladly lies;E'en to the highest bath he winged his flight,
　　In close communion link'd with all we prize.Extol him then! What mortals while they liveBut half receive, posterity shall give.
　　Thus is he left us, who so long ago,--
　　Ten years, alas, already!--turn'd from earth;We all, to our great joy, his precepts know,
　　Oh may the world confess their priceless worth!In swelling tide tow'rd every region flow
　　The thoughts that were his own peculiar birth;He gleams like some departing meteor bright,Combining, with his own, eternal light.-----
　　L'ENVOl.
　　-----Now, gentle reader, is our journey ended,
　　Mute is our minstrel, silent is our song;Sweet the bard's voice whose strains our course attended,
　　Pleasant the paths he guided us along.Now must we part,--Oh word all full of sadness,Changing to pensive retrospect our gladness!
　　Reader, farewell! we part perchance for ever,
　　Scarce may I hope to meet with thee again;But e'en though fate our fellowship may sever,
　　Reader, will aught to mark that tie remain?Yes! there is left one sad sweet bond of union,--Sorrow at parting links us in communion.
　　But of the twain, the greater is my sorrow,--
　　Reader, and why?--Bethink thee of the sun,How, when he sets, he waiteth for the morrow,
　　Proudly once more his giant-race to run,--Yet, e'en when set, a glow behind him leaving,Gladdening the spirit, which had else been grieving.
　　Thus mayst thou feel, for thou to GOETHE only
　　Baldest farewell, nor camest aught for me.Twofold my parting, leaving me all lonely,--
　　I now must part from GOETHE and from thee,Parting at once from comrade and from leader,--Farewell, great minstrel! farewell, gentle reader!
　　Hush'd is the harp, its music sunk in slumbers,Memory alone can waken now its numbers.

GUY DE MAUPASSANT
Of the French writers of romance of the latter part of the
nineteenth century no one made a reputation as quickly as did Guy
de Maupassant. Not one has preserved that reputation with more
ease, not only during life, but in death. None so completely
hides his personality in his glory. In an epoch of the utmost
publicity, in which the most insignificant deeds of a celebrated
man are spied, recorded, and commented on, the author of "Boule
de Suif," of "Pierre et Jean," of "Notre Coeur," found a way of
effacing his personality in his work.
Of De Maupassant we know that he was born in Normandy about 1850;
that he was the favorite pupil, if one may so express it, the
literary protege, of Gustave Flaubert; that he made his debut
late in 1880, with a novel inserted in a small collection,
published by Emile Zola and his young friends, under the title:
"The Soirees of Medan"; that subsequently he did not fail to
publish stories and romances every year up to 1891, when a
disease of the brain struck him down in the fullness of
production; and that he died, finally, in 1893, without having
recovered his reason.
We know, too, that he passionately loved a strenuous physical
life and long journeys, particularly long journeys upon the sea.
He owned a little sailing yacht, named after one of his books,
"Bel-Ami," in which he used to sojourn for weeks and months.
These meager details are almost the only ones that have been
gathered as food for the curiosity of the public.
I leave the legendary side, which is always in evidence in the
case of a celebrated man,--that gossip, for example, which avers
that Maupassant was a high liver and a worldling. The very number
of his volumes is a protest to the contrary. One could not write
so large a number of pages in so small a number of years without
the virtue of industry, a virtue incompatible with habits of
dissipation. This does not mean that the writer of these great
romances had no love for pleasure and had not tasted the world,
but that for him these were secondary things. The psychology of
his work ought, then, to find an interpretation other than that
afforded by wholly false or exaggerated anecdotes. I wish to
indicate here how this work, illumined by the three or four
positive data which I have given, appears to me to demand it.
And first, what does that anxiety to conceal his personality
prove, carried as it was to such an extreme degree? The answer
rises spontaneously in the minds of those who have studied
closely the history of literature. The absolute silence about
himself, preserved by one whose position among us was that of a
Tourgenief, or of a Merimee, and of a Moliere or a Shakespeare
among the classic great, reveals, to a person of instinct, a
nervous sensibility of extreme depth. There are many chances for
an artist of his kind, however timid, or for one who has some
grief, to show the depth of his emotion. To take up again only
two of the names just cited, this was the case with the author of
"Terres Vierges," and with the writer of "Colomba."
A somewhat minute analysis of the novels and romances of
Maupassant would suffice to demonstrate, even if we did not know
the nature of the incidents which prompted them, that he also
suffered from an excess of nervous emotionalism. Nine times out
of ten, what is the subject of these stories to which freedom of
style gives the appearance of health? A tragic episode. I cite,
at random, "Mademoiselle Fifi," "La Petite Roque," "Inutile
Beaute," "Le Masque," "Le Horla," "L'Epreuve," "Le Champ
d'Oliviers," among the novels, and among the romances, "Une Vie,"
"Pierre et Jean," "Fort comme la Mort," "Notre Coeur." His
imagination aims to represent the human being as imprisoned in a
situation at once insupportable and inevitable. The spell of this
grief and trouble exerts such a power upon the writer that he
ends stories commenced in pleasantry with some sinister drama.
Let me instance "Saint-Antonin," "A Midnight Revel," "The Little
Cask," and "Old Amable." You close the book at the end of these
vigorous sketches, and feel how surely they point to constant
suffering on the part of him who executed them.
This is the leading trait in the literary physiognomy of
Maupassant, as it is the leading and most profound trait in the
psychology of his work, viz, that human life is a snare laid by
nature, where joy is always changed to misery, where noble words
and the highest professions of faith serve the lowest plans and
the most cruel egoism, where chagrin, crime, and folly are
forever on hand to pursue implacably our hopes, nullify our
virtues, and annihilate our wisdom. But this is not the whole.
Maupassant has been called a literary nihilist--but (and this is
the second trait of his singular genius) in him nihilism finds
itself coexistent with an animal energy so fresh and so intense
that for a long time it deceives the closest observer. In an
eloquent discourse, pronounced over his premature grave, Emile
Zola well defined this illusion: "We congratulated him," said he,
"upon that health which seemed unbreakable, and justly credited
him with the soundest constitution of our band, as well as with
the clearest mind and the sanest reason. It was then that this
frightful thunderbolt destroyed him."
It is not exact to say that the lofty genius of De Maupassant was
that of an absolutely sane man. We comprehend it to-day, and, on
re-reading him, we find traces everywhere of his final malady.
But it is exact to say that this wounded genius was, by a
singular circumstance, the genius of a robust man. A physiologist
would without doubt explain this anomaly by the coexistence of a
nervous lesion, light at first, with a muscular, athletic
temperament. Whatever the cause, the effect is undeniable. The
skilled and dainty pessimism of De Maupassant was accompanied by
a vigor and physique very unusual. His sensations are in turn
those of a hunter and of a sailor, who have, as the old French
saying expressively puts it, "swift foot, eagle eye," and who are
attuned to all the whisperings of nature.
The only confidences that he has ever permitted his pen to tell
of the intoxication of a free, animal existence are in the
opening pages of the story entitled "Mouche," where he recalls,
among the sweetest memories of his youth, his rollicking canoe
parties upon the Seine, and in the description in "La Vie
Errante" of a night spent on the sea,--"to be alone upon the
water under the sky, through a warm night,"--in which he speaks
of the happiness of those "who receive sensations through the
whole surface of their flesh, as they do through their eyes,
their mouth, their ears, and sense of smell."
His unique and too scanty collection of verses, written in early
youth, contains the two most fearless, I was going to say the
most ingenuous, paeans, perhaps, that have been written since the
Renaissance: "At the Water's Edge" (Au Bord de l'Eau) and the
"Rustic Venus" (La Venus Rustique). But here is a paganism whose
ardor, by a contrast which brings up the ever present duality of
his nature, ends in an inexpressible shiver of scorn:
     "We look at each other, astonished, immovable,
        And both are so pale that it makes us fear."
      *    *    *    *    *    *    *
"Alas! through all our senses slips life itself away."
This ending of the "Water's Edge" is less sinister than the
murder and the vision of horror which terminate the pantheistic
hymn of the "Rustic Venus." Considered as documents revealing the
cast of mind of him who composed them, these two lyrical essays
are especially significant, since they were spontaneous. They
explain why De Maupassant, in the early years of production,
voluntarily chose, as the heroes of his stories, creatures very
near to primitive existence, peasants, sailors, poachers, girls
of the farm, and the source of the vigor with which he describes
these rude figures. The robustness of his animalism permits him
fully to imagine all the simple sensations of these beings, while
his pessimism, which tinges these sketches of brutal customs with
an element of delicate scorn, preserves him from coarseness. It
is this constant and involuntary antithesis which gives unique
value to those Norman scenes which have contributed so much to
his glory. It corresponds to, those two contradictory tendencies
in literary art, which seek always to render life in motion with
the most intense coloring, and still to make more and more subtle
the impression of this life. How is one ambition to be satisfied
at the same time as the other, since all gain in color and
movement brings about a diminution of sensibility, and
conversely? The paradox of his constitution permitted to
Maupassant this seemingly impossible accord, aided as he was by
an intellect whose influence was all powerful upon his
development--the writer I mention above, Gustave Flaubert.
These meetings of a pupil and a master, both great, are indeed
rare. They present, in fact, some troublesome conditions, the
first of which is a profound analogy between two types of
thought. There must have been, besides, a reciprocity of
affection, which does not often obtain between a renowned senior
who is growing old and an obscure junior, whose renown is
increasing. From generation to generation, envy reascends no less
than she redescends. For the honor of French men of letters, let
us add that this exceptional phenomenon has manifested itself
twice in the nineteenth century. Merimee, whom I have also named,
received from Stendhal, at twenty, the same benefits that
Maupassant received from Flaubert.
The author of "Une Vie" and the writer of "Clara Jozul" resemble
each other, besides, in a singular and analogous circumstance.
Both achieved renown at the first blow, and by a masterpiece
which they were able to equal but never surpass. Both were
misanthropes early in life, and practised to the end the ancient
advice that the disciple of Beyle carried upon his seal: <gr
memneso apistein>--"Remember to distrust." And, at the same time,
both had delicate, tender hearts under this affectation of
cynicism, both were excellent sons, irreproachable friends,
indulgent masters, and both were idolized by their inferiors.
Both were worldly, yet still loved a wanderer's life; both joined
to a constant taste for luxury an irresistible desire for
solitude. Both belonged to the extreme left of the literature of
their epoch, but kept themselves from excess and used with a
judgment marvelously sure the sounder principles of their school.
They knew how to remain lucid and classic, in taste as much as in
form--Merimee through all the audacity of a fancy most exotic,
and Maupassant in the realism of the most varied and exact
observation. At a little distance they appear to be two patterns,
identical in certain traits, of the same family of minds, and
Tourgenief, who knew and loved the one and the other, never
failed to class them as brethren.
They are separated, however, by profound differences, which
perhaps belong less to their nature than to that of the masters
from whom they received their impulses: Stendhal, so alert, so
mobile, after a youth passed in war and a ripe age spent in
vagabond journeys, rich in experiences, immediate and personal;
Flaubert so poor in direct impressions, so paralyzed by his
health, by his family, by his theories even, and so rich in
reflections, for the most part solitary.
Among the theories of the anatomist of "Madame Bovary," there are
two which appear without ceasing in his Correspondence, under one
form or another, and these are the ones which are most strongly
evident in the art of De Maupassant. We now see the consequences
which were inevitable by reason of them, endowed as Maupassant
was with a double power of feeling life bitterly, and at the same
time with so much of animal force. The first theory bears upon
the choice of personages and the story of the romance, the second
upon the character of the style. The son of a physician, and
brought up in the rigors of scientific method, Flaubert believed
this method to be efficacious in art as in science. For instance,
in the writing of a romance, he seemed to be as scientific as in
the development of a history of customs, in which the essential
is absolute exactness and local color. He therefore naturally
wished to make the most scrupulous and detailed observation of
the environment.
Thus is explained the immense labor in preparation which his
stories cost him--the story of "Madame Bovary," of "The
Sentimental Education," and "Bouvard and Pecuchet," documents
containing as much minutiae as his historical stories. Beyond
everything he tried to select details that were eminently
significant. Consequently he was of the opinion that the romance
writer should discard all that lessened this significance, that
is, extraordinary events and singular heroes. The exceptional
personage, it seemed to him, should be suppressed, as should also
high dramatic incident, since, produced by causes less general,
these have a range more restricted. The truly scientific romance
writer, proposing to paint a certain class, will attain his end
more effectively if he incarnate personages of the middle order,
and, consequently, paint traits common to that class. And not
only middle-class traits, but middle-class adventures.
From this point of view, examine the three great romances of the
Master from Rouen, and you will see that he has not lost sight of
this first and greatest principle of his art, any more than he
has of the second, which was that these documents should be drawn
up in prose of absolutely perfect technique. We know with what
passionate care he worked at his phrases, and how indefatigably
he changed them over and over again. Thus he satisfied that
instinct of beauty which was born of his romantic soul, while he
gratified the demand of truth which inhered from his scientific
training by his minute and scrupulous exactness.
The theory of the mean of truth on one side, as the foundation of
the subject,--"the humble truth," as he termed it at the
beginning of "Une Vie,"--and of the agonizing of beauty on the
other side, in composition, determines the whole use that
Maupassant made of his literary gifts. It helped to make more
intense and more systematic that dainty yet dangerous pessimism
which in him was innate. The mid- dle-class personage, in
wearisome society like ours, is always a caricature, and the
happenings are nearly always vulgar. When one studies a great
number of them, one finishes by looking at humanity from the
angle of disgust and despair. The philosophy of the romances and
novels of De Maupassant is so continuously and profoundly
surprising that one becomes overwhelmed by it. It reaches
limitation; it seems to deny that man is susceptible to grandeur,
or that motives of a superior order can uplift and ennoble the
soul, but it does so with a sorrow that is profound. All that
portion of the sentimental and moral world which in itself is the
highest remains closed to it.
In revenge, this philosophy finds itself in a relation cruelly
exact with the half-civilization of our day. By that I mean the
poorly educated individual who has rubbed against knowledge
enough to justify a certain egoism, but who is too poor in
faculty to conceive an ideal, and whose native grossness is
corrupted beyond redemption. Under his blouse, or under his
coat--whether he calls himself Renardet, as does the foul
assassin in "Petite Roque," or Duroy, as does the sly hero of
"Bel-Ami," or Bretigny, as does the vile seducer of "Mont Oriol,"
or Cesaire, the son of Old Amable in the novel of that name,
--this degraded type abounds in Maupassant's stories, evoked with
a ferocity almost jovial where it meets the robustness of
temperament which I have pointed out, a ferocity which gives them
a reality more exact still because the half-civilized person is
often impulsive and, in consequence, the physical easily
predominates. There, as elsewhere, the degenerate is everywhere a
degenerate who gives the impression of being an ordinary man.
There are quantities of men of this stamp in large cities. No
writer has felt and expressed this complex temperament with more
justice than De Maupassant, and, as he was an infinitely careful
observer of milieu and landscape and all that constitutes a
precise middle distance, his novels can be considered an
irrefutable record of the social classes which he studied at a
certain time and along certain lines. The Norman peasant and the
Provencal peasant, for example; also the small officeholder, the
gentleman of the provinces, the country squire, the clubman of
Paris, the journalist of the boulevard, the doctor at the spa,
the commercial artist, and, on the feminine side, the servant
girl, the working girl, the demigrisette, the street girl, rich
or poor, the gallant lady of the city and of the provinces, and
the society woman--these are some of the figures that he has
painted at many sittings, and whom he used to such effect that
the novels and romances in which they are painted have come to be
history. Just as it is impossible to comprehend the Rome of the
Caesars without the work of Petronius, so is it impossible to
fully comprehend the France of 1850-90 without these stories of
Maupassant. They are no more the whole image of the country than
the "Satyricon" was the whole image of Rome, but what their
author has wished to paint, he has painted to the life and with a
brush that is graphic in the extreme.
If Maupassant had only painted, in general fashion, the
characters and the phase of literature mentioned he would not be
distinguished from other writers
of the group called "naturalists." His true glory is in the
extraordinary superiority of his art. He did not invent it, and
his method is not alien to that of "Madame Bovary," but he knew
how to give it a suppleness, a variety, and a freedom which were
always wanting in Flaubert. The latter, in his best pages, is
always strained. To use the expressive metaphor of the Greek
athletes, he "smells of the oil." When one recalls that when
attacked by hysteric epilepsy, Flaubert postponed the crisis of
the terrible malady by means of sedatives, this strained
atmosphere of labor--I was going to say of stupor--which pervades
his work is explained. He is an athlete, a runner, but one who
drags at his feet a terrible weight. He is in the race only for
the prize of effort, an effort of which every motion reveals the
intensity.
Maupassant, on the other hand, if he suffered from a nervous
lesion, gave no sign of it, except in his heart. His intelligence
was bright and lively, and above all, his imagination, served by
senses always on the alert, preserved for some years an
astonishing freshness of direct vision. If his art was due to
Flaubert, it is no more belittling to him than if one call
Raphael an imitator of Perugini.
Like Flaubert, he excelled in composing a story, in distributing
the facts with subtle gradation, in bringing in at the end of a
familiar dialogue something startlingly dramatic; but such
composition, with him, seems easy, and while the descriptions are
marvelously well established in his stories, the reverse is true
of Flaubert's, which always appear a little veneered.
Maupassant's phrasing, however dramatic it may be, remains easy
and flowing.
Maupassant always sought for large and harmonious rhythm in his
deliberate choice of terms, always chose sound, wholesome
language, with a constant care for technical beauty. Inheriting
from his master an instrument already forged, he wielded it with
a surer skill. In the quality of his style, at once so firm and
clear, so gorgeous yet so sober, so supple and so firm, he equals
the writers of the seventeenth century. His method, so deeply and
simply French, succeeds in giving an indescribable "tang" to his
descriptions. If observation from nature imprints upon his tales
the strong accent of reality, the prose in which they are shrined
so conforms to the genius of the race as to smack of the soil.
It is enough that the critics of to-day place Guy de Maupassant
among our classic writers. He has his place in the ranks of pure
French genius, with the Regniers, the La Fontaines, the Molieres.
And those signs of secret ill divined everywhere under this
wholesome prose surround it for those who knew and loved him with
a pathos that is inexpressible.      {signature}
INTRODUCTION
BORN in the middle year of the nineteenth century, and fated
unfortunately never to see its close, Guy de Maupassant was
probably the most versatile and brilliant among the galaxy of
novelists who enriched French literature between the years 1800
and 1900. Poetry, drama, prose of short and sustained effort, and
volumes of travel and description, each sparkling with the same
minuteness of detail and brilliancy of style, flowed from his pen
during the twelve years of his literary life.
Although his genius asserted itself in youth, he had the patience
of the true artist, spending his early manhood in cutting and
polishing the facets of his genius under the stern though
paternal mentorship of Gustave Flaubert. Not until he had
attained the age of thirty did he venture on publication,
challenging criticism for the first time with a volume of poems.
Many and various have been the judgments passed upon Maupassant's
work. But now that the perspective of time is lengthening,
enabling us to form a more deliberate, and therefore a juster,
view of his complete achievement, we are driven irresistibly to
the conclusion that the force that shaped and swayed Maupassant's
prose writings was the conviction that in life there could be no
phase so noble or so mean, so honorable or so contemptible, so
lofty or so low as to be unworthy of chronicling,--no groove of
human virtue or fault, success or failure, wisdom or folly that
did not possess its own peculiar psychological aspect and
therefore demanded analysis.
To this analysis Maupassant brought a facile and dramatic pen, a
penetration as searching as a probe, and a power of psychological
vision that in its minute detail, now pathetic, now ironical, in
its merciless revelation of the hidden springs of the human
heart, whether of aristocrat, bourgeois, peasant, or priest,
allow one to call him a Meissonier in words.
The school of romantic realism which was founded by Merimee and
Balzac found its culmination in De Maupassant. He surpassed his
mentor, Flaubert, in the breadth and vividness of his work, and
one of the greatest of modern French critics has recorded the
deliberate opinion, that of all Taine's pupils Maupassant had the
greatest command of language and the most finished and incisive
style. Robust in imagination and fired with natural passion, his
psychological curiosity kept him true to human nature, while at
the same time his mental eye, when fixed upon the most ordinary
phases of human conduct, could see some new motive or aspect of
things hitherto unnoticed by the careless crowd.
It has been said by casual critics that Maupassant lacked one
quality indispensable to the production of truly artistic work,
viz: an absolutely normal, that is, moral, point of view. The
answer to this criticism is obvious. No dissector of the gamut of
human pas- sion and folly in all its tones could present aught
that could be called new, if ungifted with a viewpoint totally
out of the ordinary plane. Cold and merciless in the use of this
point de vue De Maupassant undoubtedly is, especially in such
vivid depictions of love, both physical and maternal, as we find
in "L'histoire d'une fille de ferme" and "La femme de Paul." But
then the surgeon's scalpel never hesitates at giving pain, and
pain is often the road to health and ease. Some of Maupassant's
short stories are sermons more forcible than any moral
dissertation could ever be.
Of De Maupassant's sustained efforts "Une Vie" may bear the palm.
This romance has the distinction of having changed Tolstoi from
an adverse critic into a warm admirer of the author. To quote the
Russian moralist upon the book:
" 'Une Vie' is a romance of the best type, and in my judgment the
greatest that has been produced by any French writer since Victor
Hugo penned 'Les Miserables.' Passing over the force and
directness of the narrative, I am struck by the intensity, the
grace, and the insight with which the writer treats the new
aspects of human nature which he finds in the life he describes."
And as if gracefully to recall a former adverse criticism,
Tolstoi adds:
"I find in the book, in almost equal strength, the three cardinal
qualities essential to great work, viz: moral purpose, perfect
style, and absolute sincerity. . . . Maupassant is a man whose
vision has penetrated the silent depths of human life, and from
that vantage- ground interprets the struggle of humanity."
"Bel-Ami" appeared almost two years after "Une Vie," that is to
say, about 1885. Discussed and criticised as it has been, it is
in reality a satire, an indignant outburst against the corruption
of society which in the story enables an ex-soldier, devoid of
conscience, honor, even of the commonest regard for others, to
gain wealth and rank. The purport of the story is clear to those
who recognize the ideas that governed Maupassant's work, and even
the hasty reader or critic, on reading "Mont Oriol," which was
published two years later and is based on a combination of the
motifs which inspired "Une Vie" and "Bel-Ami," will reconsider
former hasty judgments, and feel, too, that beneath the triumph
of evil which calls forth Maupassant's satiric anger there lies
the substratum on which all his work is founded, viz: the
persistent, ceaseless questioning of a soul unable to reconcile
or explain the contradiction between love in life and inevitable
death. Who can read in "Bel-Ami" the terribly graphic description
of the consumptive journalist's demise, his frantic clinging to
life, and his refusal to credit the slow and merciless approach
of death, without feeling that the question asked at Naishapur
many centuries ago is still waiting for the solution that is
always promised but never comes?
In the romances which followed, dating from 1888 to 1890, a sort
of calm despair seems to have settled down upon De Maupassant's
attitude toward life. Psychologically acute as ever, and as
perfect in style and sincerity as before, we miss the note of
anger. Fatality is the keynote, and yet, sounding low, we detect
a genuine subtone of sorrow. Was it a prescience of 1893? So much
work to be done, so much work demanded of him, the world of
Paris, in all its brilliant and attractive phases, at his feet,
and yet--inevitable, ever advancing death, with the question of
life still unanswered.
This may account for some of the strained situations we find in
his later romances. Vigorous in frame and hearty as he was, the
atmosphere of his mental processes must have been vitiated to
produce the dainty but dangerous pessimism that pervades some of
his later work. This was partly a consequence of his honesty and
partly of mental despair. He never accepted other people's views
on the questions of life. He looked into such problems for
himself, arriving at the truth, as it appeared to him, by the
logic of events, often finding evil where he wished to find good,
but never hoodwinking himself or his readers by adapting or
distorting the reality of things to suit a preconceived idea.
Maupassant was essentially a worshiper of the eternal feminine.
He was persuaded that without the continual presence of the
gentler sex man's existence would be an emotionally silent
wilderness. No other French writer has described and analyzed so
minutely and comprehensively the many and various motives and
moods that shape the conduct of a woman in life. Take for
instance the wonderfully subtle analysis of a woman's heart as
wife and mother that we find in "Une Vie." Could aught be more
delicately incisive? Sometimes in describing the apparently
inexplicable conduct of a certain woman he leads his readers to a
point where a false step would destroy the spell and bring the
reproach of banality and ridicule upon the tale. But the
catastrophe never occurs. It was necessary to stand poised upon
the brink of the precipice to realize the depth of the abyss and
feel the terror of the fall.
Closely allied to this phase of Maupassant's nature was the
peculiar feeling of loneliness that every now and then breaks
irresistibly forth in the course of some short story. Of kindly
soul and genial heart, he suffered not only from the oppression
of spirit caused by the lack of humanity, kindliness, sanity, and
harmony which he encountered daily in the world at large, but he
had an ever abiding sense of the invincible, unbanishable
solitariness of his own inmost self. I know of no more poignant
expression of such a feeling than the cry of despair which rings
out in the short story called "Solitude," in which he describes
the insurmountable barrier which exists between man and man, or
man and woman, however intimate the friendship between them. He
could picture but one way of destroying this terrible loneliness,
the attainment of a spiritual--a divine--state of love, a
condition to which he would give no name utterable by human lips,
lest it be profaned, but for which his whole being yearned. How
acutely he felt his failure to attain his deliverance may be
drawn from his wail that mankind has no UNIVERSAL measure of
happiness.
"Each one of us," writes De Maupassant, "forms for himself an
illusion through which he views the world, be it poetic,
sentimental, joyous, melancholy, or dismal; an illusion of
beauty, which is a human convention; of ugliness, which is a
matter of opinion; of truth, which, alas, is never immutable."
And he concludes by asserting that the happiest artist is he who
approaches most closely to the truth of things as he sees them
through his own particular illusion.
Salient points in De Maupassant's genius were that he possessed
the rare faculty of holding direct communion with his gifts, and
of writing from their dictation as it was interpreted by his
senses. He had no patience with writers who in striving to
present life as a whole purposely omit episodes that reveal the
influence of the senses. "As well," he says, "refrain from
describing the effect of intoxicating perfumes upon man as omit
the influence of beauty on the temperament of man."
De Maupassant's dramatic instinct was supremely powerful. He
seems to select unerringly the one thing in which the soul of the
scene is prisoned, and, making that his keynote, gives a picture
in words which haunt the memory like a strain of music. The
description of the ride of Madame Tellier and her companions in a
country cart through a Norman landscape is an admirable example.
You smell the masses of the colza in blossom, you see the yellow
carpets of ripe corn spotted here and there by the blue coronets
of the cornflower, and rapt by the red blaze of the poppy beds
and bathed in the fresh greenery of the landscape, you share in
the emotions felt by the happy party in the country cart. And yet
with all his vividness of description, De Maupassant is always
sober and brief. He had the genius of condensation and the
reserve which is innate in power, and to his reader could convey
as much in a paragraph as could be expressed in a page by many of
his predecessors and contemporaries, Flaubert not excepted.
Apart from his novels, De Maupassant's tales may be arranged
under three heads: Those that concern themselves with Norman
peasant life; those that deal with Government employees
(Maupassant himself had long been one) and the Paris middle
classes, and those that represent the life of the fashionable
world, as well as the weird and fantastic ideas of the later
years of his career. Of these three groups the tales of the
Norman peasantry perhaps rank highest. He depicts the Norman
farmer in surprisingly free and bold strokes, revealing him in
all his caution, astuteness, rough gaiety, and homely virtue.
The tragic stage of De Maupassant's life may, I think, be set
down as beginning just before the drama of "Musotte" was issued,
in conjunction with Jacques Normand, in 1891. He had almost given
up the hope of interpreting his puzzles, and the struggle between
the falsity of the life which surrounded him and the nobler
visions which possessed him was wearing him out. Doubtless he
resorted to unwise methods for the dispelling of physical
lassitude or for surcease from troubling mental problems. To this
period belong such weird and horrible fancies as are contained in
the short stories known as "He" and "The Diary of a Madman." Here
and there, we know, were rising in him inklings of a finer and
less sordid attitude 'twixt man and woman throughout the world
and of a purer constitution of existing things which no exterior
force should blemish or destroy. But with these yearningly
prophetic gleams came a period of mental death. Then the physical
veil was torn aside and for Guy de Maupassant the riddle of
existence was answered.           {signature}
MADEMOISELLE FIFI
The Major Graf[1] von Farlsberg, the Prussian commandant, was
reading his newspaper, lying back in a great armchair, with his
booted feet on the beautiful marble fireplace, where his spurs
had made two holes, which grew deeper every day, during the three
months that he had been in the chateau of Urville.
[1] Count.
A cup of coffee was smoking on a small inlaid table, which was
stained with liquors burnt by cigars, notched by the penknife of
the victorious officer, who occasionally would stop while
sharpening a pencil, to jot down figures, or to make a drawing on
it, just as it took his fancy.
When he had read his letters and the German newspapers, which his
baggage-master had brought him, he got up, and after throwing
three or four enormous pieces of green wood on to the fire--for
these gentlemen were gradually cutting down the park in order to
keep themselves warm--he went to the window. The rain was
descending in torrents, a regular Normandy rain, which looked as
if it were being poured out by some furious hand, a slanting
rain, which was as thick as a curtain, and which formed a kind of
wall with oblique stripes, and which deluged everything, a
regular rain, such as one frequently experiences in the
neighborhood of Rouen, which is the watering-pot of France.
For a long time the officer looked at the sodden turf, and at the
swollen Andelle beyond it, which was overflowing its banks, and
he was drumming a waltz from the Rhine on the window-panes, with
his fingers, when a noise made him turn round; it was his second
in command, Captain Baron von Kelweinstein.
The major was a giant, with broad shoulders, and a long, fair
beard, which hung like a cloth on to his chest. His whole, solemn
person suggested the idea of a military peacock, a peacock who
was carrying his tail spread out on to his breast. He had cold,
gentle, blue eyes, and the scar from a sword-cut, which he had
received in the war with Austria; he was said to be an honorable
man, as well as a brave officer.
The captain, a short, red-faced man, who was tightly girthed in
at the waist, had his red hair cropped quite close to his head,
and in certain lights almost looked as if he had been rubbed over
with phosphorus. He had lost two front teeth one night, though he
could not quite remember how. This defect made him speak so that
he could not always be understood, and he had a bald patch on the
top of his head, which made him look rather like a monk, with a
fringe of curly, bright, golden hair round the circle of bare
skin.
The commandant shook hands with him, and drank his cup of coffee
(the sixth that morning) at a draught, while he listened to his
subordinate's report of what had occurred; and then they both
went to the window, and declared that it was a very unpleasant
outlook. The major, who was a quiet man, with a wife at home,
could accommodate himself to everything; but the captain, who was
rather fast, being in the habit of frequenting low resorts, and
much given to women, was mad at having been shut up for three
months in the compulsory chastity of that wretched hole.
There was a knock at the door, and when the commandant said,
"Come in," one of their automatic soldiers appeared, and by his
mere presence announced that breakfast was ready. In the dining-
room, they met three other officers of lower rank: a lieutenant,
Otto von Grossling, and two sub-lieutenants, Fritz Scheunebarg,
and Count von Eyrick a very short, fair-haired man, who was proud
and brutal toward men, harsh toward prisoners, and very violent.
Since he had been in France, his comrades had called him nothing
but "Mademoiselle Fifi." They had given him that nickname on
account of his dandified style and small waist, which looked as
if he wore stays, from his pale face, on which his budding
mustache scarcely showed, and on account of the habit he had
acquired of employing the French expression, fi, fi donc, which
he pronounced with a slight whistle, when he wished to express
his sovereign contempt for persons or things.
The dining-room of the chateau was a magnificent long room, whose
fine old mirrors, now cracked by pistol bullets, and Flemish
tapestry, now cut to ribbons and hanging in rags in places, from
sword-cuts, told too well what Mademoiselle Fifi's occupation was
during his spare time.
There were three family portraits on the walls; a steel-clad
knight, a cardinal, and a judge, who were all smoking long
porcelain pipes, which had been inserted into holes in the
canvas, while a lady in a long, pointed waist proudly exhibited
an enormous pair of mustaches, drawn with a piece of charcoal.
The officers ate their breakfast almost in silence in that
mutilated room, which looked dull in the rain, and melancholy
under its vanquished appearance, although its old, oak floor had
become as solid as the stone floor of a public-house.
When they had finished eating, and were smoking and drinking,
they began, as usual, to talk about the dull life they were
leading. The bottles of brandy and of liquors passed from hand to
hand, and all sat back in their chairs, taking repeated sips from
their glasses, and scarcely removing the long, bent stems, which
terminated in china bowls painted in a manner to delight a
Hottentot, from their mouths.
As soon as their glasses were empty, they filled them again, with
a gesture of resigned weariness, but Mademoiselle Fifi emptied
his every minute, and a soldier immediately gave him another.
They were enveloped in a cloud of strong tobacco smoke; they
seemed to be sunk in a state of drowsy, stupid intoxication, in
that dull state of drunkenness of men who have nothing to do,
when suddenly, the baron sat up, and said: "By heavens! This
cannot go on; we must think of something to do." And on hearing
this, Lieutenant Otto and Sub-lieutenant Fritz, who pre-eminently
possessed the grave, heavy German countenance, said: "What,
Captain?"
He thought for a few moments, and then replied "What? Well, we
must get up some entertainment; if the commandant will allow us."
"What sort of an entertainment, captain?" the major asked, taking
his pipe out of his mouth.
"I will arrange all that, commandant," the baron said. "I will
send Le Devoir to Rouen, who will bring us some ladies. I know
where they can be found. We will have supper here, as all the
materials are at hand, and, at least, we shall have a jolly
evening."
Graf von Farlsberg shrugged his shoulders with a smile: "You must
surely be mad, my friend."
But all the other officers got up, surrounded their chief, and
said: "Let the captain have his own way, commandant; it is
terribly dull here."
And the major ended by yielding. "Very well," he replied, and the
baron immediately sent for Le Devoir.
The latter was an old corporal who had never been seen to smile,
but who carried out all the orders of his superiors to the
letter, no matter what they might be. He stood there, with an
impassive face while he received the baron's instructions, and
then went out; five minutes later a large wagon belonging to the
military train, covered with a miller's tilt, galloped off as
fast as four horses could take it, under the pouring rain, and
the officers all seemed to awaken from their lethargy, their
looks brightened, and they began to talk.
Although it was raining as hard as ever, the major declared that
it was not so dull, and Lieutenant von Grossling said with
conviction, that the sky was clearing up, while Mademoiselle Fifi
did not seem to be able to keep in his place. He got up, and sat
down again, and his bright eyes seemed to be looking for
something to destroy. Suddenly, looking at the lady with the
mustaches, the young fellow pulled out his revolver, and said:
"You shall not see it." And without leaving his seat he aimed,
and with two successive bullets cut out both the eyes of the
portrait.
"Let us make a mine!" he then exclaimed, and the conversation was
suddenly interrupted, as if they had found some fresh and
powerful subject of interest. The mine was his invention, his
method of destruction, and his favorite amusement.
When he left the chateau, the lawful owner, Count Fernand d'Amoys
d'Urville, had not had time to carry away or to hide anything,
except the plate, which had been stowed away in a hole made in
one of the walls, so that, as he was very rich and had good
taste, the large drawing-room, which opened into the dining-room,
had looked like the gallery in a museum, before his precipitate
flight.
Expensive oil-paintings, water-colors, and drawings hung upon the
walls, while on the tables, on the hanging shelves, and in
elegant glass cupboards, there were a thousand knickknacks: small
vases, statuettes, groups in Dresden china, grotesque Chinese
figures, old ivory, and Venetian glass, which filled the large
room with their precious and fantastical array.
Scarcely anything was left now; not that the things had been
stolen, for the major would not have allowed that, but
Mademoiselle Fifi WOULD HAVE A MINE, and on that occasion all the
officers thoroughly enjoyed themselves for five minutes. The
little marquis went into the drawing-room to get what he wanted,
and he brought back a small, delicate china teapot, which he
filled with gunpowder, and carefully introduced a piece of German
tinder into it, through the spout. Then he lighted it, and took
this infernal machine into the next room; but he came back
immediately and shut the door. The Germans all stood expectantly,
their faces full of childish, smiling curiosity, and as soon as
the explosion had shaken the chateau, they all rushed in at once.
Mademoiselle Fifi, who got in first, clapped his hands in delight
at the sight of a terra-cotta Venus, whose head had been blown
off, and each picked up pieces of porcelain, and wondered at the
strange shape of the fragments, while the major was looking with
a paternal eye at the large drawing-room which had been wrecked
in such a Neronic fashion, and which was strewn with the
fragments of works of art. He went out first, and said, with a
smile: "He managed that very well!"
But there was such a cloud of smoke in the dining-room, mingled
with the tobacco smoke, that they could not breathe, so the
commandant opened the window, and all the officers, who had gone
into the room for a glass of cognac, went up to it.
The moist air blew into the room, and brought a sort of spray
with it, which powdered their beards. They looked at the tall
trees which were dripping with the rain, at the broad valley
which was covered with mist, and at the church spire in the
distance, which rose up like a gray point in the beating rain.
The bells had not rung since their arrival. That was the only
resistance which the invaders had met with in the neighborhood.
The parish priest had not refused to take in and to feed the
Prussian soldiers; he had several times even drunk a bottle of
beer or claret with the hostile commandant, who often employed
him as a benevolent intermediary; but it was no use to ask him
for a single stroke of the bells; he would sooner have allowed
himself to be shot. That was his way of protesting against the
invasion, a peaceful and silent protest, the only one, he said,
which was suitable to a priest, who was a man of mildness, and
not of blood; and everyone, for twenty-five miles round, praised
Abbe Chantavoine's firmness and heroism, in venturing to proclaim
the public mourning by the obstinate silence of his church bells.
The whole village grew enthusiastic over his resistance, and was
ready to back up their pastor and to risk anything, as they
looked upon that silent protest as the safeguard of the national
honor. It seemed to the peasants that thus they had deserved
better of their country than Belfort and Strassburg, that they
had set an equally valuable example, and that the name of their
little village would become immortalized by that; but with that
exception, they refused their Prussian conquerors nothing.
The commandant and his officers laughed among themselves at that
inoffensive courage, and as the people in the whole country round
showed themselves obliging and compliant toward them, they
willingly tolerated their silent patriotism. Only little Count
Wilhelm would have liked to have forced them to ring the bells.
He was very angry at his superior's politic compliance with the
priest's scruples, and every day he begged the commandant to
allow him to sound "ding-dong, ding-dong," just once, only just
once, just by way of a joke. And he asked it like a wheedling
woman, in the tender voice of some mistress who wishes to obtain
something, but the commandant would not yield, and to console
HERSELF, Mademoiselle Fifi made A MINE in the chateau.
The five men stood there together for some minutes, inhaling the
moist air, and at last, Lieutenant Fritz said, with a laugh: "The
ladies will certainly not have fine weather for their drive."
Then they separated, each to his own duties, while the captain
had plenty to do in seeing about the dinner.
When they met again, as it was growing dark, they began to laugh
at seeing each other as dandified and smart as on the day of a
grand review. The commandant's hair did not look as gray as it
did in the morning, and the captain had shaved--had only kept his
mustache on, which made him look as if he had a streak of fire
under his nose.
In spite of the rain, they left the window open, and one of them
went to listen from time to time. At a quarter past six the baron
said he heard a rumbling in the distance. They all rushed down,
and soon the wagon drove up at a gallop with its four horses,
splashed up to their backs, steaming and panting. Five women got
out at the bottom of the steps, five handsome girls whom a
comrade of the captain, to whom Le Dervoir had taken his card,
had selected with care.
They had not required much pressing, as they were sure of being
well treated, for they had got to know the Prussians in the three
months during which they had had to do with them. So they
resigned themselves to the men as they did to the state of
affairs. "It is part of our business, so it must be done," they
said as they drove along; no doubt to allay some slight, secret
scruples of conscience.
They went into the dining-room immediately, which looked still
more dismal in its dilapidated state, when it was lighted up;
while the table covered with choice dishes, the beautiful china
and glass, and the plate, which had been found in the hole in the
wall where its owner had hidden it, gave to the place the look of
a bandits' resort, where they were supping after committing a
robbery. The captain was radiant; he took hold of the women as if
he were familiar with them; appraising them, kissing them,
valuing them for what they were worth as LADIES OF PLEASURE; and
when the three young men wanted to appropriate one each, he
opposed them authoritatively, reserving to himself the right to
apportion them justly, according to their several ranks, so as
not to wound the hierarchy. Therefore, so as to avoid all
discussion, jarring, and suspicion of partiality, he placed them
all in a line according to height, and addressing the tallest, he
said in a voice of command:
"What is your name?"
"Pamela," she replied, raising her voice.
Then he said: "Number One, called Pamela, is adjudged to the
commandant."
Then, having kissed Blondina, the second, as a sign of
proprietorship, he proffered stout Amanda to Lieutenant Otto!
Eva, "the Tomato," to Sub-lieutenant Fritz, and Rachel, the
shortest of them all, a very young, dark girl, with eyes as black
as ink, a Jewess, whose snub nose confirmed by exception the rule
which allots hooked noses to all her race, to the youngest
officer, frail Count Wilhelm von Eyrick.
They were all pretty and plump, without any distinctive features,
and all were very much alike in look and person, from their daily
dissipation, and the life common to houses of public
accommodation.
The three younger men wished to carry off their women
immediately, under the pretext of finding them brushes and soap;
but the captain wisely opposed this, for he said they were quite
fit to sit down to dinner, and that those who went up would wish
for a change when they came down, and so would disturb the other
couples, and his experience in such matters carried the day.
There were only many kisses; expectant kisses.
Suddenly Rachel choked, and began to cough until the tears came
into her eyes, while smoke came through her nostrils. Under
pretense of kissing her, the count had blown a whiff of tobacco
into her mouth. She did not fly into a rage, and did not say a
word, but she looked at her possessor with latent hatred in her
dark eyes.
They sat down to dinner. The commandant seemed delighted; he made
Pamela sit on his right, and Blondina on his left, and said, as
he unfolded his table napkin: "That was a delightful idea of
yours, captain."
Lieutenants Otto and Fritz, who were as polite as if they had
been with fashionable ladies, rather intimidated their neighbors,
but Baron von Kelweinstein gave the reins to all his vicious
propensities, beamed, made doubtful remarks, and seemed on fire
with his crown of red hair. He paid them compliments in French
from the other side of the Rhine, and sputtered out gallant
remarks, only fit for a low pot-house, from between his two
broken teeth.
They did not understand him, however, and their intelligence did
not seem to be awakened until he uttered nasty words and broad
expressions, which were mangled by his accent. Then all began to
laugh at once, like mad women, and fell against each other,
repeating the words, which the baron then began to say all wrong,
in order that he might have the pleasure of hearing them say
doubtful things. They gave him as much of that stuff as he
wanted, for they were drunk after the first bottle of wine, and,
becoming themselves once more, and opening the door to their
usual habits, they kissed the mustaches on the right and left of
them, pinched their arms, uttered furious cries, drank out of
every glass, and sang French couplets, and bits of German songs,
which they had picked up in their daily intercourse with the
enemy.
Soon the men themselves, intoxicated by that which was displayed
to their sight and touch, grew very amorous, shouted and broke
the plates and dishes, while the soldiers behind them waited on
them stolidly. The commandant was the only one who put any
restraint upon himself.
Mademoiselle Fifi had taken Rachel on to his knees, and, getting
excited, at one moment kissed the little black curls on her neck,
inhaling the pleasant warmth of her body, and all the savor of
her person, through the slight space there was between her dress
and her skin, and at another pinched her furiously through the
material, and made her scream, for he was seized with a species
of ferocity, and tormented by his desire to hurt her. He often
held her close to him, as if to make her part of himself, and put
his lips in a long kiss on the Jewess's rosy mouth, until she
lost her breath; and at last he bit her until a stream of blood
ran down her chin and on to her bodice.
For the second time, she looked him full in the face, and as she
bathed the wound, she said: "You will have to pay for that!"
But he merely laughed a hard laugh, and said: "I will pay."
At dessert, champagne was served, and the commandant rose, and in
the same voice in which he would have drunk to the health of the
Empress Augusta, he drank: "To our ladies!" Then a series of
toasts began, toasts worthy of the lowest soldiers and of
drunkards, mingled with filthy jokes, which were made still more
brutal by their ignorance of the language. They got up, one after
the other, trying to say something witty, forcing themselves to
be funny, and the women, who were so drunk that they almost fell
off their chairs, with vacant looks and clammy tongues, applauded
madly each time.
The captain, who no doubt wished to impart an appearance of
gallantry to the orgy, raised his glass again, and said: "To our
victories over hearts!" Thereupon Lieutenant Otto, who was a
species of bear from the Black Forest, jumped up, inflamed and
saturated with drink, and seized by an access of alcoholic
patriotism, cried: "To our victories over France!"
Drunk as they were, the women were silent, and Rachel turned
round with a shudder, and said: "Look here, I know some
Frenchmen, in whose presence you would not dare to say that." But
the little count, still holding her on his knees, began to laugh,
for the wine had made him very merry, and said: "Ha! ha! ha! I
have never met any of them, myself. As soon as we show ourselves,
they run away!"
The girl, who was in a terrible rage, shouted into his face: "You
are lying, you dirty scoundrel!"
For a moment, he looked at her steadily, with his bright eyes
upon her, as he had looked at the portrait before he destroyed it
with revolver bullets, and then he began to laugh: "Ah! yes, talk
about them, my dear! Should we be here now, if they were brave?"
Then getting excited, he exclaimed: "We are the masters! France
belongs to us!" She jumped off his knees with a bound, and threw
herself into her chair, while he rose, held out his glass over
the table, and repeated: "France and the French, the woods, the
fields, and the houses of France belong to us!"
The others, who were quite drunk, and who were suddenly seized by
military enthusiasm, the enthusiasm of brutes, seized their
glasses, and shouting, "Long live Prussia!" emptied them at a
draught.
The girls did not protest, for they were reduced to silence, and
were afraid. Even Rachel did not say a word, as she had no reply
to make, and then the little count put his champagne glass, which
had just been refilled, on to the head of the Jewess, and
exclaimed: "All the women in France belong to us, also!"
At that she got up so quickly that the glass upset, spilling the
amber colored wine on to her black hair as if to baptize her, and
broke into a hundred fragments as it fell on to the floor. With
trembling lips, she defied the looks of the officer, who was
still laughing, and she stammered out, in a voice choked with
rage: "That--that--that--is not true,--for you shall certainly
not have any French women."
He sat down again, so as to laugh at his ease, and trying
ineffectually to speak in the Parisian accent, he said: "That is
good, very good! Then what did you come here for, my dear?"
She was thunderstruck, and made no reply for a moment, for in her
agitation she did not understand him at first; but as soon as she
grasped his meaning, she said to him indignantly and vehemently:
"I! I! I am not a woman; I am only a strumpet, and that is all
that Prussians want."
Almost before she had finished, he slapped her full in her face;
but as he was raising his hand again as if he would strike her,
she, almost mad with passion, took up a small dessert knife from
the table, and stabbed him right in the neck, just above the
breastbone. Something that he was going to say, was cut short in
his throat, and he sat there, with his mouth half open, and a
terrible look in his eyes.
All the officers shouted in horror, and leaped up tumultuously;
but throwing her chair between Lieutenant Otto's legs, who fell
down at full length, she ran to the window, opened it before they
could seize her, and jumped out into the night and pouring rain.
In two minutes, Mademoiselle Fifi was dead. Fritz and Otto drew
their swords and wanted to kill the women, who threw themselves
at their feet and clung to their knees. With some difficulty the
major stopped the slaughter, and had the four terrified girls
locked up in a room under the care of two soldiers. Then he
organized the pursuit of the fugitive, as carefully as if he were
about to engage in a skirmish, feeling quite sure that she would
be caught.
The table, which had been cleared immediately, now served as a
bed on which to lay Fifi out, and the four officers made for the
window, rigid and sobered, with the stern faces of soldiers on
duty, and tried to pierce through the darkness of the night, amid
the steady torrent of rain. Suddenly, a shot was heard, and then
another, a long way off; and for four hours they heard, from time
to time, near or distant reports and rallying cries, strange
words uttered as a call, in guttural voices.
In the morning they all returned. Two soldiers had been killed
and three others wounded by their comrades in the ardor of that
chase, and in the confusion of such a nocturnal pursuit, but they
had not caught Rachel.
Then the inhabitants of the district were terrorized, the houses
were turned topsy-turvy, the country was scoured and beaten up,
over and over again, but the Jewess did not seem to have left a
single trace of her passage behind her.
When the general was told of it, he gave orders to hush up the
affair, so as not to set a bad example to the army, but he
severely censured the commandant, who in turn punished his
inferiors. The general had said: "One does not go to war in order
to amuse oneself, and to caress prostitutes." And Graf von
Farlsberg, in his exasperation, made up his mind to have his
revenge on the district, but as he required a pretext for showing
severity, he sent for the priest and ordered him to have the bell
tolled at the funeral of Count von Eyrick.
Contrary to all expectation, the priest showed himself humble and
most respectful, and when Mademoiselle Fifi's body left the
Chateau d'Urville on its way to the cemetery, carried by
soldiers, preceded, surrounded, and followed by soldiers, who
marched with loaded rifles, for the first time the bell sounded
its funereal knell in a lively manner, as if a friendly hand were
caressing it. At night it sounded again, and the next day, and
every day; it rang as much as anyone could desire. Sometimes
even, it would start at night, and sound gently through the
darkness, seized by strange joy, awakened, one could not tell
why. All the peasants in the neighborhood declared that it was
bewitched, and nobody, except the priest and the sacristan would
now go near the church tower, and they went because a poor girl
was living there in grief and solitude, secretly nourished by
those two men.
She remained there until the German troops departed, and then one
evening the priest borrowed the baker's cart, and himself drove
his prisoner to Rouen. When they got there, he embraced her, and
she quickly went back on foot to the establishment from which she
had come, where the proprietress, who thought that she was dead,
was very glad to see her.
A short time afterward, a patriot who had no prejudices, who
liked her because of her bold deed, and who afterward loved her
for herself, married her, and made a lady of her.
AN AFFAIR OF STATE.
Paris had just heard of the disaster of Sedan. The Republic was
proclaimed. All France was panting from a madness that lasted
until the time of the Commonwealth. Everybody was playing at
soldier from one end of the country to the other.
Capmakers became colonels, assuming the duties of generals;
revolvers and daggers were displayed on large rotund bodies,
enveloped in red sashes; common citizens turned warriors,
commanding battalions of noisy volunteers, and swearing like
troopers to emphasize their importance.
The very fact of bearing arms and handling guns with a system
excited a people who hitherto had only handled scales and
measures, and made them formidable to the first comer, without
reason. They even executed a few innocent people to prove that
they knew how to kill; and, in roaming through virgin fields
still belonging to the Prussians, they shot stray dogs, cows
chewing the cud in peace, or sick horses put out to pasture. Each
believed himself called upon to play a great role in military
affairs. The cafes of the smallest villages, full of tradesmen in
uniform, resembled barracks or field hospitals.
Now, the town of Canneville did not yet know the exciting news of
the army and the Capital. It had, however, been greatly agitated
for a month over an encounter between the rival political
parties. The mayor, Viscount de Varnetot, a small, thin man,
already old, remained true to the Empire, especially since he saw
rising up against him a powerful adversary, in the great,
sanguine form of Doctor Massarel, head of the Republican party in
the district, venerable chief of the Masonic lodge, president of
the Society of Agriculture and of the Fire Department, and
organizer of the rural militia designed to save the country.
In two weeks he had induced sixty-three men to volunteer in
defense of their country--married men, fathers of families,
prudent farmers and merchants of the town. These he drilled every
morning in front of the mayor's window.
Whenever the mayor happened to appear, Commander Massarel,
covered with pistols, passing proudly up and down in front of his
troops, would make them shout, "Long live our country!" And this,
they noticed, disturbed the little viscount, who no doubt heard
in it menace and defiance, and perhaps some odious recollection
of the great Revolution.
On the morning of the fifth of September, in uniform, his
revolver on the table, the doctor gave consultation to an old
peasant couple. The husband had suffered with a varicose vein for
seven years, but had waited until his wife had one too, so that
they might go and hunt up a physician together, guided by the
postman when he should come with the newspaper.
Dr. Massarel opened the door, grew pale, straightened himself
abruptly and, raising his arms to heaven in a gesture of
exaltation, cried out with all his might, in the face of the
amazed rustics:
"Long live the Republic! Long live the Republic! Long live the
Republic!"
Then he dropped into his armchair weak with emotion.
When the peasant explained that this sickness commenced with a
feeling as if ants were running up and down in his legs, the
doctor exclaimed: "Hold your peace. I have spent too much time
with you stupid people. The Republic is proclaimed! The Emperor
is a prisoner! France is saved! Long live the Republic!" And,
running to the door, he bellowed: "Celeste! Quick! Celeste!"
The frightened maid hastened in. He stuttered, so rapidly did he
try to speak: "My boots, my saber --my cartridge box--and--the
Spanish dagger, which is on my night table. Hurry now!"
The obstinate peasant, taking advantage of the moment's silence,
began again: "This seemed like some cysts that hurt me when I
walked."
The exasperated physician shouted: "Hold your peace! For Heaven's
sake! If you had washed your feet oftener, it would not have
happened." Then, seizing him by the neck, he hissed in his face:
"Can you not comprehend that we are living in a Republic,
stupid?"
But professional sentiment calmed him suddenly, and he let the
astonished old couple out of the house, repeating all the time:
"Return to-morrow, return to-morrow, my friends; I have no more
time to-day."
While equipping himself from head to foot, he gave another series
of urgent orders to the maid:
"Run to Lieutenant Picard's and to Sub-lieutenant Pommel's and
say to them that I want them here immediately. Send Torcheboeuf
to me, too, with his drum. Quick, now! Quick!" And when Celeste
was gone, he collected his thoughts and prepared to surmount the
difficulties of the situation.
The three men arrived together. They were in their working
clothes. The Commander, who had expected to see them in uniform,
had a fit of surprise.
"You know nothing, then? The Emperor has been taken prisoner. A
Republic is proclaimed. My position is delicate, not to say
perilous."
He reflected for some minutes before the astonished faces of his
subordinates and then continued:
"It is necessary to act, not to hesitate. Minutes now are worth
hours at other times. Everything depends upon promptness of
decision. You, Picard, go and find the curate and get him to ring
the bell to bring the people together, while I get ahead of them.
You, Torcheboeuf, beat the call to assemble the militia in arms,
in the square, from even as far as the hamlets of Gerisaie and
Salmare. You, Pommell put on your uniform at once, that is, the
jacket and cap. We, together, are going to take possession of the
mairie and summon M. de Varnetot to transfer his authority to me.
Do you understand?"
"Yes."
"Act, then, and promptly. I will accompany you to your house,
Pommel, since we are to work together."
Five minutes later, the Commander and his subaltern, armed to the
teeth, appeared in the square, just at the moment when the little
Viscount de Varnetot, with hunting gaiters on and his rifle on
his shoulder, appeared by another street, walking rapidly and
followed by three guards in green jackets, each carrying a knife
at his side and a gun over his shoulder.
While the doctor stopped, half stupefied, the four men entered
the mayor's house and the door closed behind them.
"We are forestalled," murmured the doctor; "it will be necessary
now to wait for re-enforcements; nothing can be done for a
quarter of an hour."
Here Lieutenant Picard appeared: "The curate refuses to obey,"
said he; "he has even shut himself up in the church with the
beadle and the porter."
On the other side of the square, opposite the white, closed front
of the mairie, the church, mute and black, showed its great oak
door with the wrought-iron trimmings.
Then, as the puzzled inhabitants put their noses out of the
windows, or came out upon the steps of their houses, the rolling
of a drum was heard, and Torcheboeuf suddenly appeared, beating
with fury the three quick strokes of the call to arms. He crossed
the square with disciplined step, and then disappeared on a road
leading to the country.
The Commander drew his sword, advanced alone to the middle
distance between the two buildings where the enemy was barricaded
and, waving his weapon above his head, roared at the top of his
lungs: "Long live the Republic! Death to traitors!" Then he fell
back where his officers were. The butcher, the baker, and the
apothecary, feeling a little uncertain, put up their shutters and
closed their shops. The grocery alone remained open.
Meanwhile the men of the militia were arriving, little by little,
variously clothed, but all wearing caps, the cap constituting the
whole uniform of the corps. They were armed with their old, rusty
guns, guns that had hung on chimney-pieces in kitchens for thirty
years, and looked quite like a detachment of country soldiers.
When there were about thirty around him, the Commander explained
in a few words, the state of affairs. Then, turning toward his
major, he said: "Now, we must act."
While the inhabitants collected, talked over and discussed the
matter, the doctor quickly formed his plan of campaign:
"Lieutenant Picard, you advance to the windows of the mayor's
house and order M. de Varnetot to turn over the townhall to me,
in the name of the Republic."
But the lieutenant was a master-mason and refused.
"You are a scamp, you are. Trying to make a target of me! Those
fellows in there are good shots, you know that. No, thanks!
Execute your commissions yourself!"
The Commander turned red: "I order you to go in the name of
discipline," said he.
"I am not spoiling my features without knowing why," the
lieutenant returned.
Men of influence, in a group near by, were heard laughing. One of
them called out: "You are right, Picard, it is not the proper
time." The doctor, under his breath, muttered: "Cowards!" And,
placing his sword and his revolver in the hands of a soldier, he
advanced with measured step, his eye fixed on the windows, as if
he expected to see a gun or a cannon pointed at him.
When he was within a few steps of the building the doors at the
two extremities, affording an entrance to two schools, opened,
and a flood of little creatures, boys on one side, girls on the
other, poured out and began playing in the open space, chattering
around the doctor like a flock of birds. He scarcely knew what to
make of it.
As soon as the last were out, the doors closed. The greater part
of the little monkeys finally scattered and then the Commander
called out in a loud voice
"Monsieur de Varnetot?" A window in the first story opened and M.
de Varnetot appeared.
The Commander began: "Monsieur, you are aware of the great events
which have changed the system of Government. The party you
represent no longer exists. The side I represent now comes into
power. Under these sad, but decisive circumstances, I come to
demand you, in the name of the Republic, to put in my hand the
authority vested in you by the outgoing power."
M. de Varnetot replied: "Doctor Massarel, I am mayor of
Canneville, so placed by the proper authorities, and mayor of
Canneville I shall remain until the title is revoked and replaced
by an order from my superiors. As mayor, I am at home in the
mairie, and there I shall stay. Furthermore, just try to put me
out." And he closed the window.
The Commander returned to his troops. But, before explaining
anything, measuring Lieutenant Picard from head to foot, he said:
"You are a numskull, you are,--a goose, the disgrace of the army.
I shall degrade you."
The Lieutenant replied: "I'll attend to that myself." And he went
over to a group of muttering civilians.
Then the doctor hesitated. What should he do? Make an assault?
Would his men obey him? And then, was he surely in the right? An
idea burst upon him. He ran to the telegraph office, on the other
side of the square, and hurriedly sent three dispatches: "To the
Members of the Republican Government, at Paris"; "To the New
Republican Prefect of the Lower Seine, at Rouen"; "To the New
Republican Sub-Prefect of Dieppe."
He exposed the situation fully; told of the danger run by the
commonwealth from remaining in the hands of the monarchistic
mayor, offered his devout services, asked for orders and signed
his name, following it up with all his titles. Then he returned
to his army corps and, drawing ten francs out of his pocket,
said:
"Now, my friends, go and eat and drink a little something. Only
leave here a detachment of ten men, so that no one leaves the
mayor's house."
Ex-Lieutenant Picard chatting with the watch-maker, overheard
this. With a sneer he remarked:
"Pardon me, but if they go out, there will be an opportunity for
you to go in. Otherwise, I can't see how you are to get in
there!"
The doctor made no reply, but went away to luncheon. In the
afternoon, he disposed of offices all about town, having the air
of knowing of an impending surprise. Many times he passed before
the doors of the mairie and of the church, without noticing
anything suspicious; one could have believed the two buildings
empty.
The butcher, the baker, and the apothecary re-opened their shops,
and stood gossiping on the steps. If the Emperor had been taken
prisoner, there must be a traitor somewhere. They did not feel
sure of the revenue of a new Republic.
Night came on. Toward nine o'clock, the doctor returned quietly
and alone to the mayor's residence, persuaded that his adversary
had retired. And, as he was trying to force an entrance with a
few blows of a pickaxe, the loud voice of a guard demanded
suddenly: "Who goes there?" Monsieur Massarel beat a retreat at
the top of his speed.
Another day dawned without any change in the situation. The
militia in arms occupied the square. The inhabitants stood around
awaiting the solution. People from neighboring villages came to
look on. Finally, the doctor, realizing that his reputation was
at stake, resolved to settle the thing in one way or another. He
had just decided that it must be something energetic, when the
door of the telegraph office opened and the little servant of the
directress appeared, holding in her hand two papers.
She went directly to the Commander and gave him one of the
dispatches; then, crossing the square, intimidated by so many
eyes fixed upon her, with lowered head and mincing steps, she
rapped gently at the door of the barricaded house, as if ignorant
that a part of the army was concealed there.
The door opened slightly; the hand of a man received the message,
and the girl returned, blushing and ready to weep, from being
stared at.
The doctor demanded, with stirring voice: "A little silence, if
you please." And, after the populace became quiet, he continued
proudly:
"Here is a communication which I have received from the
Government." And raising the dispatch, he read:
"Old mayor deposed. Advise us of what is most necessary,
Instructions later.
"For the Sub-Prefect,
"SAPIN, Counselor."
He had triumphed. His heart was beating with joy. His hand
trembled, when Picard, his old subaltern, cried out to him from a
neighboring group: "That's all right; but if the others in there
won't go out, your paper hasn't a leg to stand on." The doctor
grew a little pale. If they would not go out --in fact, he must
go ahead now. It was not only his right, but his duty. And he
looked anxiously at the house of the mayoralty, hoping that he
might see the door open and his adversary show himself. But the
door remained closed. What was to be done? The crowd was
increasing, surrounding the militia. Some laughed.
One thought, especially, tortured the doctor. If he should make
an assault, he must march at the head of his men; and as, with
him dead, all contest would cease, it would be at him, and at him
alone that M. de Varnetot and the three guards would aim. And
their aim was good, very good! Picard had reminded him of that.
But an idea shone in upon him, and turning to Pommel, he said:
"Go, quickly, and ask the apothecary to send me a napkin and a
pole."
The Lieutenant hurried off. The doctor was going to make a
political banner, a white one, that would perhaps, rejoice the
heart of that old legitimist, the mayor.
Pommel returned with the required linen and a broom handle. With
some pieces of string, they improvised a standard, which Massarel
seized in both hands. Again, he advanced toward the house of
mayoralty, bearing the standard before him. When in front of the
door, he called out: "Monsieur de Varnetot!"
The door opened suddenly, and M. de Varnetot and the three guards
appeared on the threshold. The doctor recoiled, instinctively.
Then, he saluted his enemy courteously, and announced, almost
strangled by emotion: "I have come, sir, to communicate to you
the instructions I have just received."
That gentleman, without any salutation whatever, replied: "I am
going to withdraw, sir, but you must understand that it is not
because of fear, or in obedience to an odious government that has
usurped the power." And, biting off each word, he declared: "I do
not wish to have the appearance of serving the Republic for a
single day. That is all."
Massarel, amazed, made no reply; and M, de Varnetot, walking off
at a rapid pace, disappeared around the corner, followed closely
by his escort. Then the doctors slightly dismayed, returned to
the crowd. When he was near enough to be heard, he cried:
"Hurrah! Hurrah! The Republic triumphs all along the line!"
But no emotion was manifested. The doctor tried again. "The
people are free! You are free and independent! Do you understand?
Be proud of it!"
The listless villagers looked at him with eyes unlit by glory. In
his turn, he looked at them, indignant at their indifference,
seeking for some word that could make a grand impression,
electrify this placid country and make good his mission. The
inspiration come, and turning to Pommel, he said: "Lieutenant, go
and get the bust of the ex-Emperor, which is in the Council Hall,
and bring it to me with a chair."
And soon the man reappears, carrying on his right shoulder,
Napoleon III. in plaster, and holding in his left hand a
straw-bottomed chair.
Massarel met him, took the chair, placed it on the ground, put
the white image upon it, fell back a few steps and called out, in
sonorous voice:
"Tyrant! Tyrant! Here do you fall! Fall in the dust and in the
mire. An expiring country groans under your feet. Destiny has
called you the Avenger. Defeat and shame cling to you. You fall
conquered, a prisoner to the Prussians, and upon the ruins of the
crumbling Empire the young and radiant Republic arises, picking
up your broken sword."
He awaited applause. But there was no voice, no sound. The
bewildered peasants remained silent. And the bust, with its
pointed mustaches extending beyond the cheeks on each side, the
bust, so motionless and well groomed as to be fit for a
hairdressers sign, seemed to be looking at M. Massarel with a
plaster smile, a smile ineffaceable and mocking.
They remained thus face to face, Napoleon on the chair, the
doctor in front of him about three steps away. Suddenly the
Commander grew angry. What was to be done? What was there that
would move this people, and bring about a definite victory in
opinion? His hand happened to rest on his hip and to come in
contact there with the butt end of his revolver, under his red
sash. No inspiration, no further word would come. But he drew his
pistol, advanced two steps, and, taking aim, fired at the late
monarch. The ball entered the forehead, leaving a little, black
hole, like a spot, nothing more. There was no effect. Then he
fired a second shot, which made a second hole, then, a third; and
then, without stopping, he emptied his revolver. The brow of
Napoleon disappeared in white powder, but the eyes, the nose, and
the fine points of the mustaches remained intact. Then,
exasperated, the doctor overturned the chair with a blow of his
fist and, resting a foot on the remainder of the bust in a
position of triumph, he shouted: "So let all tyrants perish!"
Still no enthusiasm was manifest, and as the spectators seemed to
be in a kind of stupor from astonishment, the Commander called to
the militiamen: "You may now go to your homes." And he went
toward his own house with great strides, as if he were pursued.
His maid, when he appeared, told him that some patients had been
waiting in his office for three hours. He hastened in. There were
the two varicose-vein patients, who had returned at daybreak,
obstinate but patient.
The old man immediately began his explanation: "This began by a
feeling like ants running up and down the legs."
THE ARTIST
"Bah! Monsieur," the old mountebank said to me; "it is a matter
of exercise and habit, that is all! Of course, one requires to be
a little gifted that way and not to be butter-fingered, but what
is chiefly necessary is patience and daily practice for long,
long years."
His modesty surprised me all the more, because of all performers
who are generally infatuated with their own skill, he was the
most wonderfully clever one I had met. Certainly I had frequently
seen him, for everybody had seen him in some circus or other, or
even in traveling shows, performing the trick that consists of
putting a man or woman with extended arms against a wooden
target, and in throwing knives between their fingers and round
their heads, from a distance. There is nothing very extraordinary
in it, after all, when one knows THE TRICKS OF THE TRADE, and
that the knives are not the least sharp, and stick into the wood
at some distance from the flesh. It is the rapidity of the
throws, the glitter of the blades, and the curve which the
handles make toward their living object, which give an air of
danger to an exhibition that has become commonplace, and only
requires very middling skill.
But here there was no trick and no deception, and no dust thrown
into the eyes. It was done in good earnest and in all sincerity.
The knives were as sharp as razors, and the old mountebank
planted them close to the flesh, exactly in the angle between the
fingers. He surrounded the head with a perfect halo of knives,
and the neck with a collar from which nobody could have
extricated himself without cutting his carotid artery, while, to
increase the difficulty, the old fellow went through the
performance without seeing, his whole face being covered with a
close mask of thick oilcloth.
Naturally, like other great artists, he was not understood by the
crowd, who confounded him with vulgar tricksters, and his mask
only appeared to them a trick the more, and a very common trick
into the bargain.
"He must think us very stupid," they said. "How could he possibly
aim without having his eyes open?"
And they thought there must be imperceptible holes in the
oilcloth, a sort of latticework concealed in the material. It was
useless for him to allow the public to examine the mask for
themselves before the exhibition began. It was all very well that
they could not discover any trick, but they were only all the
more convinced that they were being tricked. Did not the people
know that they ought to be tricked?
I had recognized a great artist in the old mountebank, and I was
quite sure that he was altogether incapable of any trickery. I
told him so, while expressing my admiration to him; and he had
been touched by my open admiration and above all by the justice I
had done him. Thus we became good friends, and he explained to
me, very modestly, the real trick which the crowd do not
understand, the eternal trick contained in these simple words:
"To be gifted by nature and to practice every day for long, long
years."
He had been especially struck by the certainty which I expressed
that any trickery must become impossible to him. "Yes," he said
to me; "quite impossible! Impossible to a degree which you cannot
imagine. If I were to tell you! But where would be the use?"
His face clouded over, and his eyes filled with tears. I did not
venture to force myself into his confidence. My looks, however,
were not so discreet as my silence, and begged him to speak; so
he responded to their mute appeal.
"After all," he said; "why should I not tell you about it? You
will understand me." And he added, with a look of sudden
ferocity: "She understood it, at any rate!"
"Who?" I asked.
"My strumpet of a wife," he replied. "Ah! Monsieur, what an
abominable creature she was--if you only knew! Yes, she
understood it too well, too well, and that is why I hate her so;
even more on that account, than for having deceived me. For that
is a natural fault, is it not, and may be pardoned? But the other
thing was a crime, a horrible crime."
The woman, who stood against the wooden target every night with
her arms stretched out and her finger extended, and whom the old
mountebank fitted with gloves and with a halo formed of his
knives, which were as sharp as razors and which he planted close
to her, was his wife. She might have been a woman of forty, and
must have been fairly pretty, but with a perverse prettiness; she
had an impudent mouth, a mouth that was at the same time sensual
and bad, with the lower lip too thick for the thin, dry upper
lip.
I had several times noticed that every time he planted a knife in
the board, she uttered a laugh, so low as scarcely to be heard,
but which was very significant when one heard it, for it was a
hard and very mocking laugh. I had always attributed that sort of
reply to an artifice which the occasion required. It was
intended, I thought, to accentuate the danger she incurred and
the contempt that she felt for it, thanks to the sureness of the
thrower's hands, and so I was very much surprised when the
mountebank said to me:
"Have you observed her laugh, I say? Her evil laugh which makes
fun of me, and her cowardly laugh which defies me? Yes, cowardly,
because she knows that nothing can happen to her, nothing, in
spite of all she deserves, in spite of all that I ought to do to
her, in spite of all that I WANT to do to her."
"What do you want to do?"
"Confound it! Cannot you guess? I want to kill her."
"To kill her, because she has--"
"Because she has deceived me? No, no, not that, I tell you again.
I have forgiven her for that a long time ago, and I am too much
accustomed to it! But the worst of it is that the first time I
forgave her, when I told her that all the same I might some day
have my revenge by cutting her throat, if I chose, without
seeming to do it on purpose, as if it were an accident, mere
awkwardness--"
"Oh! So you said that to her?"
"Of course I did, and I meant it. I thought I might be able to do
it, for you see I had the perfect right to do so. It was so
simple, so easy, so tempting! Just think! A mistake of less than
half an inch, and her skin would be cut at the neck where the
jugular vein is, and the jugular would be severed. My knives cut
very well! And when once the jugular is cut--good-bye. The blood
would spurt out, and one, two, three red jets, and all would be
over; she would be dead, and I should have had my revenge!"
"That is true, certainly, horribly true!"
"And without any risk to me, eh? An accident, that is all; bad
luck, one of those mistakes which happen every day in our
business. What could they accuse me of? Whoever would think of
accusing me, even? Homicide through imprudence, that would be
all! They would even pity me, rather than accuse me. 'My wife! My
poor wife!' I should say, sobbing. 'My wife, who is so necessary
to me, who is half the breadwinner, who takes part in my
performance!' You must acknowledge that I should be pitied!"
"Certainly; there is not the least doubt about that."
"And you must allow that such a revenge would he a very nice
revenge, the best possible revenge which I could have with
assured impunity."
"Evidently that is so."
"Very well! But when I told her so, as I have told you, and more
forcibly still; threatening her as I was mad with rage and ready
to do the deed that I had dreamed of on the spot, what do you
think she said?"
"That you were a good fellow, and would certainly not have the
atrocious courage to--"
"Tut! tut! tut! I am not such a good fellow as you think. I am
not frightened of blood, and that I have proved already, though
it would be useless to tell you how and where. But I had no
necessity to prove it to her, for she knows that I am capable of
a good many things; even of crime; especially of one crime."
"And she was not frightened?"
"No. She merely replied that I could not do what I said; you
understand. That I could not do it!"
"Why not?"
"Ah! Monsieur, so you do not understand? Why do you not? I have I
not explained to you by what constant, long, daily practice I
have learned to plant my knives without seeing what I am doing?"
"Yes, well, what then?"
"Well! Cannot you understand what she has understood with such
terrible results, that now my hand would no longer obey me if I
wished to make a mistake as I threw?"
"Is it possible?"
"Nothing is truer, I am sorry to say. For I really have wished to
have the revenge which I have dreamed of, and which I thought so
easy. Exasperated by that bad woman's insolence and confidence in
her own safety, I have several times made up my mind to kill her,
and have exerted all my energy and all my skill to make my knives
fly aside when I threw them to make a border round her neck. I
have tried with all my might to make them deviate half an inch,
just enough to cut her throat. I wanted to, and I have never
succeeded, never. And always the slut's horrible laugh makes fun
of me, always, always."
And with a deluge of tears, with something like a roar of
unsatiated and muzzled rage, he ground his teeth as he wound up:
"She knows me, the jade; she is in the secret of my work, of my
patience, of my trick, routine, whatever you may call it! She
lives in my innermost being, and sees into it more closely than
you do, or than I do myself. She knows what a faultless machine I
have become, the machine of which she makes fun, the machine
which is too well wound up, the machine which cannot get out of
order--and she knows that I CANNOT make a mistake."
THE HORLA
MAY 8. What a lovely day! I have spent all the morning lying on
the grass in front of my house, under the enormous plantain tree
which covers and shades and shelters the whole of it. I like this
part of the country; I am fond of living here because I am
attached to it by deep roots, the profound and delicate roots
which attach a man to the soil on which his ancestors were born
and died, to their traditions, their usages, their food, the
local expressions, the peculiar language of the peasants, the
smell of the soil, the hamlets, and to the atmosphere itself.
I love the house in which I grew up. From my windows I can see
the Seine, which flows by the side of my garden, on the other
side of the road, almost through my grounds, the great and wide
Seine, which goes to Rouen and Havre, and which is covered with
boats passing to and fro.
On the left, down yonder, lies Rouen, populous Rouen with its
blue roofs massing under pointed, Gothic towers. Innumerable are
they, delicate or broad, dominated by the spire of the cathedral,
full of bells which sound through the blue air on fine mornings,
sending their sweet and distant iron clang to me, their metallic
sounds, now stronger and now weaker, according as the wind is
strong or light.
What a delicious morning it was! About eleven o'clock, a long
line of boats drawn by a steam-tug, as big a fly, and which
scarcely puffed while emitting its thick smoke, passed my gate.
After two English schooners, whose red flags fluttered toward the
sky, there came a magnificent Brazilian three-master; it was
perfectly white and wonderfully clean and shining. I saluted it,
I hardly know why, except that the sight of the vessel gave me
great pleasure.
May 12. I have had a slight feverish attack for the last few
days, and I feel ill, or rather I feel low-spirited.
Whence come those mysterious influences which change our
happiness into discouragement, and our self-confidence into
diffidence? One might almost say that the air, the invisible air,
is full of unknowable Forces, whose mysterious presence we have
to endure. I wake up in the best of spirits, with an inclination
to sing in my heart. Why? I go down by the side of the water, and
suddenly, after walking a short distance, I return home wretched,
as if some misfortune were awaiting me there. Why? Is it a cold
shiver which, passing over my skin, has upset my nerves and given
me a fit of low spirits? Is it the form of the clouds, or the
tints of the sky, or the colors of the surrounding objects which
are so change-able, which have troubled my thoughts as they
passed before my eyes? Who can tell? Everything that surrounds
us, everything that we see without looking at it, everything that
we touch without knowing it, everything that we handle without
feeling it, everything that we meet without clearly
distinguishing it, has a rapid, surprising, and inexplicable
effect upon us and upon our organs, and through them on our ideas
and on our being itself.
How profound that mystery of the Invisible is! We cannot fathom
it with our miserable senses: our eyes are unable to perceive
what is either too small or too great, too near to or too far
from us; we can see neither the inhabitants of a star nor of a
drop of water; our ears deceive us, for they transmit to us the
vibrations of the air in sonorous notes. Our senses are fairies
who work the miracle of changing that movement into noise, and by
that metamorphosis give birth to music, which makes the mute
agitation of nature a harmony. So with our sense of smell, which
is weaker than that of a dog, and so with our sense of taste,
which can scarcely distinguish the age of a wine!
Oh! If we only had other organs which could work other miracles
in our favor, what a number of fresh things we might discover
around us!
May 16. I am ill, decidedly! I was so well last month! I am
feverish, horribly feverish, or rather I am in a state of
feverish enervation, which makes my mind suffer as much as my
body. I have without ceasing the horrible sensation of some
danger threatening me, the apprehension of some coming misfortune
or of approaching death, a presentiment which is no doubt, an
attack of some illness still unnamed, which germinates in the
flesh and in the blood.
May 18. I have just come from consulting my medical man, for I
can no longer get any sleep. He found that my pulse was high, my
eyes dilated, my nerves highly strung, but no alarming symptoms.
I must have a course of shower baths and of bromide of potassium.
May 25. No change! My state is really very peculiar. As the
evening comes on, an incomprehensible feeling of disquietude
seizes me, just as if night concealed some terrible menace toward
me. I dine quickly, and then try to read, but I do not understand
the words, and can scarcely distinguish the letters. Then I walk
up and down my drawing-room, oppressed by a feeling of confused
and irresistible fear, a fear of sleep and a fear of my bed.
About ten o'clock I go up to my room. As soon as I have entered I
lock and bolt the door. I am frightened--of what? Up till the
present time I have been frightened of nothing. I open my
cupboards, and look under my bed; I listen--I listen--to what?
How strange it is that a simple feeling of discomfort, of impeded
or heightened circulation, perhaps the irritation of a nervous
center, a slight congestion, a small disturbance in the imperfect
and delicate functions of our living machinery, can turn the most
light-hearted of men into a melancholy one, and make a coward of
the bravest? Then, I go to bed, and I wait for sleep as a man
might wait for the executioner. I wait for its coming with dread,
and my heart beats and my legs tremble, while my whole body
shivers beneath the warmth of the bedclothes, until the moment
when I suddenly fall asleep, as a man throws himself into a pool
of stagnant water in order to drown. I do not feel this
perfidious sleep coming over me as I used to, but a sleep which
is close to me and watching me, which is going to seize me by the
head, to close my eyes and annihilate me.
I sleep--a long time--two or three hours perhaps--then a
dream--no--a nightmare lays hold on me. I feel that I am in bed
and asleep--I feel it and I know it--and I feel also that
somebody is coming close to me, is looking at me, touching me, is
getting on to my bed, is kneeling on my chest, is taking my neck
between his hands and squeezing it--squeezing it with all his
might in order to strangle me.
I struggle, bound by that terrible powerlessness which paralyzes
us in our dreams; I try to cry out--but I cannot; I want to
move--I cannot; I try, with the most violent efforts and out of
breath, to turn over and throw off this being which is crushing
and suffocating me--I cannot!
And then suddenly I wake up, shaken and bathed in perspiration; I
light a candle and find that I am alone, and after that crisis,
which occurs every night, I at length fall asleep and slumber
tranquilly till morning.
June 2. My state has grown worse. What is the matter with me? The
bromide does me no good, and the shower-baths have no effect
whatever. Sometimes, in order to tire myself out, though I am
fatigued enough already, I go for a walk in the forest of
Roumare. I used to think at first that the fresh light and soft
air, impregnated with the odor of herbs and leaves, would instill
new life into my veins and impart fresh energy to my heart. One
day I turned into a broad ride in the wood, and then I diverged
toward La Bouille, through a narrow path, between two rows of
exceedingly tall trees, which placed a thick, green, almost black
roof between the sky and me.
A sudden shiver ran through me, not a cold shiver, but a shiver
of agony, and so I hastened my steps, uneasy at being alone in
the wood, frightened stupidly and without reason, at the profound
solitude. Suddenly it seemed as if I were being followed, that
somebody was walking at my heels, close, quite close to me, near
enough to touch me.
I turned round suddenly, but I was alone. I saw nothing behind me
except the straight, broad ride, empty and bordered by high
trees, horribly empty; on the other side also it extended until
it was lost in the distance, and looked just the same--terrible.
I closed my eyes. Why? And then I began to turn round on one heel
very quickly, just like a top. I nearly fell down, and opened my
eyes; the trees were dancing round me and the earth heaved; I was
obliged to sit down. Then, ah! I no longer remembered how I had
come! What a strange idea! What a strange, strange idea! I did
not the least know. I started off to the right, and got back into
the avenue which had led me into the middle of the forest.
June 3. I have had a terrible night. I shall go away for a few
weeks, for no doubt a journey will set me up again.
July 2. I have come back, quite cured, and have had a most
delightful trip into the bargain. I have been to Mont
Saint-Michel, which I had not seen before.
What a sight, when one arrives as I did, at Avranches toward the
end of the day! The town stands on a hill, and I was taken into
the public garden at the extremity of the town. I uttered a cry
of astonishment. An extraordinarily large bay lay extended before
me, as far as my eyes could reach, between two hills which were
lost to sight in the mist; and in the middle of this immense
yellow bay, under a clear, golden sky, a peculiar hill rose up,
somber and pointed in the midst of the sand. The sun had just
disappeared, and under the still flaming sky stood out the
outline of that fantastic rock which bears on its summit a
picturesque monument.
At daybreak I went to it. The tide was low, as it had been the
night before, and I saw that wonderful abbey rise up before me as
I approached it. After several hours' walking, I reached the
enormous mass of rock which supports the little town, dominated
by the great church. Having climbed the steep and narrow street,
I entered the most wonderful Gothic building that has ever been
erected to God on earth, large as a town, and full of low rooms
which seem buried beneath vaulted roofs, and of lofty galleries
supported by delicate columns.
I entered this gigantic granite jewel, which is as light in its
effect as a bit of lace and is covered with towers, with slender
belfries to which spiral staircases ascend. The flying buttresses
raise strange heads that bristle with chimeras. with devils, with
fantastic ani-mals, with monstrous flowers, are joined together
by finely carved arches, to the blue sky by day, and to the black
sky by night.
When I had reached the summit. I said to the monk who accompanied
me: "Father, how happy you must be here!" And he replied: "It is
very windy, Monsieur"; and so we began to talk while watching the
rising tide, which ran over the sand and covered it with a steel
cuirass.
And then the monk told me stories, all the old stories belonging
to the place--legends, nothing but legends.
One of them struck me forcibly. The country people, those
belonging to the Mornet, declare that at night one can hear
talking going on in the sand, and also that two goats bleat, one
with a strong, the other with a weak voice. Incredulous people
declare that it is nothing but the screaming of the sea birds,
which occasionally resembles bleatings, and occasionally human
lamentations; but belated fishermen swear that they have met an
old shepherd, whose cloak covered head they can never see,
wandering on the sand, between two tides, round the little town
placed so far out of the world. They declare he is guiding and
walking before a he-goat with a man's face and a she-goat with a
woman's face, both with white hair, who talk incessantly,
quarreling in a strange language, and then suddenly cease talking
in order to bleat with all their might.
"Do you believe it?" I asked the monk. "I scarcely know," he
replied; and I continued: "If there are other beings besides
ourselves on this earth, how comes it that we have not known it
for so long a time, or why have you not seen them? How is it that
I have not seen them?"
He replied: "Do we see the hundred-thousandth part of what
exists? Look here; there is the wind, which is the strongest
force in nature. It knocks down men, and blows down buildings,
uproots trees, raises the sea into mountains of water, destroys
cliffs and casts great ships on to the breakers; it kills, it
whistles, it sighs, it roars. But have you ever seen it, and can
you see it? Yet it exists for all that."
I was silent before this simple reasoning. That man was a
philosopher, or perhaps a fool; I could not say which exactly, so
I held my tongue. What he had said had often been in my own
thoughts.
July 3. I have slept badly; certainly there is some feverish
influence here, for my coachman is suffering in the same way as I
am. When I went back home yesterday, I noticed his singular
paleness, and I asked him: "What is the matter with you, Jean?"
"The matter is that I never get any rest, and my nights devour my
days. Since your departure, Monsieur, there has been a spell over
me."
However, the other servants are all well, but I am very
frightened of having another attack, myself.
July 4. I am decidedly taken again; for my old nightmares have
returned. Last night I felt somebody leaning on me who was
sucking my life from between my lips with his mouth. Yes, he was
sucking it out of my neck like a leech would have done. Then he
got up, satiated, and I woke up, so beaten, crushed, and
annihilated that I could not move. If this continues for a few
days, I shall certainly go away again.
July 5. Have I lost my reason? What has happened? What I saw last
night is so strange that my head wanders when I think of it!
As I do now every evening, I had locked my door; then, being
thirsty, I drank half a glass of water, and I accidentally
noticed that the water-bottle was full up to the cut-glass
stopper.
Then I went to bed and fell into one of my terrible sleeps, from
which I was aroused in about two hours by a still more terrible
shock.
Picture to yourself a sleeping man who is being murdered, who
wakes up with a knife in his chest, a gurgling in his throat, is
covered with blood, can no longer breathe, is going to die and
does not understand anything at all about it--there you have it.
Having recovered my senses, I was thirsty again, so I lighted a
candle and went to the table on which my water-bottle was. I
lifted it up and tilted it over my glass, but nothing came out.
It was empty! It was completely empty! At first I could not
understand it at all; then suddenly I was seized by such a
terrible feeling that I had to sit down, or rather fall into a
chair! Then I sprang up with a bound to look about me; then I sat
down again, overcome by astonishment and fear, in front of the
transparent crystal bottle! I looked at it with fixed eyes,
trying to solve the puzzle, and my hands trembled! Some body had
drunk the water, but who? I? I without any doubt. It could surely
only be I? In that case I was a somnambulist--was living, without
knowing it, that double, mysterious life which makes us doubt
whether there are not two beings in us--whether a strange,
unknowable, and invisible being does not, during our moments of
mental and physical torpor, animate the inert body, forcing it to
a more willing obedience than it yields to ourselves.
Oh! Who will understand my horrible agony? Who will understand
the emotion of a man sound in mind, wide-awake, full of sense,
who looks in horror at the disappearance of a little water while
he was asleep, through the glass of a water-bottle! And I
remained sitting until it was daylight, without venturing to go
to bed again.
July 6. I am going mad. Again all the contents of my water-bottle
have been drunk during the night; or rather I have drunk it!
But is it I? Is it I? Who could it be? Who? Oh! God! Am I going
mad? Who will save me?
July 10. I have just been through some surprising ordeals.
Undoubtedly I must be mad! And yet!
On July 6, before going to bed, I put some wine, milk, water,
bread, and strawberries on my table. Somebody drank--I drank--all
the water and a little of the milk, but neither the wine, nor the
bread, nor the strawberries were touched.
On the seventh of July I renewed the same experiment, with the
same results, and on July 8 I left out the water and the milk and
nothing was touched.
Lastly, on July 9 I put only water and milk on my table, taking
care to wrap up the bottles in white muslin and to tie down the
stoppers. Then I rubbed my lips, my beard, and my hands with
pencil lead, and went to bed.
Deep slumber seized me, soon followed by a terrible awakening. I
had not moved, and my sheets were not marked. I rushed to the
table. The muslin round the bottles remained intact; I undid the
string, trembling with fear. All the water had been drunk, and so
had the milk! Ah! Great God! I must start for Paris immediately.
July 12. Paris. I must have lost my head during the last few
days! I must be the plaything of my enervated imagination, unless
I am really a somnambulist, or I have been brought under the
power of one of those influences--hypnotic suggestion, for
example--which are known to exist, but have hitherto been
inexplicable. In any case, my mental state bordered on madness,
and twenty-four hours of Paris sufficed to restore me to my
equilibrium.
Yesterday after doing some business and paying some visits, which
instilled fresh and invigorating mental air into me, I wound up
my evening at the Theatre Francais. A drama by Alexander Dumas
the Younger was being acted, and his brilliant and powerful play
completed my cure. Certainly solitude is dangerous for active
minds. We need men who can think and can talk, around us. When we
are alone for a long time, we people space with phantoms.
I returned along the boulevards to my hotel in excellent spirits.
Amid the jostling of the crowd I thought, not without irony, of
my terrors and surmises of the previous week, because I believed,
yes, I believed, that an invisible being lived beneath my roof.
How weak our mind is; how quickly it is terrified and unbalanced
as soon as we are confronted with a small, incomprehensible fact.
Instead of dismissing the problem with: "We do not understand
because we cannot find the cause," we immediately imagine
terrible mysteries and supernatural powers.
July 14. Fete of the Republic. I walked through the streets, and
the crackers and flags amused me like a child. Still, it is very
foolish to make merry on a set date, by Government decree. People
are like a flock of sheep, now steadily patient, now in ferocious
revolt. Say to it: "Amuse yourself," and it amuses itself. Say to
it: "Go and fight with your neighbor," and it goes and fights.
Say to it: "Vote for the Emperor," and it votes for the Emperor;
then say to it: "Vote for the Republic," and it votes for the
Republic.
Those who direct it are stupid, too; but instead of obeying men
they obey principles, a course which can only be foolish,
ineffective, and false, for the very reason that principles are
ideas which are considered as certain and unchangeable, whereas
in this world one is certain of nothing, since light is an
illusion and noise is deception.
July 16. I saw some things yesterday that troubled me very much.
I was dining at my cousin's, Madame Sable, whose husband is
colonel of the Seventy-sixth Chasseurs at Limoges. There were two
young women there, one of whom had married a medical man, Dr.
Parent, who devotes himself a great deal to nervous diseases and
to the extraordinary manifestations which just now experiments in
hypnotism and suggestion are producing.
He related to us at some length the enormous results obtained by
English scientists and the doctors of the medical school at
Nancy, and the facts which he adduced appeared to me so strange,
that I declared that I was altogether incredulous.
"We are," he declared, "on the point of discovering one of the
most important secrets of nature, I mean to say, one of its most
important secrets on this earth, for assuredly there are some up
in the stars, yonder, of a different kind of importance. Ever
since man has thought, since he has been able to express and
write down his thoughts, he has felt himself close to a mystery
which is impenetrable to his coarse and imperfect senses, and he
endeavors to supplement the feeble penetration of his organs by
the efforts of his intellect. As long as that intellect remained
in its elementary stage, this intercourse with invisible spirits
assumed forms which were commonplace though terrifying. Thence
sprang the popular belief in the supernatural, the legends of
wandering spirits, of fairies, of gnomes, of ghosts, I might even
say the conception of God, for our ideas of the Workman-Creator,
from whatever religion they may have come down to us, are
certainly the most mediocre, the stupidest, and the most
unacceptable inventions that ever sprang from the frightened
brain of any human creature. Nothing is truer than what Voltaire
says: 'If God made man in His own image, man has certainly paid
Him back again.'
"But for rather more than a century, men seem to have had a
presentiment of something new. Mesmer and some others have put us
on an unexpected track, and within the last two or three years
especially, we have arrived at results really surprising."
My cousin, who is also very incredulous, smiled, and Dr. Parent
said to her: "Would you like me to try and send you to sleep,
Madame?"
"Yes, certainly."
She sat down in an easy-chair, and he began to look at her
fixedly, as if to fascinate her. I suddenly felt myself somewhat
discomposed; my heart beat rapidly and I had a choking feeling in
my throat. I saw that Madame Sable's eyes were growing heavy, her
mouth twitched, and her bosom heaved, and at the end of ten
minutes she was asleep.
"Go behind her," the doctor said to me; so I took a seat behind
her. He put a visiting-card into her hands, and said to her:
"This is a looking-glass; what do you see in it?"
She replied: "I see my cousin."
"What is he doing?"
"He is twisting his mustache."
"And now?"
"He is taking a photograph out of his pocket."
"Whose photograph is it?"
"His own."
That was true, for the photograph had been given me that same
evening at the hotel.
"What is his attitude in this portrait?"
"He is standing up with his hat in his hand."
She saw these things in that card, in that piece of white
pasteboard, as if she had seen them in a looking-glass.
The young women were frightened, and exclaimed: "That is quite
enough! Quite, quite enough!"
But the doctor said to her authoritatively: "You will get up at
eight o'clock to-morrow morning; then you will go and call on
your cousin at his hotel and ask him to lend you the five
thousand francs which your husband asks of you, and which he will
ask for when he sets out on his coming journey."
Then he woke her up.
On returning to my hotel, I thought over this curious seance and
I was assailed by doubts, not as to my cousin's absolute and
undoubted good faith, for I had known her as well as if she had
been my own sister ever since she was a child, but as to a
possible trick on the doctor's part. Had not he, perhaps, kept a
glass hidden in his hand, which he showed to the young woman in
her sleep at the same time as he did the card? Professional
conjurers do things which are just as singular.
However, I went to bed, and this morning, at about half past
eight, I was awakened by my footman, who said to me: "Madame
Sable has asked to see you immediately, Monsieur." I dressed
hastily and went to her.
She sat down in some agitation, with her eyes on the floor, and
without raising her veil said to me: "My dear cousin, I am going
to ask a great favor of you."
"What is it, cousin?"
"I do not like to tell you, and yet I must. I am in absolute want
of five thousand francs."
"What, you?"
"Yes, I, or rather my husband, who has asked me to procure them
for him."
I was so stupefied that I hesitated to answer. I asked myself
whether she had not really been making fun of me with Dr. Parent,
if it were not merely a very well-acted farce which had been got
up beforehand. On looking at her attentively, however, my doubts
disappeared. She was trembling with grief, so painful was this
step to her, and I was sure that her throat was full of sobs.
I knew that she was very rich and so I continued: "What! Has not
your husband five thousand francs at his disposal? Come, think.
Are you sure that he commissioned you to ask me for them?"
She hesitated for a few seconds, as if she were making a great
effort to search her memory, and then she replied: "Yes--yes, I
am quite sure of it."
"He has written to you?"
She hesitated again and reflected, and I guessed the torture of
her thoughts. She did not know. She only knew that she was to
borrow five thousand francs of me for her husband. So she told a
lie.
"Yes, he has written to me."
"When, pray? You did not mention it to me yesterday."
"I received his letter this morning."
"Can you show it to me?"
"No; no--no--it contained private matters, things too personal to
ourselves. I burned it."
"So your husband runs into debt?"
She hesitated again, and then murmured: "I do not know."
Thereupon I said bluntly: "I have not five thousand francs at my
disposal at this moment, my dear cousin."
She uttered a cry, as if she were in pair; and said: "Oh! oh! I
beseech you, I beseech you to get them for me."
She got excited and clasped her hands as if she were praying to
me! I heard her voice change its tone; she wept and sobbed,
harassed and dominated by the irresistible order that she had
received.
"Oh! oh! I beg you to--if you knew what I am suffering--I want
them to-day."
I had pity on her: "You shall have them by and by, I swear to
you."
"Oh! thank you! thank you! How kind you are."
I continued: "Do you remember what took place at your house last
night?"
"Yes."
"Do you remember that Dr. Parent sent you to sleep?"
"Yes."
"Oh! Very well then; he ordered you to come to me this morning to
borrow five thousand francs, and at this moment you are obeying
that suggestion."
She considered for a few moments, and then replied: "But as it is
my husband who wants them--"
For a whole hour I tried to convince her, but could not succeed,
and when she had gone I went to the doctor. He was just going
out, and he listened to me with a smile, and said: "Do you
believe now?"
"Yes, I cannot help it."
"Let us go to your cousin's."
She was already resting on a couch, overcome with fatigue. The
doctor felt her pulse, looked at her for some time with one hand
raised toward her eyes, which she closed by degrees under the
irresistible power of this magnetic influence. When she was
asleep, he said:
"Your husband does not require the five thousand francs any
longer! You must, therefore, forget that you asked your cousin to
lend them to you, and, if he speaks to you about it, you will not
understand him."
Then he woke her up, and I took out a pocket-book and said: "Here
is what you asked me for this morning, my dear cousin." But she
was so surprised, that I did not venture to persist;
nevertheless, I tried to recall the circumstance to her, but she
denied it vigorously, thought that I was making fun of her, and
in the end, very nearly lost her temper.
There! I have just come back, and I have not been able to eat any
lunch, for this experiment has altogether upset me.
July 19. Many people to whom I have told the adventure have
laughed at me. I no longer know what to think. The wise man says:
Perhaps?
July 21. I dined at Bougival, and then I spent the evening at a
boatmen's ball. Decidedly everything depends on place and
surroundings. It would be the height of folly to believe in the
supernatural on the Ile de la Grenouilliere.[1] But on the top of
Mont Saint-Michel or in India, we are terribly under the
influence of our surroundings. I shall return home next week.
[1] Frog-island.
July 30. I came back to my own house yesterday. Everything is
going on well.
August 2. Nothing fresh; it is splendid weather, and I spend my
days in watching the Seine flow past.
August 4. Quarrels among my servants. They declare that the
glasses are broken in the cupboards at night. The footman accuses
the cook, she accuses the needlewoman, and the latter accuses the
other two. Who is the culprit? It would take a clever person to
tell.
August 6. This time, I am not mad. I have seen --I have seen--I
have seen!--I can doubt no longer --I have seen it!
I was walking at two o'clock among my rose-trees, in the full
sunlight--in the walk bordered by autumn roses which are
beginning to fall. As I stopped to look at a Geant de Bataille,
which had three splendid blooms, I distinctly saw the stalk of
one of the roses bend close to me, as if an invisible hand had
bent it, and then break, as if that hand had picked it! Then the
flower raised itself, following the curve which a hand would have
described in carrying it toward a mouth, and remained suspended
in the transparent air, alone and motionless, a terrible red
spot, three yards from my eyes. In desperation I rushed at it to
take it! I found nothing; it had disappeared. Then I was seized
with furious rage against myself, for it is not wholesome for a
reasonable and serious man to have such hallucinations.
But was it a hallucination? I turned to look for the stalk, and I
found it immediately under the bush, freshly broken, between the
two other roses which remained on the branch. I returned home,
then, with a much disturbed mind; for I am certain now, certain
as I am of the alternation of day and night, that there exists
close to me an invisible being who lives on milk and on water,
who can touch objects, take them and change their places; who is,
consequently, endowed with a material nature, although
imperceptible to sense, and who lives as I do, under my roof--
August 7. I slept tranquilly. He drank the water out of my
decanter, but did not disturb my sleep.
I ask myself whether I am mad. As I was walking just now in the
sun by the riverside, doubts as to my own sanity arose in me; not
vague doubts such as I have had hitherto, but precise and
absolute doubts. I have seen mad people, and I have known some
who were quite intelligent, lucid, even clear-sighted in every
concern of life, except on one point. They could speak clearly,
readily, profoundly on everything; till their thoughts were
caught in the breakers of their delusions and went to pieces
there, were dispersed and swamped in that furious and terrible
sea of fogs and squalls which is called MADNESS.
I certainly should think that I was mad, absolutely mad, if I
were not conscious that I knew my state, if I could not fathom it
and analyze it with the most complete lucidity. I should, in
fact, be a reasonable man laboring under a hallucination. Some
unknown disturbance must have been excited in my brain, one of
those disturbances which physiologists of the present day try to
note and to fix precisely, and that disturbance must have caused
a profound gulf in my mind and in the order and logic of my
ideas. Similar phenomena occur in dreams, and lead us through the
most unlikely phantasmagoria, without causing us any surprise,
because our verifying apparatus and our sense of control have
gone to sleep, while our imaginative faculty wakes and works. Was
it not possible that one of the imperceptible keys of the
cerebral finger-board had been paralyzed in me? Some men lose the
recollection of proper names, or of verbs, or of numbers, or
merely of dates, in consequence of an accident. The localization
of all the avenues of thought has been accomplished nowadays;
what, then, would there be surprising in the fact that my faculty
of controlling the unreality of certain hallucinations should be
destroyed for the time being?
I thought of all this as I walked by the side of the water. The
sun was shining brightly on the river and made earth delightful,
while it filled me with love for life, for the swallows, whose
swift agility is always delightful in my eyes, for the plants by
the riverside, whose rustling is a pleasure to my ears.
By degrees, however, an inexplicable feeling of discomfort seized
me. It seemed to me as if some unknown force were numbing and
stopping me, were preventing me from going further and were
calling me back. I felt that painful wish to return which comes
on you when you have left a beloved invalid at home, and are
seized by a presentiment that he is worse.
I, therefore, returned despite of myself, feeling certain that I
should find some bad news awaiting me, a letter or a telegram.
There was nothing, however, and I was surprised and uneasy, more
so than if I had had another fantastic vision.
August 8. I spent a terrible evening, yesterday. He does not show
himself any more, but I feel that He is near me, watching me,
looking at me, penetrating me, dominating me, and more terrible
to me when He hides himself thus than if He were to manifest his
constant and invisible presence by supernatural phenomena.
However, I slept.
August 9. Nothing, but I am afraid.
August 10. Nothing; but what will happen to-morrow?
August 11. Still nothing. I cannot stop at home with this fear
hanging over me and these thoughts in my mind; I shall go away.
August 12. Ten o'clock at night. All day long I have been trying
to get away, and have not been able. I contemplated a simple and
easy act of liberty, a carriage ride to Rouen--and I have not
been able to do it. What is the reason?
August 13. When one is attacked by certain maladies, the springs
of our physical being seem broken, our energies destroyed, our
muscles relaxed, our bones to be as soft as our flesh, and our
blood as liquid as water. I am experiencing the same in my moral
being, in a strange and distressing manner. I have no longer any
strength, any courage, any self-control, nor even any power to
set my own will in motion. I have no power left to WILL anything,
but some one does it for me and I obey.
August 14. I am lost! Somebody possesses my soul and governs it!
Somebody orders all my acts, all my movements, all my thoughts. I
am no longer master of myself, nothing except an enslaved and
terrified spectator of the things which I do. I wish to go out; I
cannot. HE does not wish to; and so I remain, trembling and
distracted in the armchair in which he keeps me sitting. I merely
wish to get up and to rouse myself, so as to think that I am
still master of myself: I cannot! I am riveted to my chair, and
my chair adheres to the floor in such a manner that no force of
mine can move us.
Then suddenly, I must, I MUST go to the foot of my garden to pick
some strawberries and eat them --and I go there. I pick the
strawberries and I eat them! Oh! my God! my God! Is there a God?
If there be one, deliver me! save me! succor me! Pardon! Pity!
Mercy! Save me! Oh! what sufferings! what torture! what horror!
August 15. Certainly this is the way in which my poor cousin was
possessed and swayed, when she came to borrow five thousand
francs of me. She was under the power of a strange will which had
entered into her, like another soul, a parasitic and ruling soul.
Is the world coming to an end?
But who is he, this invisible being that rules me, this
unknowable being, this rover of a supernatural race?
Invisible beings exist, then! how is it, then, that since the
beginning of the world they have never manifested themselves in
such a manner as they do to me? I have never read anything that
resembles what goes on in my house. Oh! If I could only leave it,
if I could only go away and flee, and never return, I should be
saved; but I cannot.
August 16. I managed to escape to-day for two hours, like a
prisoner who finds the door of his dungeon accidentally open. I
suddenly felt that I was free and that He was far away, and so I
gave orders to put the horses in as quickly as possible, and I
drove to Rouen. Oh! how delightful to be able to say to my
coachman: "Go to Rouen!"
I made him pull up before the library, and I begged them to lend
me Dr. Herrmann Herestauss's treatise on the unknown inhabitants
of the ancient and modern world.
Then, as I was getting into my carriage, I intended to say: "To
the railway station!" but instead of this I shouted--I did not
speak; but I shouted--in such a loud voice that all the
passers-by turned round: "Home!" and I fell back on to the
cushion of my carriage, overcome by mental agony. He had found me
out and regained possession of me.
August 17. Oh! What a night! what a night! And yet it seems to me
that I ought to rejoice. I read until one o'clock in the morning!
Herestauss, Doctor of Philosophy and Theogony, wrote the history
and the manifestation of all those invisible beings which hover
around man, or of whom he dreams. He describes their origin,
their domains, their power; but none of them resembles the one
which haunts me. One might say that man, ever since he has
thought, has had a foreboding and a fear of a new being, stronger
than himself, his successor in this world, and that, feeling him
near, and not being able to foretell the nature of the unseen
one, he has, in his terror, created the whole race of hidden
beings, vague phantoms born of fear.
Having, therefore, read until one o'clock in the morning, I went
and sat down at the open window, in order to cool my forehead and
my thoughts in the calm night air. It was very pleasant and warm!
How I should have enjoyed such a night formerly!
There was no moon, but the stars darted out their rays in the
dark heavens. Who inhabits those worlds? What forms, what living
beings, what animals are there yonder? Do those who are thinkers
in those distant worlds know more than we do? What can they do
more than we? What do they see which we do not? Will not one of
them, some day or other, traversing space, appear on our earth to
conquer it, just as formerly the Norsemen crossed the sea in
order to subjugate nations feebler than themselves?
We are so weak, so powerless, so ignorant, so small--we who live
on this particle of mud which revolves in liquid air.
I fell asleep, dreaming thus in the cool night air, and then,
having slept for about three quarters of an hour, I opened my
eyes without moving, awakened by an indescribably confused and
strange sensation. At first I saw nothing, and then suddenly it
appeared to me as if a page of the book, which had remained open
on my table, turned over of its own accord. Not a breath of air
had come in at my window, and I was surprised and waited. In
about four minutes, I saw, I saw--yes I saw with my own
eyes--another page lift itself up and fall down on the others, as
if a finger had turned it over. My armchair was empty, appeared
empty, but I knew that He was there, He, and sitting in my place,
and that He was reading. With a furious bound, the bound of an
enraged wild beast that wishes to disembowel its tamer, I crossed
my room to seize him, to strangle him, to kill him! But before I
could reach it, my chair fell over as if somebody had run away
from me. My table rocked, my lamp fell and went out, and my
window closed as if some thief had been surprised and had fled
out into the night, shutting it behind him.
So He had run away; He had been afraid; He, afraid of me!
So to-morrow, or later--some day or other, I should be able to
hold him in my clutches and crush him against the ground! Do not
dogs occasionally bite and strangle their masters?
August 18. I have been thinking the whole day long. Oh! yes, I
will obey Him, follow His impulses, fulfill all His wishes, show
myself humble, submissive, a coward. He is the stronger; but an
hour will come.
August 19. I know, I know, I know all! I have just read the
following in the "Revue du Monde Scientifique": "A curious piece
of news comes to us from Rio de Janeiro. Madness, an epidemic of
madness, which may be compared to that contagious madness which
attacked the people of Europe in the Middle Ages, is at this
moment raging in the Province of San-Paulo. The frightened
inhabitants are leaving their houses, deserting their villages,
abandoning their land, saying that they are pursued, possessed,
governed like human cattle by invisible, though tangible beings,
by a species of vampire, which feeds on their life while they are
asleep, and which, besides, drinks water and milk without
appearing to touch any other nourishment.
"Professor Don Pedro Henriques, accompanied by several medical
savants, has gone to the Province of San-Paulo, in order to study
the origin and the manifestations of this surprising madness on
the spot, and to propose such measures to the Emperor as may
appear to him to be most fitted to restore the mad population to
reason."
Ah! Ah! I remember now that fine Brazilian three-master which
passed in front of my windows as it was going up the Seine, on
the eighth of last May! I thought it looked so pretty, so white
and bright! That Being was on board of her, coming from there,
where its race sprang from. And it saw me! It saw my house, which
was also white, and He sprang from the ship on to the land. Oh!
Good heavens!
Now I know, I can divine. The reign of man is over, and he has
come. He whom disquieted priests exorcised, whom sorcerers evoked
on dark nights, without seeing him appear, He to whom the
imaginations of the transient masters of the world lent all the
monstrous or graceful forms of gnomes, spirits, genii, fairies,
and familiar spirits. After the coarse conceptions of primitive
fear, men more enlightened gave him a truer form. Mesmer divined
him, and ten years ago physicians accurately discovered the
nature of his power, even before He exercised it himself. They
played with that weapon of their new Lord, the sway of a
mysterious will over the human soul, which had become enslaved.
They called it mesmerism, hypnotism, suggestion, I know not what?
I have seen them diverting themselves like rash children with
this horrible power! Woe to us! Woe to man! He has come,
the--the--what does He call himself--the--I fancy that he is
shouting out his name to me and I do not hear him--the--yes--He
is shouting it out--I am listening--I
cannot--repeat--it--Horla--I have heard--the Horla--it is He--the
Horla--He has come!--
Ah! the vulture has eaten the pigeon, the wolf has eaten the
lamb; the lion has devoured the sharp-horned buffalo; man has
killed the lion with an arrow, with a spear, with gunpowder; but
the Horla will make of man what man has made of the horse and of
the ox: his chattel, his slave, and his food, by the mere power
of his will. Woe to us!
But, nevertheless, sometimes the animal rebels and kills the man
who has subjugated it. I should also like--I shall be able
to--but I must know Him, touch Him, see Him! Learned men say that
eyes of animals, as they differ from ours, do not distinguish as
ours do. And my eye cannot distinguish this newcomer who is
oppressing me.
Why? Oh! Now I remember the words of the monk at Mont
Saint-Michel: "Can we see the hundred-thousandth part of what
exists? Listen; there is the wind which is the strongest force in
nature; it knocks men down, blows down buildings, uproots trees,
raises the sea into mountains of water, destroys cliffs, and
casts great ships on to the breakers; it kills, it whistles, it
sighs, it roars,--have you ever seen it, and can you see it? It
exists for all that, however!"
And I went on thinking: my eyes are so weak, so imperfect, that
they do not even distinguish hard bodies, if they are as
transparent as glass! If a glass without quicksilver behind it
were to bar my way, I should run into it, just like a bird which
has flown into a room breaks its head against the windowpanes. A
thousand things, moreover, deceive a man and lead him astray. How
then is it surprising that he cannot perceive a new body which is
penetrated and pervaded by the light?
A new being! Why not? It was assuredly bound to come! Why should
we be the last? We do not distinguish it, like all the others
created before us? The reason is, that its nature is more
delicate, its body finer and more finished than ours. Our makeup
is so weak, so awkwardly conceived; our body is encumbered with
organs that are always tired, always being strained like locks
that are too complicated; it lives like a plant and like an
animal nourishing itself with difficulty on air, herbs, and
flesh; it is a brute machine which is a prey to maladies, to
malformations, to decay; it is broken-winded, badly regulated,
simple and eccentric, ingeniously yet badly made, a coarse and
yet a delicate mechanism, in brief, the outline of a being which
might become intelligent and great.
There are only a few--so few--stages of development in this
world, from the oyster up to man. Why should there not be one
more, when once that period is accomplished which separates the
successive products one from the other?
Why not one more? Why not, also, other trees with immense,
splendid flowers, perfuming whole regions? Why not other elements
beside fire, air, earth, and water? There are four, only four,
nursing fathers of various beings! What a pity! Why should not
there be forty, four hundred, four thousand! How poor everything
is, how mean and wretched--grudgingly given, poorly invented,
clumsily made! Ah! the elephant and the hippopotamus, what power!
And the camel, what suppleness!
But the butterfly, you will say, a flying flower! I dream of one
that should be as large as a hundred worlds, with wings whose
shape, beauty, colors, and motion I cannot even express. But I
see it--it flutters from star to star, refreshing them and
perfuming them with the light and harmonious breath of its
flight! And the people up there gaze at it as it passes in an
ecstasy of delight!
What is the matter with me? It is He, the Horla who haunts me,
and who makes me think of these foolish things! He is within me,
He is becoming my soul; I shall kill him!
August 20. I shall kill Him. I have seen Him! Yesterday I sat
down at my table and pretended to write very assiduously. I knew
quite well that He would come prowling round me, quite close to
me, so close that I might perhaps be able to touch him, to seize
him. And then--then I should have the strength of desperation; I
should have my hands, my knees, my chest, my forehead, my teeth
to strangle him, to crush him, to bite him, to tear him to
pieces. And I watched for him with all my overexcited nerves.
I had lighted my two lamps and the eight wax candles on my
mantelpiece, as if, by this light I should discover Him.
My bed, my old oak bed with its columns, was opposite to me; on
my right was the fireplace; on my left the door, which was
carefully closed, after I had left it open for some time, in
order to attract Him; behind me was a very high wardrobe with a
looking-glass in it, which served me to dress by every day, and
in which I was in the habit of inspecting myself from head to
foot every time I passed it.
So I pretended to be writing in order to deceive Him, for He also
was watching me, and suddenly I felt, I was certain, that He was
reading over my shoulder, that He was there, almost touching my
ear.
I got up so quickly, with my hands extended, that I almost fell.
Horror! It was as bright as at midday, but I did not see myself
in the glass! It was empty, clear, profound, full of light! But
my figure was not reflected in it--and I, I was opposite to it! I
saw the large, clear glass from top to bottom, and I looked at it
with unsteady eyes. I did not dare advance; I did not venture to
make a movement; feeling certain, nevertheless, that He was
there, but that He would escape me again, He whose imperceptible
body had absorbed my reflection.
How frightened I was! And then suddenly I began to see myself
through a mist in the depths of the looking-glass, in a mist as
it were, or through a veil of water; and it seemed to me as if
this water were flowing slowly from left to right, and making my
figure clearer every moment. It was like the end of an eclipse.
Whatever hid me did not appear to possess any clearly defined
outlines, but was a sort of opaque transparency, which gradually
grew clearer.
At last I was able to distinguish myself completely, as I do
every day when I look at myself.
I had seen Him! And the horror of it remained with me, and makes
me shudder even now.
August 21. How could I kill Him, since I could not get hold of
Him? Poison? But He would see me mix it with the water; and then,
would our poisons have any effect on His impalpable body?
No--no--no doubt about the matter. Then?--then?
August 22. I sent for a blacksmith from Rouen and ordered iron
shutters of him for my room, such as some private hotels in Paris
have on the ground floor, for fear of thieves, and he is going to
make me a similar door as well. I have made myself out a coward,
but I do not care about that!
September 10. Rouen, Hotel Continental. It is done; it is
done--but is He dead? My mind is thoroughly upset by what I have
seen.
Well then, yesterday, the locksmith having put on the iron
shutters and door, I left everything open until midnight,
although it was getting cold.
Suddenly I felt that He was there, and joy, mad joy took
possession of me. I got up softly, and I walked to the right and
left for some time, so that He might not guess anything; then I
took off my boots and put on my slippers carelessly; then I
fastened the iron shutters and going back to the door quickly I
double-locked it with a padlock, putting the key into my pocket.
Suddenly I noticed that He was moving restlessly round me, that
in his turn He was frightened and was ordering me to let Him out.
I nearly yielded, though I did not quite, but putting my back to
the door, I half opened it, just enough to allow me to go out
backward, and as I am very tall, my head touched the lintel. I
was sure that He had not been able to escape, and I shut Him up
quite alone, quite alone. What happiness! I had Him fast. Then I
ran downstairs into the drawing-room which was under my bedroom.
I took the two lamps and poured all the oil on to the carpet, the
furniture, everywhere; then I set fire to it and made my escape,
after having carefully double locked the door.
I went and hid myself at the bottom of the garden, in a clump of
laurel bushes. How long it was! how long it was! Everything was
dark, silent, motionless, not a breath of air and not a star, but
heavy banks of clouds which one could not see, but which weighed,
oh! so heavily on my soul.
I looked at my house and waited. How long it was! I already began
to think that the fire had gone out of its own accord, or that He
had extinguished it, when one of the lower windows gave way under
the violence of the flames, and a long, soft, caressing sheet of
red flame mounted up the white wall, and kissed it as high as the
roof. The light fell on to the trees, the branches, and the
leaves, and a shiver of fear pervaded them also! The birds awoke;
a dog began to howl, and it seemed to me as if the day were
breaking! Almost immediately two other windows flew into
fragments, and I saw that the whole of the lower part of my house
was nothing but a terrible furnace. But a cry, a horrible,
shrill, heart-rending cry, a woman's cry, sounded through the
night, and two garret windows were opened! I had forgotten the
servants! I saw the terror-struck faces, and the frantic waving
of their arms!
Then, overwhelmed with horror, I ran off to the village,
shouting: "Help! help! fire! fire!" Meeting some people who were
already coming on to the scene, I went back with them to see!
By this time the house was nothing but a horrible and magnificent
funeral pile, a monstrous pyre which lit up the whole country, a
pyre where men were burning, and where He was burning also, He,
He, my prisoner, that new Being, the new Master, the Horla!
Suddenly the whole roof fell in between the walls, and a volcano
of flames darted up to the sky. Through all the windows which
opened on to that furnace, I saw the flames darting, and I
reflected that He was there, in that kiln, dead.
Dead? Perhaps? His body? Was not his body, which was transparent,
indestructible by such means as would kill ours?
If He were not dead? Perhaps time alone has power over that
Invisible and Redoubtable Being. Why this transparent,
unrecognizable body, this body belonging to a spirit, if it also
had to fear ills, infirmities, and premature destruction?
Premature destruction? All human terror springs from that! After
man the Horla. After him who can die every day, at any hour, at
any moment, by any accident, He came, He who was only to die at
his own proper hour and minute, because He had touched the limits
of his existence!
No--no--there is no doubt about it--He is not dead. Then--then--I
suppose I must kill MYSELF!
MISS HARRIET
There were seven of us in a four-in-hand, four women and three
men, one of whom was on the box seat beside the coachman. We were
following, at a foot pace, broad highway which serpentines along
the coast.
Setting out from Etretat at break of day, in order to visit the
ruins of Tancarville, we were still asleep, chilled by the fresh
air of the morning. The women, especially, who were but little
accustomed to these early excursions, let their eyelids fall and
rise every moment, nodding their heads or yawning, quite
insensible to the glory of the dawn.
It was autumn. On both sides of the road the bare fields
stretched out, yellowed by the corn and wheat stubble which
covered the soil like a bristling growth of beard. The spongy
earth seemed to smoke. Larks were singing high up in the air,
while other birds piped in the bushes.
At length the sun rose in front of us, a bright red on the plane
of the horizon; and as it ascended, growing clearer from minute
to minute, the country seemed to awake, to smile, to shake and
stretch itself, like a young girl who is leaving her bed in her
white airy chemise. The Count d'Etraille, who was seated on the
box, cried:
"Look! look! a hare!" and he pointed toward the left, indicating
a piece of hedge. The leveret threaded its way along, almost
concealed by the field, only its large ears visible. Then it
swerved across a deep rut, stopped, again pursued its easy
course, changed its direction, stopped anew, disturbed, spying
out every danger, and undecided as to the route it should take.
Suddenly it began to run, with great bounds from its hind legs,
disappearing finally in a large patch of beet-root. All the men
had woke up to watch the course of the beast.
Rene Lemanoir then exclaimed
"We are not at all gallant this morning," and looking at his
neighbor, the little Baroness of Serennes, who was struggling
with drowsiness, he said to her in a subdued voice: "You are
thinking of your husband, Baroness. Reassure yourself; he will
not return before Saturday, so you have still four days."
She responded to him with a sleepy smile.
"How rude you are." Then, shaking off her torpor, she added:
"Now, let somebody say something that will make us all laugh.
You, Monsieur Chenal who have the reputation of possessing a
larger fortune than the Duke of Richelieu, tell us a love story
in which you have been mixed up, anything you like."
Leon Chenal, an old painter, who had once keen very handsome,
very strong, who was very proud of his physique and very amiable,
took his long white beard in his hand and smiled; then, after a
few moments' reflection, he became suddenly grave.
"Ladies, it will not be an amusing tale; for I am going to relate
to you the most lamentable love affair of my life, and I
sincerely hope that none of my friends has ever passed through a
similar experience.
I.
"At that time I was twenty-five years old, and was making daubs
along the coast of Normandy. I call 'making daubs' that wandering
about, with a bag on one's back, from mountain to mountain, under
the pretext of studying and of sketching nature. I know nothing
more enjoyable than that happy-go-lucky wandering life, in which
you are perfectly free; without shackles of any kind, without
care, without preoccupation, without thought even of to-morrow.
You go in any direction you please, without any guide save your
fancy, without any counselor save your eyes. You pull up, because
a running brook seduces you, or because you are attracted, in
front of an inn, by the smell of potatoes frying. Sometimes it is
the perfume of clematis which decides you in your choice, or the
naive glance of the servant at an inn. Do not despise me for my
affection for these rustics. These girls have soul as well as
feeling, not to mention firm cheeks and fresh lips; while their
hearty and willing kisses have the flavor of wild fruit. Love
always has its price, come whence it may. A heart that beats when
you make your appearance, an eye that weeps when you go away,
these are things so rare, so sweet, so precious, that they must
never be despised.
"I have had rendezvous in ditches in which cattle repose, and in
barns among the straw, still steaming from the heat of the day. I
have recollections of canvas spread on rude and creaky benches,
and of hearty, fresh, free kisses, more delicate, free from
affectation, and sincere than the subtle attractions of charming
and distinguished women.
"But what you love most amid all these varied adventures are the
country, the woods, the risings of the sun, the twilight, the
light of the moon. For the painter these are honeymoon trips with
Nature. You are alone with her in that long and tranquil
rendezvous. You go to bed in the fields amid marguerites and wild
poppies, and, with eyes wide open, you watch the going down of
the sun, and descry in the distance the little village, with its
pointed clock-tower, which sounds the hour of midnight.
"You sit down by the side of a spring which gushes out from the
foot of an oak, amid a covering of fragile herbs, growing and
redolent of life. You go down on your knees, bend forward, and
drink the cold and pellucid water, wetting your mustache and
nose; you drink it with a physical pleasure, as though you were
kissing the spring, lip to lip. Sometimes, when you encounter a
deep hole, along the course of these tiny brooks, you plunge into
it, quite naked, and on your skin, from head to foot, like an icy
and delicious caress, you feel the lovely and gentle quivering of
the current.
"You are gay on the hills, melancholy on the verge of pools,
exalted when the sun is crowned in an ocean of blood-red shadows,
and when it casts on the rivers its red reflection. And at night,
under the moon, as it passes across the vault of heaven, you
think of things, singular things, which would never have occurred
to your mind under the brilliant light of day.
"So, in wandering through the same country we are in this year, I
came to the little village of Benouville, on the Falaise, between
Yport and Etretat. I came from Fecamp, following the coast, a
high coast, perpendicular as a wall, with projecting and rugged
rocks falling sheer down into the sea. I had walked since the
morning on the close clipped grass, as smooth and as yielding as
a carpet. Singing lustily, I walked with long strides, looking
sometimes at the slow and lazy flight of a gull, with its short,
white wings, sailing in the blue heavens, sometimes at the green
sea, or at the brown sails of a fishing bark. In short, I had
passed a happy day, a day of listlessness and of liberty.
"I was shown a little farmhouse, where travelers were put up, a
kind of inn, kept by a peasant, which stood in the center of a
Norman court, surrounded by a double row of beeches.
"Quitting the Falaise. I gained the hamlet, which was hemmed in
by great trees, and I presented myself at the house of Mother
Lecacheur.
"She was an old, wrinkled, and austere rustic, who always seemed
to yield to the pressure of new customs with a kind of contempt.
"It was the month of May: the spreading apple-trees covered the
court with a whirling shower of blossoms which rained unceasingly
both upon people and upon the grass.
"I said:
" 'Well, Madame Lecacheur, have you a room for me?'
"Astonished to find that I knew her name, she answered:
" 'That depends; everything is let; but, all the same, there will
be no harm in looking.'
"In five minutes we were in perfect accord, and I deposited my
bag upon the bare floor of a rustic room, furnished with a bed,
two chairs, a table, and a washstand. The room opened into the
large and smoky kitchen, where the lodgers took their meals with
the people of the farm and with the farmer himself, who was a
widower.
"I washed my hands, after which I went out. The old woman was
fricasseeing a chicken for dinner in a large fireplace, in which
hung the stew-pot, black with smoke.
" 'You have travelers, then, at the present time?' said I to her.
"She answered in an offended tone of voice:
" 'I have a lady, an English lady, who has attained to years of
maturity. She is occupying my other room.'
"By means of an extra five sous a day, I obtained the privilege
of dining out in the court when the weather was fine.
"My cover was then placed in front of the door, and I commenced
to gnaw with hunger the lean members of the Normandy chicken, to
drink the clear cider, and to munch the hunk of white bread,
which, though four days old, was excellent.
"Suddenly, the wooden barrier which opened on to the highway was
opened, and a strange person directed her steps toward the house.
She was very slender, very tall, enveloped in a Scotch shawl with
red borders. You would have believed that she had no arms, if you
had not seen a long hand appear just above the hips, holding a
white tourist umbrella. The face of a mummy, surrounded with
sausage rolls of plaited gray hair, which bounded at every step
she took, made me think, I know not why, of a sour herring
adorned with curling papers. Lowering her eyes, she passed
quickly in front of me, and entered the house.
"This singular apparition made me curious. She undoubtedly was my
neighbor, the aged English lady of whom our hostess had spoken.
"I did not see her again that day. The next day, when I had begun
to paint at the end of that beautiful valley, which you know
extends as far as Etretat, lifting my eyes suddenly, I perceived
something singularly attired standing on the crest of the
declivity; it looked like a pole decked out with flags. It was
she. On seeing me, she suddenly disappeared. I re-entered the
house at midday for lunch, and took my seat at the common table,
so as to make the acquaintance of this old and original creature.
But she did not respond to my polite advances, was insensible
even to my little attentions. I poured water out for her with
great alacrity, I passed her the dishes with great eagerness. A
slight, almost imperceptible movement of the head, and an English
word, murmured so low that I did not understand it, were her
only acknowledgments.
"I ceased occupying myself with her, although she had disturbed
my thoughts. At the end of three days, I knew as much about her
as did Madame Lecacheur herself.
"She was called Miss Harriet. Seeking out a secluded village in
which to pass the summer, she had been attracted to Benouville,
some six months before, and did not seem disposed to quit it. She
never spoke at table, ate rapidly, reading all the while a small
book, treating of some Protestant propaganda. She gave a copy of
it to everybody. The cure himself had received no less than four
copies, at the hands of an urchin to whom she had paid two sous'
commission. She said sometimes to our hostess, abruptly, without
preparing herin the least for the declaration:
" 'I love the Saviour more than all; I worship him in all
creation; I adore him in all nature; I carry him always in my
heart.'
"And she would immediately present the old woman with one of her
brochures which were destined to convert the universe.
"In the village she was not liked. In fact, the schoolmaster had
declared that she was an atheist, and that a sort of reproach
attached to her. The cure, who had been consulted by Madame
Lecacheur, responded:
" 'She is a heretic, but God does not wish the death of the
sinner, and I believe her to be a person of pure morals.'
"These words, 'atheist,' 'heretic,' words which no one can
precisely define, threw doubts into some minds. It was asserted,
however, that this English-woman was rich, and that she had
passed her life in traveling through every country in the world,
because her family had thrown her off. Why had her family thrown
her off? Because of her natural impiety?
"She was, in fact, one of those people of exalted principles, one
of those opinionated puritans of whom England produces so many,
one of those good and insupportable old women who haunt the
tables d'hote of every hotel in Europe, who spoil Italy, poison
Switzerland, render the charming cities of the Mediterranean
uninhabitable, carry everywhere their fantastic manias, their
petrified vestal manners, their indescribable toilettes, and a
certain odor of india-rubber, which makes one believe that at
night they slip themselves into a case of that material. When I
meet one of these people in a hotel, I act like birds which see a
manikin in a field.
"This woman, however, appeared so singular that she did not
displease me.
"Madame Lecacheur, hostile by instinct to everything that was not
rustic, felt in her narrow soul a kind of hatred for the ecstatic
extravagances of the old girl. She had found a phrase by which to
describe her, I know not how, but a phrase assuredly
contemptuous, which had sprung to her lips, invented probably by
some confused and mysterious travail of soul. She said: 'That
woman is a demoniac.' This phrase, as uttered by that austere and
sentimental creature, seemed to me irresistibly comic. I, myself,
never called her now anything else but 'the demoniac.' feeling a
singular pleasure in pronouncing this word on seeing her.
"I would ask Mother Lecacheur: 'Well, what is our demoniac about
to-day?' To which my rustic friend would respond, with an air of
having been scandalized:
" 'What do you think, sir? She has picked up a toad which has had
its leg battered, and carried it to her room, and has put it in
her washstand, and dressed it up like a man. If that is not
profanation, I should like to know what is!'
"On another occasion, when walking along the Falaise, she had
bought a large fish which had just been caught, simply to throw
it back into the sea again. The sailor, from whom she had bought
it, though paid handsomely, was greatly provoked at this
act--more exasperated, indeed, than if she had put her hand into
his pocket and taken his money. For a whole month he could not
speak of the circumstance without getting into a fury and
denouncing it as an outrage. Oh yes! She was indeed a demoniac,
this Miss Harriet, and Mother Lecacheur must have had an
inspiration of genius in thus christening her.
"The stable-boy, who was called Sapeur, because he had served in
Africa in his youth, entertained other aversions. He said, with a
roguish air: 'She is an old hag who has lived her days.' If the
poor woman had but known!
"Little kind-hearted Celeste did not wait upon her willingly, but
I was never able to understand why. Probably her only reason was
that she was a stranger, of another race, of a different tongue,
and of another religion. She was in good truth a demoniac!
"She passed her time wandering about the country, adoring and
searching for God in nature. I found her one evening on her knees
in a cluster of bushes. Having discovered something red through
the leaves, I brushed aside the branches, and Miss Harriet at
once rose to her feet, confused at having been found thus,
looking at me with eyes as terrible as those of a wild cat
surprised in open day.
"Sometimes, when I was working among the rocks, I would suddenly
descry her on the banks of the Falaise standing like a semaphore
signal. She gazed passionately at the vast sea, glittering in the
sunlight, and the boundless sky empurpled with fire. Sometimes I
would distinguish her at the bottom of a valley, walking quickly,
with her elastic English step; and I would go toward her,
attracted by I know not what, simply to see her illuminated
visage, her dried-up features, which seemed to glow with an
ineffable, inward, and profound happiness.
"Often I would encounter her in the corner of a field sitting on
the grass, under the shadow of an apple-tree, with her little
Bible lying open on her knee, while she looked meditatively into
the distance.
"I could no longer tear myself away from that quiet country
neighborhood, bound to it as I was by a thousand links of love
for its soft and sweeping landscapes. At this farm I was out of
the world, far removed from everything, but in close proximity to
the soil, the good, healthy, beautiful green soil. And, must I
avow it, there was something besides curiosity which retained me
at the residence of Mother Lecacheur. I wished to become
acquainted a little with this strange Miss Harriet, and to learn
what passes in the solitary souls of those wandering old, English
dames.
II.
"We became acquainted in a rather singular manner. I had just
finished a study which appeared to me to display genius and
power; as it must have, since it was sold for ten thousand
francs, fifteen years later. It was as simple, however, as that
two and two make four, and had nothing to do with academic rules.
The whole of the right side of my canvas represented a rock, an
enormous rock, covered with sea-wrack, brown, yellow, and red,
across which the sun poured like a stream of oil. The light,
without which one could see the stars concealed in the
background, fell upon the stone, and gilded it as if with fire.
That was all. A first stupid attempt at dealing with light, with
burning rays, with the sublime.
"On the left was the sea, not the blue sea, the slate-colored
sea, but a sea of jade, as greenish, milky, and thick as the
overcast sky.
"I was so pleased with my work that I danced from sheer delight
as I carried it back to the inn. I wished that the whole world
could have seen it at one and the same moment. I can remember
that I showed it to a cow, which was browsing by the wayside,
exclaiming, at the same time: 'Look at that, my old beauty; you
will not often see its like again.'
"When I had reached the front of the house, I immediately called
out to Mother Lecacheur, shouting with all my might:
" 'Ohe! Ohe! my mistress, come here and look at this.'
"The rustic advanced and looked at my work with stupid eyes,
which distinguished nothing, and did not even recognize whether
the picture was the representation of an ox or a house.
"Miss Harriet came into the house, and passed in rear of me just
at the moment when, holding out my canvas at arm's length, I was
exhibiting it to the female innkeeper. The 'demoniac' could not
help but see it, for I took care to exhibit the thing in such a
way that it could not escape her notice. She stopped abruptly and
stood motionless, stupefied. It was her rock which was depicted,
the one which she usually climbed to dream away her time
undisturbed.
"She uttered a British 'Oh,' which was at once so accentuated and
so flattering, that I turned round to her, smiling, and said:
"This is my last work, Mademoiselle.'
"She murmured ecstatically, comically, and tenderly:
" 'Oh! Monsieur, you must understand what it is to have a
palpitation.'
"I colored up, of course, and was more excited by that compliment
than if it had come from a queen. I was seduced, conquered,
vanquished. I could have embraced her--upon my honor.
"I took my seat at the table beside her, as I had always done.
For the first time, she spoke, drawling out in a loud voice:
" 'Oh! I love nature so much.'
"I offered her some bread, some water, some wine. She now
accepted these with the vacant smile of a mummy. I then began to
converse with her about the scenery.
"After the meal, we rose from the table together and walked
leisurely across the court; then, attracted by the fiery glow
which the setting sun cast over the surface of the sea, I opened
the outside gate which faced in the direction of the Falaise, and
we walked on side by side, as satisfied as any two persons could
be who have just learned to understand and penetrate each other's
motives and feelings.
"It was a misty, relaxing evening, one of those enjoyable
evenings which impart happiness to mind and body alike. All is
joy, all is charm. The luscious and balmy air, loaded with the
perfumes of herbs, with the perfumes of grass-wrack, with the
odor of the wild flowers, caresses the soul with a penetrating
sweetness. We were going to the brink of the abyss which
overlooked the vast sea and rolled past us at the distance of
less than a hundred meters.
"We drank with open mouth and expanded chest, that fresh breeze
from the ocean which glides slowly over the skin, salted as it is
by long contact with the waves.
"Wrapped up in her square shawl, inspired by the balmy air and
with teeth firmly set, the English-woman gazed fixedly at the
great sun-ball, as it descended toward the sea. Soon its rim
touched the waters, just in rear of a ship which had appeared on
the horizon, until, by degrees, it was swallowed up by the ocean.
We watched it plunge, diminish, and finally disappear.
"Miss Harriet contemplated with passionate regard the last
glimmer of the flaming orb of day.
"She muttered: 'Oh! I love--I love--' I saw a tear start in her
eye. She continued: 'I wish I were a little bird, so that I could
mount up into the firmament.'
"She remained standing as I had often before seen her, perched on
the river bank, her face as red as her flaming shawl. I should
have liked to have sketched her in my album. It would have been
an ecstatic caricature. I turned my face away from her so as to
be able to laugh.
"I then spoke to her of painting, as I would have done to a
fellow-artist, using the technical terms common among the
devotees of the profession. She listened attentively to me,
eagerly seeking to divine the sense of the obscure words, so as
to penetrate my thoughts. From time to time, she would exclaim:
'Oh! I understand, I understand. This is very interesting.' We
returned home.
"The next day, on seeing me, she approached me eagerly, holding
out her hand; and we became firm friends immediately.
"She was a brave creature, with an elastic sort of a soul, which
became enthusiastic at a bound. She lacked equilibrium, like all
women who are spinsters at the age of fifty. She seemed to be
pickled in vinegary innocence, though her heart still retained
something of youth and of girlish effervescence. She loved both
nature and animals with a fervent ardor, a love like old wine,
mellow through age, with a sensual love that she had never
bestowed on men.
"One thing is certain: a mare roaming in a meadow with a foal at
its side, a bird's nest full of young ones, squeaking, with their
open mouths and enormous heads, made her quiver with the most
violent emotion.
"Poor solitary beings! Sad wanderers from table d'hote to table
d'hote, poor beings, ridiculous and lamentable, I love you ever
since I became acquainted with Miss Harriet!
"I soon discovered that she had something she would like to tell
me, but dared not, and I was amused at her timidity. When I
started out in the morning with my box on my back, she would
accompany me as far as the end of the village, silent, but
evidently struggling inwardly to find words with which to begin a
conversation. Then she would leave me abruptly, and, with jaunty
step, walk away quickly.
"One day, however, she plucked up courage:
" 'I would like to see how you paint pictures? Will you show me?
I have been very curious.'
"And she colored up as though she had given utterance to words
extremely audacious.
"I conducted her to the bottom of the Petit-Val, where I had
commenced a large picture.
"She remained standing near me, following all my gestures with
concentrated attention. Then, suddenly, fearing, perhaps, that
she was disturbing me, she said to me: 'Thank you,' and walked
away.
"But in a short time she became more familiar, and accompanied me
every day, her countenance exhibiting visible pleasure. She
carried her folding stool under her arm; would not consent to my
carrying it, and she sat always by my side. She would remain
there for hours immovable and mute, following with her eye the
point of my brush in its every movement. When I would obtain, by
a large splatch of color spread on with a knife, a striking and
unexpected effect, she would, in spite of herself, give vent to a
half-suppressed 'Oh!' of astonishment, of joy, of admiration. She
had the most tender respect for my canvases, an almost religious
respect for that human reproduction of a part of nature's work
divine. My studies appeared to her to be pictures of sanctity,
and sometimes she spoke to me of God, with the idea of converting
me.
"Oh! He was a queer good-natured being, this God of hers. He was
a sort of village philosopher without any great resources, and
without great power; for she always figured him to herself as a
being quivering over injustices committed under his eyes, and
helpless to prevent them.
"She was, however, on excellent terms with him, affecting even to
be the confidant of his secrets and of his whims. She said:
" 'God wills, or God does not will,' just like a sergeant
announcing to a recruit: 'The colonel has commanded.'
"At the bottom of her heart she deplored my ignorance of the
intentions of the Eternal, which she strove, nay, felt herself
compelled, to impart to me.
"Almost every day, I found in my pockets, in my hat when I lifted
it from the ground, in my box of colors, in my polished shoes,
standing in the mornings in front of my door, those little pious
brochures, which she, no doubt, received directly from Paradise.
"I treated her as one would an old friend, with unaffected
cordiality. But I soon perceived that she had changed somewhat in
her manner; but, for a while, I paid little attention to it.
"When I walked about, whether to the bottom of the valley, or
through some country lanes, I would see her suddenly appear, as
though she were returning from a rapid walk. She would then sit
down abruptly, out of breath, as though she had been running or
overcome by some profound emotion. Her face would be red, that
English red which is denied to the people of all other countries;
then, without any reason, she would grow pale, become the color
of the ground, and seem ready to faint away. Gradually, however,
I would see her regain her ordinary color, whereupon she would
begin to speak.
"Then, without warning, she would break off in the middle of a
sentence, spring up from her seat, and march off so rapidly and
so strangely, that it would, sometimes, put me to my wits' end to
try and discover whether I had done or said anything to displease
or offend her.
"I finally came to the conclusion that this arose from her early
habits and training, somewhat modified, no doubt, in honor of me,
since the first days of our acquaintanceship.
"When she returned to the farm, after walking for hours on the
wind-beaten coast, her long curled hair would be shaken out and
hanging loose, as though it had broken away from its bearings. It
was seldom that this gave her any concern; though sometimes she
looked as though she had been dining sans ceremonie; her locks
having become disheveled by the breezes.
"She would then go up to her room in order to adjust what I
called her glass lamps. When I would say to her, in familiar
gallantry, which, however, always offended her:
" 'You are as beautiful as a planet to-day, Miss Harriet,' a
little blood would immediately mount into her cheeks, the blood
of a young maiden, the blood of sweet fifteen.
"Then she would become abruptly savage and cease coming to watch
me paint. But I always thought:
" 'This is only a fit of temper she is passing through.'
"But it did not always pass away. When I spoke to her sometimes,
she would answer me, either with an air of affected indifference,
or in sullen anger; and she became by turns rude, impatient, and
nervous. For a time I never saw her except at meals, and we spoke
but little. I concluded, at length, that I must have offended her
in something: and, accordingly, I said to her one evening:
" 'Miss Harriet, why is it that you do not act toward me as
formerly? What have I done to displease you? You are causing me
much pain!'
"She responded, in an angry tone, in a manner altogether sui
generis:
" 'I am always with you the same as formerly. It is not true, not
true,' and she ran upstairs and shut herself up in her room.
"At times she would look upon me with strange eyes. Since that
time I have often said to myself that those condemned to death
must look thus when informed that their last day has come. In her
eye there lurked a species of folly, a folly at once mysterious
and violent--even more, a fever, an exasperated desire,
impatient, at once incapable of being realized and unrealizable!
"Nay, it seemed to me that there was also going on within her a
combat, in which her heart struggled against an unknown force
that she wished to overcome--perhaps, even, something else. But
what could I know? What could I know?
III.
"This was indeed a singular revelation.
"For some time I had commenced to work, as soon as daylight
appeared, on a picture, the subject of which was as follows:
"A deep ravine, steep banks dominated by two declivities, lined
with brambles and long rows of trees, hidden, drowned in milky
vapor, clad in that misty robe which sometimes floats over
valleys at break of day. At the extreme end of that thick and
transparent fog, you see coming, or rather already come, a human
couple, a stripling and a maiden embraced, interlaced, she, with
head leaning on him, he; inclined toward hers and lip to lip.
"A ray of the sun, glistening through the branches, has traversed
the fog of dawn and illuminated it with a rosy reflection, just
behind the rustic lovers, whose vague shadows are reflected on it
in clear silver. It was well done, yes, indeed, well done.
"I was working on the declivity which led to the Val d'Etretat.
This particular morning, I had, by chance, the sort of floating
vapor which was necessary for my purpose. Suddenly, an object
appeared in front of me, a kind of phantom; it was Miss Harriet.
On seeing me, she took to flight. But I called after her saying:
'Come here, come here, Mademoiselle, I have a nice little picture
for you.'
"She came forward, though with seeming reluctance. I handed her
my sketch. She said nothing, but stood for a long time
motionless, looking at it. Suddenly she burst into tears. She
wept spasmodically, like men who have been struggling hard
against shedding tears, but who can do so no longer, and abandon
themselves to grief, though unwillingly. I got up, trembling,
moved myself by the sight of a sorrow I did not comprehend, and I
took her by the hand with a gesture of brusque affection, a true
French impulse which impels one quicker than one thinks.
"She let her hands rest in mine for a few seconds, and I felt
them quiver, as if her whole nervous system was twisting and
turning. Then she withdrew her hands abruptly, or, rather, tore
them out of mine.
"I recognized that shiver as soon as I had felt it: I was
deceived in nothing. Ah! the love shudder of a woman, whether she
is fifteen or fifty years of age, whether she is one of the
people or one of the monde, goes so straight to my heart that I
never had any difficulty in understanding it!
"Her whole frail being trembled, vibrated, yielded. I knew it.
She walked away before I had time to say a word, leaving me as
surprised as if I had witnessed a miracle, and as troubled as if
I had committed a crime.
"I did not go in to breakfast. I took a walk on the banks of the
Falaise, feeling that I could just as soon weep as laugh, looking
on the adventure as both comic and deplorable, and my position as
ridiculous, fain to believe that I had lost my head.
"I asked myself what I ought to do. I debated whether I ought not
to take my leave of the place and almost immediately my
resolution was formed.
"Somewhat sad and perplexed, I wandered about until dinner time,
and entered the farmhouse just when the soup had been served up.
"I sat down at the table, as usual. Miss Harriet was there,
munching away solemnly, without speaking to anyone, without even
lifting her eyes. She wore, however, her usual expression, both
of countenance and manner.
"I waited, patiently, till the meal had been finished. Then,
turning toward the landlady, I said: 'Madame Lecacheur, it will
not be long now before I shall have to take my leave of you.'
"The good woman, at once surprised and troubled, replied in a
quivering voice: 'My dear sir, what is it I have just heard you
say? Are you going to leave us, after I have become so much
accustomed to you?'
"I looked at Miss Harriet from the corner of my eye. Her
countenance did not change in the least; but the under-servant
came toward me with eyes wide open. She was a fat girl, of about
eighteen years of age, rosy, fresh, strong as a horse, yet
possessing a rare attribute in one in her position--she was very
neat and clean. I had kissed her at odd times, in out of the way
corners, in the manner of a mountain guide, nothing more.
"The dinner being over, I went to smoke my pipe under the
apple-trees, walking up and down at my ease, from one end of the
court to the other. All the reflections which I had made during
the day, the strange discovery of the morning, that grotesque and
passionate attachment for me, the recollections which that
revelation had suddenly called up, recollections at once charming
and perplexing, perhaps, also, that look which the servant had
cast on me at the announcement of my departure--all these things,
mixed up and combined, put me now in an excited bodily state,
with the tickling sensation of kisses on my lips, and in my veins
something which urged me on to commit some folly.
"Night having come on, casting its dark shadows under the trees,
I descried Celeste, who had gone to shut the hen-coops, at the
other end of the inclosure. I darted toward her, running so
noiselessly that she heard nothing, and as she got up from
closing the small traps by which the chickens went in and out, I
clasped her in my arms and rained on her coarse, fat face a
shower of kisses. She made a struggle, laughing all the same, as
she was accustomed to do in such circumstances. What made me
suddenly loose my grip of her? Why did I at once experience a
shock? What was it that I heard behind me?
"It was Miss Harriet who had come upon us, who had seen us, and
who stood in front of us, as motionless as a specter. Then she
disappeared in the darkness.
"I was ashamed, embarrassed, more annoyed at having been
surprised by her than if she had caught me committing some
criminal act.
"I slept badly that night; I was worried and haunted by sad
thoughts. I seemed to hear loud weeping; but in this I was no
doubt deceived. Moreover, I thought several times that I heard
some one walking up and down in the house, and that some one
opened my door from the outside.
"Toward morning, I was overcome by fatigue, and sleep seized on
me. I got up late and did not go downstairs until breakfast time,
being still in a bewildered state, not knowing what kind of face
to put on.
"No one had seen Miss Harriet. We waited for her at table, but
she did not appear. At length, Mother Lecacheur went to her room.
The English-woman had gone out. She must have set out at break of
day, as she was wont to do, in order to see the sun rise.
"Nobody seemed astonished at this and we began to eat in silence.
"The weather was hot, very hot, one of those still sultry days
when not a leaf stirs. The table had been placed out of doors,
under an apple-tree; and from time to time Sapeur had gone to the
cellar to draw a jug of cider, everybody was so thirsty. Celeste
brought the dishes from the kitchen, a ragout of mutton with
potatoes, a cold rabbit, and a salad. Afterward she placed before
us a dish of strawberries, the first of the season.
"As I wanted to wash and freshen these, I begged the servant to
go and bring a pitcher of cold water."
"In about five minutes she returned, declaring that the well was
dry. She had lowered the pitcher to the full extent of the cord,
and had touched the bottom, but on drawing the pitcher up again,
it was empty. Mother Lecacheur, anxious to examine the thing for
herself, went and looked down the hole. She returned announcing
that one could see clearly something in the well, something
altogether unusual. But this, no doubt, was pottles of straw,
which, out of spite, had been cast down it by a neighbor.
"I wished also to look down the well, hoping to clear up the
mystery, and perched myself close to its brink. I perceived,
indistinctly, a white object. What could it be? I then conceived
the idea of lowering a lantern at the end of a cord. When I did
so, the yellow flame danced on the layers of stone and gradually
became clearer. All four of us were leaning over the opening,
Sapeur and Celeste having now joined us. The lantern rested on a
black and white, indistinct mass, singular, incomprehensible.
Sapeur exclaimed:
" 'It is a horse. I see the hoofs. It must have escaped from the
meadow, during the night, and fallen in headlong.'
"But, suddenly, a cold shiver attacked my spine, I first
recognized a foot, then a clothed limb; the body was entire, but
the other limb had disappeared under the water.
"I groaned and trembled so violently that the light of the lamp
danced hither and thither over the object, discovering a slipper.
" 'It is a woman! who--who--can it be? It is Miss Harriet.'
"Sapeur alone did not manifest horror. He had witnessed many such
scenes in Africa.
"Mother Lecacheur and Celeste began to scream and to shriek, and
ran away.
"But it was necessary to recover the corpse of the dead. I
attached the boy securely by the loins to the end of the
pulley-rope; then I lowered him slowly, and watched him disappear
in the darkness. In the one hand he had a lantern, and held on to
the rope with the other. Soon I recognized his voice, which
seemed to come from the center of the earth, crying:
" 'Stop.'
"I then saw him fish something out of the water. It was the other
limb. He bound the two feet together, and shouted anew:
" 'Haul up.'
"I commenced to wind him up, but I felt my arms strain, my
muscles twitch, and was in terror lest I should let the boy fall
to the bottom. When his head appeared over the brink, I asked:
" 'What is it?' as though I only expected that he would tell me
what he had discovered at the bottom.
"We both got on to the stone slab at the edge of the well, and,
face to face, hoisted the body.
"Mother Lecacheur and Celeste watched us from a distance,
concealed behind the wall of the house. When they saw, issuing
from the well, the black slippers and white stockings of the
drowned person, they disappeared.
"Sapeur seized the ankles of the poor chaste woman, and we drew
it up, inclined, as it was, in the most immodest posture. The
head was in a shocking state, bruised and black; and the long,
gray hair, hanging down, was tangled and disordered.
" 'In the name of all that is holy, how lean she is!' exclaimed
Sapeur, in a contemptuous tone.
"We carried her into the room, and as the women did not put in an
appearance, I, with the assistance of the lad, dressed the corpse
for burial.
"I washed her disfigured face. By the touch of my hand an eye was
slightly opened; it seemed to scan me with that pale stare, with
that cold, that terrible look which corpses have, a look which
seems to come from the beyond. I plaited up, as well as I could,
her disheveled hair, and I adjusted on her forehead a novel and
singularly formed lock. Then I took off her dripping wet
garments, baring, not without a feeling of shame, as though I had
been guilty of some profanation, her shoulders and her chest, and
her long arms, slim as the twigs of branches.
"I next went to fetch some flowers, corn poppies, blue beetles,
marguerites, and fresh and perfumed herbs, with which to strew
her funeral couch.
"Being the only person near her, it was necessary for me to
perform the usual ceremonies. In a letter found in her pocket,
written at the last moment, she asked that her body be buried in
the village in which she had passed the last days of her life. A
frightful thought then oppressed my heart. Was it not on my
account that she wished to be laid at rest in this place?
"Toward the evening, all the female gossips of the locality came
to view the remains of the defunct; but I would not allow a
single person to enter; I wanted to be alone; and I watched by
the corpse the whole night.
"By the flickering light of the candles, I looked at the body of
this miserable woman, wholly unknown, who had died so lamentably
and so far away from home. Had she left no friends, no relatives
behind her? What had her infancy been? What had been her life?
Whence had she come thither, all alone, a wanderer, like a dog
driven from home? What secrets of suffering and of despair were
sealed up in that disagreeable body, in that spent and withered
body, that impenetrable hiding place of a mystery which had
driven her far away from affection and from love?
"How many unhappy beings there are! I felt that upon that human
creature weighed the eternal injustice of implacable nature! Life
was over with her, without her ever having experienced, perhaps,
that which sustains the most miserable of us all--to wit, the
hope of being once loved! Otherwise, why should she thus have
concealed herself, have fled from the face of others? Why did she
love everything so tenderly and so passionately, everything
living that was not a man?
"I recognized, also, that she believed in a God, and that she
hoped for compensation from him for the miseries she had endured.
She had now begun to decompose, and to become, in turn, a plant.
She who had blossomed in the sun was now to be eaten up by the
cattle, carried away in herbs, and in the flesh of beasts, again
to become human flesh. But that which is called the soul had been
extinguished at the bottom of the dark well. She suffered no
longer. She had changed her life for that of others yet to be
born.
"Hours passed away in this silent and sinister communion with the
dead. A pale light at length announced the dawn of a new day, and
a bright ray glistened on the bed, shedding a dash of fire on the
bedclothes and on her hands. This was the hour she had so much
loved, when the waking birds began to sing in the trees.
"I opened the window to its fullest extent, I drew back the
curtains, so that the whole heavens might look in upon us. Then
bending toward the glassy corpse, I took in my hands the
mutilated head, and slowly, without terror or disgust, imprinted
a long, long kiss upon those lips which had never before received
the salute of love."
 *  *  *  *  *  *  *
Leon Chenal remained silent. The women wept. We heard on the box
seat Count d'Etraille blow his nose, from time to time. The
coachman alone had gone to sleep. The horses, which felt no
longer the sting of the whip, had slackened their pace and
dragged softly along. And the four-in-hand, hardly moving at all,
became suddenly torpid, as if laden with sorrow.
THE HOLE
CUTS AND WOUNDS WHICH CAUSED DEATH. That was the heading of the
charge which brought Leopold Renard, upholsterer, before the
Assize Court.
Round him were the principal witnesses, Madame Flameche, widow of
the victim, Louis Ladureau, cabinetmaker, and Jean Durdent,
plumber.
Near the criminal was his wife, dressed in black, a little ugly
woman, who looked like a monkey dressed as a lady.
This is how Renard described the drama:
"Good heavens, it is a misfortune of which I am the first and
last victim, and with which my will has nothing to do. The facts
are their own commentary, Monsieur le President. I am an honest
man, a hard-working man, an upholsterer in the same street for
the last sixteen years, known, liked, respected, and esteemed by
all, as my neighbors have testified, even the porter, who is not
folatre every day. I am fond of work, I am fond of saving, I like
honest men, and respectable pleasures. That is what has ruined
me, so much the worse for me; but as my will had nothing to do
with it, I continue to respect myself.
"Every Sunday for the last five years, my wife and I have spent
the day at Passy. We get fresh air, not to say that we are fond
of fishing--as fond of it as we are of small onions. Melie
inspired me with that passion, the jade; she is more enthusiastic
than I am, the scold, and all the mischief in this business is
her fault, as you will see immediately.
"I am strong and mild-tempered, without a pennyworth of malice in
me. But she! oh! la! la! she looks insignificant, she is short
and thin, but she does more mischief than a weasel. I do not deny
that she has some good qualities; she has some, and those very
important to a man in business. But her character! Just ask about
it in the neighborhood; even the porter's wife, who has just sent
me about my business--she will tell you something about it.
"Every day she used to find fault with my mild temper: 'I would
not put up with this! I would not put up with that.' If I had
listened to her, Monsieur le President, I should have had at
least three bouts of fisticuffs a month."
Madame Renard interrupted him: "And for good reasons too; they
laugh best who laugh last."
He turned toward her frankly: "Oh! very well, I can blame you,
since you were the cause of it."
Then, facing the President again he said:
"I will continue. We used to go to Passy every Saturday evening,
so as to be able to begin fishing at daybreak the next morning.
It is a habit which has become second nature with us, as the
saying is. Three years ago this summer I discovered a place, oh!
such a spot! There, in the shade, were eight feet of water at
least and perhaps ten, a hole with a retour under the bank, a
regular retreat for fish and a paradise for any fisherman. I
might look upon that hole as my property, Monsieur le President,
as I was its Christopher Columbus. Everybody in the neighborhood
knew it, without making any opposition. They used to say: 'That
is Renard's place'; and nobody would have gone to it, not even
Monsieur Plumsay, who is renowned, be it said without any
offense, for appropriating other people's places.
"Well, I went as usual to that place, of which I felt as certain
as if I had owned it. I had scarcely got there on Saturday, when
I got into 'Delila,' with my wife. 'Delila' is my Norwegian boat,
which I had built by Fourmaise, and which is light and safe.
Well, as I said, we got into the boat and we were going to bait,
and for baiting there is nobody to be compared with me, and they
all know it. You want to know with what I bait? I cannot answer
that question; it has nothing to do with the accident; I cannot
answer, that is my secret. There are more than three hundred
people who have asked me; I have been offered glasses of brandy
and liquors, fried fish, matelots,[1] to make me tell! But just
go and try whether the chub will come. Ah! they have patted my
stomach to get at my secret, my recipe. Only my wife knows, and
she will not tell it, any more than I shall! Is not that so,
Melie?"
[1] A preparation of several kinds of fish, with a sharp sauce.
The President of the Court interrupted him:
"Just get to the facts as soon as you can."
The accused continued: "I am getting to them; I am getting to
them. Well, on Saturday. July 8, we left by the five twenty-five
train, and before dinner we went to ground-bait as usual. The
weather promised to keep fine, and I said to Melie: 'All right
for to-morrow!' And she replied: 'It looks like it.' We never
talk more than that together.
"And then we returned to dinner. I was happy and thirsty, and
that was the cause of everything. I said to Melie: 'Look here
Melie, it is fine weather, so suppose I drink a bottle of Casque
a meche. That is a little white wine which we have christened so,
because if you drink too much of it it prevents you from sleeping
and is the opposite of a nightcap. Do you understand me?
"She replied: 'You can do as you please, but you will be ill
again, and will not be able to get up to-morrow.' That was true,
sensible, prudent, and clear-sighted, I must confess.
Nevertheless, I could not withstand it, and I drank my bottle. It
all comes from that.
"Well, I could not sleep. By Jove! It kept me awake till two
o'clock in the morning, and then I went to sleep so soundly that
I should not have heard the angel shouting at the Last Judgment.
"In short, my wife woke me at six o'clock and I jumped out of
bed, hastily put on my trousers and jersey, washed my face and
jumped on board 'Delila.' But it was too late, for when I arrived
at my hole it was already taken! Such a thing had never happened
to me in three years, and it made me feel as if I were being
robbed under my own eyes. I said to myself, Confound it all!
confound it! And then my wife began to nag at me. 'Eh! What about
your Casque a meche! Get along, you drunkard! Are you satisfied,
you great fool?' I could say nothing, because it was all quite
true, and so I landed all the same near the spot and tried to
profit by what was left. Perhaps after all the fellow might catch
nothing, and go away.
"He was a little thin man, in white linen coat and waistcoat, and
with a large straw hat, and his wife, a fat woman who was doing
embroidery, was behind him.
"When she saw us take up our position close to their place, she
murmured: 'I suppose there are no other places on the river!' And
my wife, who was furious, replied: 'People who know how to behave
make inquiries about the habits of the neighborhood before
occupying reserved spots.'
"As I did not want a fuss, I said to her: 'Hold your tongue,
Melie. Let them go on, let them go on; we shall see.'
"Well, we had fastened 'Delila' under the willow-trees, and had
landed and were fishing side by side, Melie and I, close to the
two others; but here, Monsieur, I must enter into details.
"We had only been there about five minutes when our male
neighbor's float began to go down two or three times, and then he
pulled out a chub as thick as my thigh, rather less, perhaps, but
nearly as big! My heart beat, and the perspiration stood on my
forehead, and Melie said to me: 'Well, you sot, did you see
that?'
"Just then, Monsieur Bru, the grocer of Poissy, who was fond of
gudgeon fishing, passed in a boat, and called out to me: So
somebody has taken your usual place, Monsieur Renard? And I
replied: 'Yes, Monsieur Bru, there are some people in this world
who do not know the usages of common politeness.'
"The little man in linen pretended not to hear, nor his fat lump
of a wife, either.
Here the President interrupted him a second time: "Take care, you
are insulting the widow, Madame Flameche, who is present.
Renard made his excuses: "I beg your pardon, I beg your pardon,
my anger carried me away. Well, not a quarter of an hour had
passed when the little man caught another chub and another almost
immediately, and another five minutes later.
"The tears were in my eyes, and then I knew that Madame Renard
was boiling with rage, for she kept on nagging at me: 'Oh! how
horrid! Don't you see that he is robbing you of your fish? Do you
think that you will catch anything? Not even a frog, nothing
whatever. Why, my hands are burning, just to think of it.'
"But I said to myself: 'Let us wait until twelve o clock. Then
this poaching fellow will go to lunch, and I shall get my place
again. As for me, Monsieur le President, I lunch on the spot
every Sunday; we bring our provisions in 'Delila.' But there! At
twelve o'clock, the wretch produced a fowl out of a newspaper,
and while he was eating, actually he caught another chub!
"Melie and I had a morsel also, just a mouthful, a mere nothing,
for our heart was not in it.
"Then I took up my newspaper, to aid my digestion. Every Sunday I
read the 'Gil Blas' in the shade like that, by the side of the
water. It is Columbine's day, you know, Columbine who writes the
articles in the 'Gil Blas.' I generally put Madame Renard into a
passion by pretending to know this Columbine. It is not true, for
I do not know her, and have never seen her, but that does not
matter; she writes very well, and then she says things straight
out for a woman. She suits me, and there are not many of her
sort.
"Well, I began to tease my wife, but she got angry immediately,
and very angry, and so I held my tongue. At that moment our two
witnesses, who are present here, Monsieur Ladureau and Monsieur
Durdent, appeared on the other side of the river. We knew each
other by sight. The little man began to fish again, and he caught
so many that I trembled with vexation, and his wife said: 'It is
an uncommonly good spot, and we will come here always, Desire.'
As for me, a cold shiver ran down my back, and Madame Renard kept
repeating: 'You are not a man; you have the blood of a chicken in
your veins'; and suddenly I said to her: 'Look here, I would
rather go away, or I shall only be doing something foolish.'
"And she whispered to me as if she had put a red-hot iron under
my nose: 'You are not a man. Now you are going to run away, and
surrender your place! Off you go, Bazaine!'
"Well, I felt that, but yet I did not move, while the other
fellow pulled out a bream, Oh! I never saw such a large one
before, never! And then my wife began to talk aloud, as if she
were thinking, and you can see her trickery. She said: 'That is
what one might call stolen fish, seeing that we baited the place
ourselves. At any rate, they ought to give us back the money we
have spent on bait.'
"Then the fat woman in the cotton dress said in turn: 'Do you
mean to call us thieves, Madame?' And they began to explain, and
then they came to words. Oh! Lord! those creatures know some good
ones. They shouted so loud, that our two witnesses, who were on
the other bank, began to call out by way of a joke: 'Less noise
over there; you will prevent your husbands from fishing.'
"The fact is that neither of us moved any more than if we had
been two tree-stumps. We remained there, with our noses over the
water, as if we had heard nothing, but by Jove, we heard all the
same. 'You are a mere liar.'
" 'You are nothing better than a street-walker.'
" 'You are only a trollop.'
" 'You are a regular strumpet.'
"And so on, and so on; a sailor could not have said more.
"Suddenly I heard a noise behind me, and turned round. It was the
other one, the fat woman who had fallen on to my wife with her
parasol. WHACK! WHACK! Melie got two of them, but she was
furious, and she hits hard when she is in a rage, so she caught
the fat woman by the hair and then, THUMP, THUMP. Slaps in the
face rained down like ripe plums. I should have let them go
on--women among themselves, men among themselves--it does not do
to mix the blows, but the little man in the linen jacket jumped
up like a devil and was going to rush at my wife. Ah! no, no, not
that, my friend! I caught the gentleman with the end of my fist,
CRASH, CRASH, one on the nose, the other in the stomach. He threw
up his arms and legs and fell on his back into the river, just
into the hole.
"I should have fished him out most certainly, Monsieur le
President, if I had had the time. But unfortunately the fat woman
got the better of it, and she was drubbing Melie terribly. I know
that I ought not to have assisted her while the man was drinking
his fill, but I never thought that he would drown, and said to
myself: 'Bah, it will cool him.'
"I therefore ran up to the women to separate them, and all I
received was scratches and bites. Good Lord, what creatures!
Well, it took me five minutes, and perhaps ten, to separate those
two viragoes. When I turned round, there was nothing to be seen,
and the water was as smooth as a lake. The others yonder kept
shouting: 'Fish him out!' It was all very well to say that, but I
cannot swim and still less dive!
"At last the man from the dam came, and two gentlemen with
boat-hooks, but it had taken over a quarter of an hour. He was
found at the bottom of the hole in eight feet of water, as I have
said, but he was dead, the poor little man in his linen suit!
There are the facts, such as I have sworn to. I am innocent, on
my honor."
The witnesses having deposed to the same effect, the accused was
acquitted.
LOVE
THREE PAGES FROM A SPORTSMAN'S BOOK
I have just read among the general news in one of the papers a
drama of passion. He killed her and then he killed himself, so he
must have loved her. What matters He or She? Their love alone
matters to me; and it does not interest me because it moves me or
astonishes me, or because it softens me or makes me think, but
because it recalls to my mind a remembrance of my youth, a
strange recollection of a hunting adventure where Love appeared
to me, as the Cross appeared to the early Christians, in the
midst of the heavens.
I was born with all the instincts and the senses of primitive
man, tempered by the arguments and the restraints of a civilized
being. I am passionately fond of shooting, yet the sight of the
wounded animal, of the blood on its feathers and on my hands,
affects my heart so as almost to make it stop.
That year the cold weather set in suddenly toward the end of
autumn, and I was invited by one of my cousins, Karl de Rauville,
to go with him and shoot ducks on the marshes, at daybreak.
My cousin was a jolly fellow of forty, with red hair, very stout
and bearded, a country gentleman, an amiable semi-brute, of a
happy disposition and endowed with that Gallic wit which makes
even mediocrity agreeable. He lived in a house, half farmhouse,
half chateau, situated in a broad valley through which a river
ran. The hills right and left were covered with woods, old
manorial woods where magnificent trees still remained, and where
the rarest feathered game in that part of France was to be found.
Eagles were shot there occasionally, and birds of passage, such
as rarely venture into our over-populated part of the country,
invariably lighted amid these giant oaks, as if they knew or
recognized some little corner of a primeval forest which had
remained there to serve them as a shelter during their short
nocturnal halt.
In the valley there were large meadows watered by trenches and
separated by hedges; then, further on, the river, which up to
that point had been kept between banks, expanded into a vast
marsh. That marsh was the best shooting ground I ever saw. It was
my cousin's chief care, and he kept it as a preserve. Through the
rushes that covered it, and made it rustling and rough, narrow
passages had been cut, through which the flat-bottomed boats,
impelled and steered by poles, passed along silently over dead
water, brushing up against the reeds and making the swift fish
take refuge in the weeds, and the wild fowl, with their pointed,
black heads, dive suddenly.
I am passionately fond of the water: of the sea, though it is too
vast, too full of movement, impossi-ble to hold; of the rivers
which are so beautiful, but which pass on, and flee away and
above all of the marshes, where the whole unknown existence of
aquatic animals palpitates. The marsh is an entire world in
itself on the world of earth--a different world, which has its
own life, its settled inhabitants and its passing travelers, its
voices, its noises, and above all its mystery. Nothing is more
impressive, nothing more disquieting, more terrifying
occasionally, than a fen. Why should a vague terror hang over
these low plains covered with water? Is it the low rustling of
the rushes, the strange will-o'-the-wisp lights, the silence
which prevails on calm nights, the still mists which hang over
the surface like a shroud; or is it the almost inaudible
splashing, so slight and so gentle, yet sometimes more terrifying
than the cannons of men or the thunders of the skies, which make
these marshes resemble countries one has dreamed of, terrible
countries holding an unknown and dangerous secret?
No, something else belongs to it--another mystery, profounder and
graver, floats amid these thick mists, perhaps the mystery of the
creation itself! For was it not in stagnant and muddy water, amid
the heavy humidity of moist land under the heat of the sun, that
the first germ of life pulsated and expanded to the day?
I arrived at my cousin's in the evening. It was freezing hard
enough to split the stones.
During dinner, in the large room whose side-boards, walls, and
ceiling were covered with stuffed birds, with wings extended or
perched on branches  to which they were nailed,--hawks, herons,
owls, nightjars, buzzards, tiercels, vultures, falcons,--my
cousin who, dressed in a sealskin jacket, himself resembled some
strange animal from a cold country, told me what preparations he
had made for that same night.
We were to start at half past three in the morning, so as to
arrive at the place which he had chosen for our watching-place at
about half past four. On that spot a hut had been built of lumps
of ice, so as to shelter us somewhat from the trying wind which
precedes daybreak, a wind so cold as to tear the flesh like a
saw, cut it like the blade of a knife, prick it like a poisoned
sting, twist it like a pair of pincers, and burn it like fire.
My cousin rubbed his hands: "I have never known such a frost," he
said; "it is already twelve degrees below zero at six o'clock in
the evening."
I threw myself on to my bed immediately after we had finished our
meal, and went to sleep by the light of a bright fire burning in
the grate.
At three o'clock he woke me. In my turn, I put on a sheepskin,
and found my cousin Karl covered with a bearskin. After having
each swallowed two cups of scalding coffee, followed by glasses
of liqueur brandy, we started, accompanied by a gamekeeper and
our dogs, Plongeon and Pierrot.
From the first moment that I got outside, I felt chilled to the
very marrow. It was one of those nights on which the earth seems
dead with cold. The frozen air becomes resisting and palpable,
such pain does it cause; no breath of wind moves it, it is fixed
and motionless; it bites you, pierces through you, dries you,
kills the trees, the plants, the insects, the small birds
themselves, who fall from the branches on to the hard ground, and
become stiff themselves under the grip of the-cold.
The moon, which was in her last quarter and was inclining all to
one side, seemed fainting in the midst of space, so weak that she
was unable to wane, forced to stay up yonder, seized and
paralyzed by the severity of the weather. She shed a cold,
mournful light over the world, that dying and wan light which she
gives us every month, at the end of her period.
Karl and I walked side by side, our backs bent, our hands in our
pockets and our guns under our arms. Our boots, which were
wrapped in wool so that we might be able to walk without slipping
on the frozen river, made no sound, and I looked at the white
vapor which our dogs' breath made.
We were soon on the edge of the marsh, and entered one of the
lanes of dry rushes which ran through the low forest.
Our elbows, which touched the long, ribbonlike leaves, left a
slight noise behind us, and I was seized, as I had never been
before, by the powerful and singular emotion which marshes cause
in me. This one was dead, dead from cold, since we were walking
on it, in the middle of its population of dried rushes.
Suddenly, at the turn of one of the lanes, I perceived the
ice-hut which had been constructed to shelter us. I went in, and
as we had nearly an hour to wait before the wandering birds would
awake, I rolled myself up in my rug in order to try and get warm.
Then, lying on my back, I began to look at the misshapen moon,
which had four horns through the vaguely transparent walls of
this polar house. But the frost of the frozen marshes, the cold
of these walls, the cold from the firmament penetrated me so
terribly that I began to cough. My cousin Karl became uneasy.
"No matter if we do not kill much to-day," he said: "I do not
want you to catch cold; we will light a fire." And he told the
gamekeeper to cut some rushes.
We made a pile in the middle of our hut which had a hole in the
middle of the roof to let out the smoke, and when the red flames
rose up to the clear, crystal blocks they began to melt, gently,
imperceptibly, as if they were sweating. Karl, who had remained
outside, called out to me: "Come and look here!" I went out of
the hut and remained struck with astonishment. Our hut, in the
shape of a cone, looked like an enormous diamond with a heart of
fire which had been suddenly planted there in the midst of the
frozen water of the marsh. And inside, we saw two fantastic
forms, those of our dogs, who were warming themselves at the
fire.
But a peculiar cry, a lost, a wandering cry, passed over our
heads, and the light from our hearth showed us the wild birds.
Nothing moves one so much as the first clamor of a life which one
does not see, which passes through the somber air so quickly and
so far off, just before the first streak of a winter's day
appears on the horizon. It seems to me, at this glacial hour of
dawn, as if that passing cry which is carried away by the wings
of a bird is the sigh of a soul from the world!
"Put out the fire," said Karl, "it is getting daylight."
The sky was, in fact, beginning to grow pale, and the flights of
ducks made long, rapid streaks which were soon obliterated on the
sky.
A stream of light burst out into the night; Karl had fired, and
the two dogs ran forward.
And then, nearly every minute, now he, now I, aimed rapidly as
soon as the shadow of a flying flock appeared above the rushes.
And Pierrot and Plongeon, out of breath but happy, retrieved the
bleeding birds, whose eyes still, occasionally, looked at us.
The sun had risen, and it was a bright day with a blue sky, and
we were thinking of taking our departure, when two birds with
extended necks and outstretched wings, glided rapidly over our
heads. I fired, and one of them fell almost at my feet. It was a
teal, with a silver breast, and then, in the blue space above me,
I heard a voice, the voice of a bird. It was a short, repeated,
heart-rending lament; and the bird, the little animal that had
been spared began to turn round in the blue sky, over our heads,
looking at its dead companion which I was holding in my hand.
Karl was on his knees, his gun to his shoulder watching it
eagerly, until it should be within shot. "You have killed the
duck," he said, "and the drake will not fly away."
He certainly did not fly away; he circled over our heads
continually, and continued his cries. Never have any groans of
suffering pained me so much as that desolate appeal, as that
lamentable reproach of this poor bird which was lost in space.
Occasionally he took flight under the menace of the gun which
followed his movements, and seemed ready to continue his flight
alone, but as he could not make up his mind to this, he returned
to find his mate.
"Leave her on the ground," Karl said to me, "he will come within
shot by and by." And he did indeed come near us, careless of
danger, infatuated by his animal love, by his affection for his
mate, which I had just killed.
Karl fired, and it was as if somebody had cut the string which
held the bird suspended. I saw something black descend, and I
heard the noise of a fall among the rushes. And Pierrot brought
it to me.
I put them--they were already cold--into the same game-bag, and I
returned to Paris the same evening.
THE INN
Like all the little wooden inns in the higher Alps, tiny auberges
situated in the bare and rocky gorges which intersect the white
summits of the mountains, the inn of Schwarenbach is a refuge for
travelers who are crossing the Gemmi.
It is open six months in the year, and is inhabited by the family
of Jean Hauser. As soon as the snow begins to fall, and fills the
valley so as to make the road down to Loeche impassable, the
father, with mother, daughter, and the three sons depart, leaving
the house in charge of the old guide, Gaspard Hari, with the
young guide, Ulrich Kunsi, and Sam, the great mountain dog.
The two men and the dog remain till spring in their snowy prison,
with nothing before their eyes except immense, white slopes of
the Balmhorn, surrounded by light, glistening summits, and shut
up, blocked up, and buried by the snow which rises around them,
enveloping and almost burying the little house up to the eaves.
It was the day on which the Hauser family were going to return to
Loeche, as winter was approaching, and the descent was becoming
dangerous. Three mules started first, laden with baggage and led
by the three sons. Then the mother, Jeanne Hauser, and her
daughter Louise mounted a fourth mule, and set off in their turn.
The father followed them, accompanied by the two men in charge,
who were to escort the family as far as the brow of the descent.
First of all they skirted the small lake, now frozen over, at the
foot of the mass of rocks which stretched in front of the inn;
then they followed the valley, which was dominated on all sides
by snow-covered peaks.
A ray of sunlight glinted into that little white, glistening,
frozen desert, illuminating it with a cold and dazzling flame. No
living thing appeared among this ocean of hills; there was no
stir in that immeasurable solitude, no noise disturbed the
profound silence.
By degrees the young guide, Ulrich Kunsi, a tall, long-legged
Swiss, left daddy Hauser and old Gaspard behind, in order to
catch up with the mule which carried the two women. The younger
one looked at him as he approached, as if she would call him with
her sad eyes. She was a young, light-haired peasant girl, whose
milk-white cheeks and pale hair seemed to have lost their color
by long dwelling amid the ice. When Ulrich had caught up with the
animal which carried the women, he put his hand on the crupper,
and relaxed his speed. Mother Hauser began to talk to him, and
enumerated with minutest detail all that he would have to attend
to during the winter. It was the first winter he would spend up
there, while old Hari had already spent fourteen winters amid the
snow, at the inn of Schwarenbach.
Ulrich Kunsi listened, without appearing to understand, and
looked incessantly at the girl. From time to time he replied:
"Yes, Madame Hauser"; but his thoughts seemed far away, and his
calm features remained unmoved.
They reached Lake Daube, whose broad, frozen surface reached to
the bottom of the valley. On the right, the Daubenhorn showed its
black mass, rising up in a peak above the enormous moraines of
the Lommeon glacier, which soared above the Wildstrubel. As they
approached the neck of the Gemmi, where the descent to Loeche
begins, the immense horizon of the Alps of the Valais, from which
the broad, deep valley of the Rhone separated them, came in view.
In the distance, there was a group of white, unequal, flat or
pointed mountain summits, which glistened in the sun; the
Mischabel with its twin peaks, the huge group of the Weisshorn,
the heavy Brunegghorn, the lofty and formidable pyramid of Mont
Cervin, slayer of men, and the Dent Blanche, that terrible
coquette.
Then beneath them, as at the bottom of a terrible abyss, they saw
Loeche, its houses looking like grains of sand which had been
thrown into that enormous crevice which finishes and closes the
Gemmi, and which opens, down below, on to the Rhone.
The mule stopped at the edge of the path, which turns and twists
continually, zigzagging fantastically and strangely along the
steep side of the mountain, as far as the almost invisible little
village at its feet. The women jumped into the snow, and the two
old men joined them.
"Well," father Hauser said, "good-bye, and keep up your spirits
till next year, my friends," and old Hari replied: "Till next
year."
They embraced each other, and then Madame Hauser in her turn,
offered her cheek, and the girl did the same. When Ulrich Kunsi's
turn came, he whispered in Louise's ear:
"Do not forget those up yonder," and she replied: "No," in such a
low voice, that he guessed what she had said, without hearing it.
"Well, adieu," Jean Hauser repeated, "and don't fall ill." Then,
going before the two women, he commenced the descent, and soon
all three disappeared at the first turn in the road, while the
two men returned to the inn at Schwarenbach.
They walked slowly side by side, without speaking. The parting
was over, and they would be alone together for four or five
months. Then Gaspard Hari began to relate his life last winter.
He had remained with Michael Canol, who was too old now to stand
it; for an accident might happen during that long solitude. They
had not been dull, however; the only thing was to be resigned to
it from the first, and in the end one would find plenty of
distraction, games and other means of whiling away the time.
Ulrich Kunsi listened to him with his eyes on the ground, for in
thought he was with those who were descending to the village.
They soon came in sight of the inn, which was scarcely visible,
so small did it look, a mere black speck at the foot of that
enormous billow of snow. When they opened the door, Sam, the
great curly dog, began to romp round them.
"Come, my boy," old Gaspard said, "we have no women now, so we
must get our own dinner ready. Go and peel the potatoes." And
they both sat down on wooden stools, and began to put the bread
into the soup.
The next morning seemed very long to Kunsi. Old Hari smoked and
smoked beside the hearth, while the young man looked out of the
window at the snow-covered mountain opposite the house. In the
afternoon he went out, and going over the previous day's ground
again, he looked for the traces of the mule that had carried the
two women; then when he had reached the neck of the Gemmi, he
laid himself down on his stomach, and looked at Loeche.
The village, in its rocky pit, was not yet buried under the snow,
although the white masses came quite close to it, balked,
however, of their prey by the pine woods which protected the
hamlet. From his vantage point the low houses looked like
paving-stones in a large meadow. Hauser's little daughter was
there now in one of those gray-colored houses. In which? Ulrich
Kunsi was too far away to be able to make them out separately.
How he would have liked to go down while he was yet able!
But the sun had disappeared behind the lofty crest of the
Wildstrubel, and the young man returned to the chalet. Daddy Hari
was smoking, and, when he saw his mate come in, proposed a game
of cards to him. They sat down opposite each other for a long
time and played the simple game called brisque; then they had
supper and went to bed.
The following days were like the first, bright and cold, without
any more snow. Old Gaspard spent his afternoons in watching the
eagles and other rare birds which ventured on to those frozen
heights; while Ulrich journeyed regularly to the neck of the
Gemmi to look at the village. In the evening they played at
cards, dice, or dominoes, and lost and won trifling sums, just to
create an interest in the game.
One morning Hari, who was up first, called his companion. A
moving cloud of white spray, deep and light, was falling on them
noiselessly, and burying them by degrees under a dark, thick
coverlet of foam. This lasted four days and four nights. It was
necessary to free the door and the windows, to dig out a passage,
and to cut steps to get over this frozen powder, which a
twelve-hours' frost had made as hard as the granite of the
moraines.
They lived like prisoners, not venturing outside their abode.
They had divided their duties and performed them regularly.
Ulrich Kunsi undertook the scouring, washing, and everything that
belonged to cleanliness. He also chopped up the wood, while
Gaspard Hari did the cooking and attended to the fire. Their
regular and monotonous work was relieved by long games at cards
or dice, but they never quarreled, and were always calm and
placid. They were never even impatient or ill-humored, nor did
they ever use hard words, for they had laid in a stock of
patience for this wintering on the top of the mountain.
Sometimes old Gaspard took his rifle and went after chamois, and
occasionally killed one. Then there was a feast in the inn at
Schwarenbach, and they reveled in fresh meat. One morning he went
out as usual. The thermometer outside marked eighteen degrees of
frost, and as the sun had not yet risen, the hunter hoped to
surprise the animals at the approaches to the Wildstrubel.
Ulrich, being alone, remained in bed until ten o'clock. He was of
a sleepy nature, but would not have dared to give way like that
to his inclination in the presence of the old guide, who was ever
an early riser. He breakfasted leisurely with Sam, who also spent
his days and nights in sleeping in front of the fire; then he
felt low-spirited and even frightened at the solitude, and was
seized by a longing for his daily game of cards, as one is by the
domination of an invincible habit. So he went out to meet his
companion, who was to return at four o'clock.
The snow had leveled the whole deep valley, filled up the
crevasses, obliterated all signs of the two lakes and covered the
rocks, so that between the high summits there was nothing but an
immense, white, regular, dazzling, and frozen surface. For three
weeks, Ulrich had not been to the edge of the precipice, from
which he had looked down on to the village, and he wanted to go
there before climbing the slopes which led to the Wildstrubel.
Loeche was now covered by the snow, and the houses could scarcely
be distinguished, hidden as they were by that white cloak.
Turning to the right, Ulrich reached the Lammern glacier. He
strode along with a mountaineer's long swinging pace, striking
the snow, which was as hard as a rock, with his iron-shod stick,
and with piercing eyes looking for the little black, moving speck
in the distance, on that enormous, white expanse.
When he reached the end of the glacier he stopped, and asked
himself whether the old man had taken that road, and then he
began to walk along the moraines with rapid and uneasy steps. The
day was declining; the snow was assuming a rosy tint, and a dry,
frozen wind blew in rough gusts over its crystal surface. Ulrich
uttered a long, shrill, vibrating call. His voice sped through
the deathlike silence in which the mountains were sleeping; it
reached into the distance, over the profound and motionless waves
of glacial foam, like the cry of a bird over the waves of the
sea; then it died away and nothing answered him.
He started off again. The sun had sunk behind the mountain tops,
which still were purpled with the reflection from the heavens;
but the depths of the valley were becoming gray, and suddenly the
young man felt frightened. It seemed to him as if the silence,
the cold, the solitude, the wintry death of these mountains were
taking possession of him, were stopping and freezing his blood,
making his limbs grow stiff, and turning him into a motionless
and frozen object; and he began to run rapidly toward the
dwelling. The old man, he thought, would have returned during his
absence. He had probably taken another road; and would, no doubt,
be sitting before the fire, with a dead chamois at his feet.
He soon came in sight of the inn, but no smoke rose from it.
Ulrich ran faster. Opening the door he met Sam who ran up to him
to greet him, but Gaspard Hari had not returned. Kunsi, in his
alarm, turned round suddenly, as if he had expected to find his
comrade hidden in a corner. Then he relighted the fire and made
the soup; hoping every moment to see the old man come in. From
time to time he went out to see if Gaspard were not in sight. It
was night now, that wan night of the mountain, a livid night,
with the crescent moon, yellow and dim, just disappearing behind
the mountain tops, and shining faintly on the edge of the
horizon.
Then the young man went in and sat down to warm his hands and
feet, while he pictured to himself every possible sort of
accident. Gaspard might have broken a leg, have fallen into a
crevasse, have taken a false step and dislocated his ankle.
Perhaps he was lying on the snow, overcome and stiff with the
cold, in agony of mind, lost and perhaps shouting for help,
calling with all his might, in the silence of the night.
But where? The mountain was so vast, so rugged, so dangerous in
places, especially at that time of the year, that it would have
required ten or twenty guides walking for a week in all
directions, to find a man in that immense space. Ulrich Kunsi,
however, made up his mind to set out with Sam, if Gaspard did not
return by one in the morning; and he made his preparations.
He put provisions for two days into a bag, took his steel
climbing-irons, tied a long, thin, strong rope round his waist
and looked to see that his iron-shod stick and his ax, which
served to cut steps in the ice, were in order. Then he waited.
The fire was burning on the hearth, the great dog was snoring in
front of it, and the clock was ticking in its case of resounding
wood, as regularly as a heart beating.
He waited, his ears on the alert for distant sounds, and shivered
when the wind blew against the roof and the walls. It struck
twelve, and he trembled. Then, as he felt frightened and shivery,
he put some water on the fire, so that he might have hot coffee
before starting. When the clock struck one he got up, woke Sam,
opened the door and went off in the direction of the Wildstrubel.
For five hours he ascended, scaling the rocks by means of his
climbing-irons, cutting into the ice, advancing continually, and
occasionally hauling up the dog, who remained below at the foot
of some slope that was too steep for him, by means of the rope.
About six o'clock he reached one of the summits to which old
Gaspard often came after chamois, and he waited till it should be
day-light.
The sky was growing pale overhead, and suddenly a strange light,
springing, nobody could tell whence, suddenly illuminated the
immense ocean of pale mountain peaks, which stretched for many
leagues around him. It seemed as if this vague brightness arose
from the snow itself, in order to spread itself into space. By
degrees the highest and most distant summits assumed a delicate,
fleshlike rose color, and the red sun appeared behind the
ponderous giants of the Bernese Alps.
Ulrich Kunsi set off again, walking like a hunter, stooping and
looking for any traces, and saying to his dog: "Seek old fellow,
seek!"
He was descending the mountain now, scanning the depths closely,
and from time to time shouting, uttering a loud, prolonged
familiar cry which soon died away in that silent vastness. Then,
he put his ear to the ground, to listen. He thought he could
distinguish a voice, and so he began to run and shout again. But
he heard nothing more and sat down, worn out and in despair.
Toward midday he breakfasted and gave Sam, who was as tired as
himself, something to eat also; then he recommenced his search.
When evening came he was still walking, having traveled more than
thirty miles over the mountains. As he was too far away to return
home, and too tired to drag himself along any further, he dug a
hole in the snow and crouched in it with his dog, under a blanket
which he had brought with him. The man and the dog lay side by
side, warming themselves one against the other, but frozen to the
marrow, nevertheless. Ulrich scarcely slept, his mind haunted by
visions and his limbs shaking with cold.
Day was breaking when he got up. His legs were as stiff as iron
bars, and his spirits so low that he was ready to weep, while his
heart was beating so that he almost fell with excitement whenever
he thought he heard a noise.
Suddenly he imagined that he ALSO was going to die of cold in the
midst of this vast solitude. The terror of such a death roused
his energies and gave him renewed vigor. He was descending toward
the inn, falling down and getting up again, and followed at a
distance by Sam, who was limping on three legs. They did not
reach Schwarenbach until four o'clock in the afternoon. The house
was empty, and the young man made a fire, had something to eat,
and went to sleep, so worn-out that he did not think of anything
more.
He slept for a long time, for a very long time, the unconquerable
sleep of exhaustion. But suddenly a voice, a cry, a name:
"Ulrich," aroused him from his profound slumber, and made him sit
up in bed. Had he been dreaming? Was it one of those strange
appeals which cross the dreams of disquieted minds? No, he heard
it still, that reverberating cry,--which had entered at his ears
and remained in his brain,--thrilling him to the tips of his
sinewy fingers. Certainly, somebody had cried out, and called:
"Ulrich!" There was somebody there, near the house, there could
be no doubt of that, and he opened the door and shouted: "Is it
you, Gaspard?" with all the strength of his lungs. But there was
no reply, no murmur, no groan, nothing. It was quite dark, and
the snow looked wan.
The wind had risen, that icy wind which cracks the rocks, and
leaves nothing alive on those deserted heights. It came in sudden
gusts, more parching and more deadly than the burning wind of the
desert, and again Ulrich shouted: "Gaspard! Gaspard! Gaspard!"
Then he waited again. Everything was silent on the mountain! Then
he shook with terror, and with a bound he was inside the inn. He
shut and bolted the door, and then fell into a chair, trembling
all over, for he felt certain that his comrade had called him at
the moment of dissolution.
He was certain of that, as certain as one is of conscious life or
of taste when eating. Old Gaspard Hari had been dying for two
days and three nights somewhere, in some hole, in one of those
deep, untrodden ravines whose whiteness is more sinister than
subterranean darkness. He had been dying for two days and three
nights and he had just then died, thinking of his comrade. His
soul, almost before it was released, had taken its flight to the
inn where Ulrich was sleeping, and it had called him by that
terrible and mysterious power which the spirits of the dead
possess. That voiceless soul had cried to the worn-out soul of
the sleeper; it had uttered its last farewell, or its reproach,
or its curse on the man who had not searched carefully enough.
And Ulrich felt that it was there, quite close to him, behind the
wall, behind the door which he had just fastened. It was
wandering about, like a night bird which skims a lighted window
with his wings, and the terrified young man was ready to scream
with horror. He wanted to run away, but did not dare go out; he
did not dare, and would never dare in the future, for that
phantom would remain there day and night, round the inn, as long
as the old man's body was not recovered and deposited in the
consecrated earth of a churchyard.
Daylight came, and Kunsi recovered some of his courage with the
return of the bright sun. He prepared his meal, gave his dog some
food, and then remained motionless on a chair, tortured at heart
as he thought of the old man lying on the snow. Then, as soon as
night once more covered the mountains, new terrors assailed him.
He now walked up and down the dark kitchen, which was scarcely
lighted by the flame of one candle. He walked from one end of it
to the other with great strides, listening, listening to hear the
terrible cry of the preceding night again break the dreary
silence outside. He felt himself alone, unhappy man, as no man
had ever been alone before! Alone in this immense desert of snow,
alone five thousand feet above the inhabited earth; above human
habitations, above that stirring, noisy, palpitating life, alone
under an icy sky! A mad longing impelled him to run away, no
matter where, to get down to Loeche by flinging himself over the
precipice; but he did not even dare to open the door, as he felt
sure that the other, the DEAD, man would bar his road, so that he
might not be obliged to remain up there alone.
Toward midnight, tired with walking, worn-out by grief and fear,
he fell into a doze in his chair, for he was afraid of his bed,
as one is of a haunted spot. But suddenly the strident cry of the
preceding evening pierced his ears, so shrill that Ulrich
stretched out his arms to repulse the ghost, and he fell on to
his back with his chair.
Sam, who was awakened by the noise, began to howl as frightened
dogs do, and trotted all about the house trying to find out where
the danger came from. When he got to the door, he sniffed beneath
it, smelling vigorously, with his coat bristling and his tail
stiff while he growled angrily. Kunsi, who was terrified, jumped
up, and holding his chair by one leg, cried: "Don't come in,
don't come in, or I shall kill you." And the dog, excited by this
threat, barked angrily at that invisible enemy who defied his
master's voice. By degrees, however, he quieted down, came back
and stretched himself in front of the fire. But he was uneasy,
and kept his head up, and growled between his teeth.
Ulrich, in turn, recovered his senses, but as he felt faint with
terror, he went and got a bottle of brandy out of the sideboard,
and drank off several glasses, one after another, at a gulp. His
ideas became vague, his courage revived, and a feverish glow ran
through his veins.
He ate scarcely anything the next day, and limited himself to
alcohol; so he lived for several days, like a drunken brute. As
soon as he thought of Gaspard Hari he began to drink again, and
went on drinking until he fell on to the floor, overcome by
intoxication. And there he remained on his face, dead drunk, his
limbs benumbed, and snoring with his face to the ground. But
scarcely had he digested the maddening and burning liquor, than
the same cry, "Ulrich," woke him like a bullet piercing his
brain, and he got up, still staggering, stretching out his hands
to save himself from falling, and calling to Sam to help him. And
the dog, who appeared to be going mad like his master, rushed to
the door, scratched it with his claws, and gnawed it with his
long white teeth, while the young man, his neck thrown back, and
his head in the air, drank the brandy in gulps, as if it were
cold water, so that it might by and by send his thoughts, his
frantic terror, and his memory, to sleep again.
In three weeks he had consumed all his stock of ardent spirits.
But his continual drunkenness only lulled his terror, which awoke
more furiously than ever, as soon as it was impossible for him to
calm it by drinking. His fixed idea, which had been intensified
by a month of drunkenness, and which was continually increasing
in his absolute solitude? pene-trated him like a gimlet. He now
walked about his house like a wild beast in its cage, putting his
eat to the door to listen if the other were there, and defying
him through the wall. Then as soon as he dozed, overcome by
fatigue, he heard the voice which made him leap to his feet.
At last one night, as cowards do when driven to extremity, he
sprang to the door and opened it, to see who was calling him, and
to force him to keep quiet. But such a gust of cold wind blew
into his face that it chilled him to the bone. He closed and
bolted the door again immediately, without noticing that Sam had
rushed out. Then, as he was shivering with cold, he threw some
wood on the fire, and sat down in front of it to warm himself.
But suddenly he started, for somebody was scratching at the wall,
and crying. In desperation he called out: "Go away!" but was
answered by another long, sorrowful wail.
Then all his remaining senses forsook him, from sheer fright. He
repeated: "Go away!" and turned round to find some corner in
which to hide, while the other person went round the house still
crying, and rubbing against the wall. Ulrich went to the oak
sideboard, which was full of plates and dishes and of provisions,
and lifting it up with superhuman strength, he dragged it to the
door, so as to form a barricade. Then piling up all the rest of
the furniture, the mattresses, paillasses, and chairs, he stopped
up the windows as men do when assailed by an enemy.
But the person outside now uttered long, plaintive, mournful
groans, to which the young man replied by similar groans, and
thus days and nights passed without their ceasing to howl at each
other. The one was continually walking round the house and
scraped the walls with his nails so vigorously that it seemed as
if he wished to destroy them, while the other, inside, followed
all his movements, stooping down, and holding his ear to the
walls, and replying to all his appeals with terrible cries. One
evening, however, Ulrich heard nothing more, and he sat down, so
overcome by fatigue that he went to sleep immediately, and awoke
in the morning without a thought, without any recollection of
what had happened, just as if his head had been emptied during
his heavy sleep. But he felt hungry, and he ate.
The winter was over, and the Gemmi pass was practicable again, so
the Hauser family started off to return to their inn. As soon as
they had reached the top of the ascent, the women mounted their
mule, and spoke about the two men who they would meet again
shortly. They were, indeed, rather surprised that neither of them
had come down a few days before, as soon as the road became
passable, in order to tell them all about their long winter
sojourn. At last, however, they saw the inn, still covered with
snow, like a quilt. The door and the windows were closed, but a
little smoke was coming out of the chimney, which reassured old
Hauser; on going up to the door, however, he saw the skeleton of
an animal which had been torn to pieces by the eagles, a large
skeleton lying on its side.
They all looked closely at it, and the mother said: "That must be
Sam." Then she shouted: "Hi! Gaspard!" A cry from the interior of
the house answered her, so sharp a cry that one might have
thought some animal uttered it. Old Hauser repeated: "Hi!
Gaspard!" and they heard another cry, similar to the first.
Then the three men, the father and the two sons, tried to open
the door, but it resisted their efforts. From the empty cow-stall
they took a beam to serve as a battering-ram, and hurled it
against the door with all their might. The wood gave way, and the
boards flew into splinters; then the house was shaken by a loud
voice, and inside, behind the sideboard which was overturned,
they saw a man standing upright, his hair falling on to his
shoulders and a beard descending to his breast, with shining eyes
and nothing but rags to cover him. They did not recognize him,
but Louise Hauser exclaimed: "It is Ulrich, mother." And her
mother declared that it was Ulrich, although his hair was white.
He allowed them to go up to him, and to touch him, but he did not
reply to any of their questions, and they were obliged to take
him to Loeche, where the doctors found that he was mad. Nobody
ever knew what had become of his companion.
Little Louise Hauser nearly died that summer of decline, which
the medical men attributed to the cold air of the mountains.
A FAMILY
I was going to see my friend Simon Radevin once more, for I had
not seen him for fifteen years. Formerly he was my most intimate
friend, and I used to spend long, quiet, and happy evenings with
him. He was one of those men to whom one tells the most intimate
affairs of the heart, and in whom one finds, when quietly
talking, rare, clever, ingenious, and refined thoughts--thoughts
which stimulate and capture the mind.
For years we had scarcely been separated: we had lived, traveled,
thought, and dreamed together; had liked the same things with the
same liking, admired the same books, comprehended the same works,
shivered with the same sensations, and very often laughed at the
same individuals, whom we understood completely, by merely
exchanging a glance.
Then he married--quite unexpectedly married a little girl from
the provinces, who had come to Paris in search of a husband. How
ever could that little, thin, insipidly fair girl, with her weak
hands, her light, vacant eyes, and her clear, silly voice, who was
exactly like a hundred thousand marriageable dolls, have picked up
that intelligent, clever young fellow? Can anyone understand these
things? No doubt he had hoped for happiness, simple, quiet, and
long-enduring happiness, in the arms of a good, tender, and
faithful woman; he had seen all that in the transparent looks of
that schoolgirl with light hair.
He had not dreamed of the fact that an active, living, and
vibrating man grows tired as soon as he has comprehended the
stupid reality of a common-place life, unless indeed, he becomes
so brutalized as to be callous to externals.
What would he be like when I met him again? Still lively, witty,
light-hearted, and enthusiastic, or in a state of mental torpor
through provincial life? A man can change a great deal in the
course of fifteen years!
The train stopped at a small station, and as I got out of the
carriage, a stout, a very stout man with red cheeks and a big
stomach rushed up to me with open arms, exclaiming: "George!"
I embraced him, but I had not recognized him, and then I said, in
astonishment: "By Jove! You have not grown thin!"
And he replied with a laugh: "What did you expect? Good living, a
good table, and good nights! Eating and sleeping, that is my
existence!"
I looked at him closely, trying to find the features I held so
dear in that broad face. His eyes alone had not altered, but I no
longer saw the same looks in them, and I said to myself: "If
looks be the reflection of the mind, the thoughts in that head
are not what they used to be--those thoughts which I knew so
well."
Yet his eyes were bright, full of pleasure and friendship, but
they had not that clear, intelligent expression which tells
better than do words the value of the mind. Suddenly he said to
me:
"Here are my two eldest children." A girl of fourteen, who was
almost a woman, and a boy of thirteen, in the dress of a pupil
from a lycee, came forward in a hesitating and awkward manner,
and I said in a low voice: "Are they yours?"
"Of course they are," he replied laughing.
"How many have you?"
"Five! There are three more indoors."
He said that in a proud, self-satisfied, almost triumphant
manner, and I felt profound pity, mingled with a feeling of vague
contempt for this vainglorious and simple reproducer of his
species, who spent his nights in his country house in uxorious
pleasures.
I got into a carriage, which he drove himself, and we set off
through the town, a dull, sleepy, gloomy town where nothing was
moving in the streets save a few dogs and two or three
maidservants. Here and there a shopkeeper standing at his door
took off his hat, and Simon returned the salute and told me the
man's name--no doubt to show me that he knew all the inhabitants
personally. The thought struck me that he was thinking of
becoming a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies, that dream of
all who have buried themselves in the provinces.
We were soon out of the town; the carriage turned into a garden
which had some pretensions to a park, and stopped in front of a
turreted house, which tried to pass for a chateau.
"That is my den," Simon said, so that he might be complimented on
it, and I replied that it was delightful.
A lady appeared on the steps, dressed up for a visitor, her hair
done for a visitor, and with phrases ready prepared for a
visitor. She was no longer the light-haired, insipid girl I had
seen in church fifteen years previously, but a stout lady in
curls and flounces, one of those ladies of uncertain age, without
intellect, without any of those things which constitute a woman.
In short she was a mother, a stout, commonplace mother, a human
layer and brood mare, a machine of flesh which procreates,
without mental care save for her children and her housekeeping
book.
She welcomed me, and I went into the hall, where three children,
ranged according to their height, were ranked for review, like
firemen before a mayor. "Ah! ah! so there are the others?" said
I. And Simon, who was radiant with pleasure, named them: "Jean,
Sophie, and Gontran."
The door of the drawing-room was open. I went in, and in the
depths of an easy-chair I saw something trembling, a man, an old,
paralyzed man. Madame Radevin came forward and said: "This is my
grandfather, Monsieur; he is eighty-seven." And then she shouted
into the shaking old man's ears: "This is a friend of Simon's,
grandpapa."
The old gentleman tried to say "Good day" to me, and he muttered:
"Oua, oua, oua," and waved his hand.
I took a seat saying: "You are very kind, Monsieur."
Simon had just come in, and he said with a laugh: "So! You have
made grandpapa's acquaintance. He is priceless, is that old man.
He is the delight of the children, and he is so greedy that he
almost kills himself at every meal. You have no idea what he
would eat if he were allowed to do as he pleased. But you will
see, you will see. He looks all the sweets over as if they were
so many girls. You have never seen anything funnier; you will see
it presently."
I was then shown to my room to change my dress for dinner, and
hearing a great clatter behind me on the stairs, I turned round
and saw that all the children were following me behind their
father--to do me honor, no doubt.
My windows looked out on to a plain, a bare, interminable plain,
an ocean of grass, of wheat, and of oats, without a clump of
trees or any rising ground, a striking and melancholy picture of
the life which they must be leading in that house.
A bell rang; it was for dinner, and so I went downstairs. Madame
Radevin took my arm in a ceremonious manner, and we went into the
dining-room. A footman wheeled in the old man's arm-chair, who
gave a greedy and curious look at the dessert, as with difficulty
he turned his shaking head from one dish to the other.
Simon rubbed his hands, saying: "You will be amused." All the
children understood that I was going to be indulged with the
sight of their greedy grandfather and they began to laugh
accordingly, while their mother merely smiled and shrugged her
shoulders. Simon, making a speaking trumpet of his hands, shouted
at the old man: "This evening there is sweet rice-cream," and the
wrinkled face of the grandfather brightened, he trembled
violently all over, showing that he had understood and was very
pleased. The dinner began.
"Just look!" Simon whispered. The grandfather did not like the
soup, and refused to eat it; but he was made to, on account of
his health. The footman forced the spoon into his mouth, while
the old man blew energetically, so as not to swallow the soup,
which was thus scattered like a stream of water on to the table
and over his neighbors. The children shook with delight at the
spectacle, while their father, who was also amused, said: "Isn't
the old man funny?"
During the whole meal they were all taken up solely with him.
With his eyes he devoured the dishes which were put on the table,
and with trembling hands tried to seize them and pull them to
him. They put them almost within his reach to see his useless
efforts. his trembling clutches at them, the piteous appeal of
his whole nature, of his eyes, of his mouth, and of his nose as
he smelled them. He slobbered on to his table napkin with
eagerness, while uttering inarticulate grunts, and the whole
family was highly amused at this horrible and grotesque scene.
Then they put a tiny morsel on to his plate, which he ate with
feverish gluttony, in order to get something more as soon as
possible. When the rice-cream was brought in, he nearly had a
fit, and groaned with greediness. Gontran called out to him: "You
have eaten too much already; you will have no more." And they
pretended not to give him any. Then he began to cry--cry and
tremble more violently than ever, while all the children laughed.
At last, however, they gave him his helping, a very small piece.
As he ate the first mouthful of the pudding, he made a comical
and greedy noise in his throat, and a movement with his neck like
ducks do, when they swallow too large a morsel, and then, when he
had done, he began to stamp his feet, so as to get more.
I was seized with pity for this pitiable and ridiculous Tantalus,
and interposed on his behalf: "Please, will you not give him a
little more rice?"
But Simon replied: "Oh! no my dear fellow, if he were to eat too
much, it might harm him at his age."
I held my tongue, and thought over these words. Oh! ethics! Oh!
logic! Oh! wisdom! At his age! So they deprived him of his only
remaining pleasure out of regard for his health! His health! What
would he do with it, inert and trembling wreck that he was? They
were taking care of his life, so they said. His life? How many
days? Ten, twenty, fifty, or a hundred? Why? For his own sake? Or
to preserve for some time longer, the spectacle of his impotent
greediness in the family.
There was nothing left for him to do in this life, nothing
whatever. He had one single wish left, one sole pleasure; why not
grant him that last solace constantly, until he died?
After playing cards for a long time, I went up to my room and to
bed: I was low-spirited and sad, sad, sad! I sat at my window,
but I heard nothing but the beautiful warbling of a bird in a
tree, somewhere in the distance. No doubt the bird was singing
thus in a low voice during the night, to lull his mate, who was
sleeping on her eggs.
And I thought of my poor friend's five children, and to myself
pictured him snoring by the side of his ugly wife,
BELLFLOWER[1]
[1] Clochette.
How strange are those old recollections which haunt us, without
our being able to get rid of them!
This one is so very old that I cannot understand how it has clung
so vividly and tenaciously to my memory. Since then I have seen
so many sinister things, either affecting or terrible, that I am
astonished at not being able to pass a single day without the
face of Mother Bellflower recurring to my mind's eye, just as I
knew her formerly, long, long ago, when I was ten or twelve years
old.
She was an old seamstress who came to my parents' house once a
week, every Thursday, to mend the linen. My parents lived in one
of those country houses called chateaux, which are merely old
houses with pointed roofs, to which are attached three or four
adjacent farms.
The village, a large village, almost a small market town, was a
few hundred yards off, and nestled round the church, a red brick
church, which had become black with age.
Well, every Thursday Mother Bellflower came between half past six
and seven in the morning, and went immediately into the
linen-room and began to work. She was a tall, thin, bearded or
rather hairy woman, for she had a beard all over her face, a
surprising, an unexpected beard, growing in improbable tufts, in
curly bunches which looked as if they had been sown by a madman
over that great face, the face of a gendarme in petticoats. She
had them on her nose, under her nose, round her nose, on her
chin, on her cheeks; and her eyebrows, which were extraordinarily
thick and long, and quite gray, bushy and bristling, looked
exactly like a pair of mustaches stuck on there by mistake.
She limped, but not like lame people generally do, but like a
ship pitching. When she planted her great, bony, vibrant body on
her sound leg, she seemed to be preparing to mount some enormous
wave, and then suddenly she dipped as if to disappear in an
abyss, and buried herself in the ground. Her walk reminded one of
a ship in a storm, and her head, which was always covered with an
enormous white cap, whose ribbons fluttered down her back, seemed
to traverse the horizon from North to South and from South to
North, at each limp.
I adored Mother Bellflower. As soon as I was up I used to go into
the linen-room, where I found her installed at work, with a
foot-warmer under her feet. As soon as I arrived, she made me
take the foot-warmer and sit upon it, so that I might not catch
cold in that large, chilly room under the roof.
"That draws the blood from your head," she would say to me.
She told me stories, while mending the linen with her long,
crooked, nimble fingers; behind her magnifying spectacles, for
age had impaired her sight, her eyes appeared enormous to me,
strangely profound, double.
As far as I can remember from the things which she told me and by
which my childish heart was moved, she had the large heart of a
poor woman. She told me what had happened in the village, how a
cow had escaped from the cowhouse and had been found the next
morning in front of Prosper Malet's mill, looking at the sails
turning, or about a hen's egg which had been found in the church
belfry without anyone being able to understand what creature had
been there to lay it, or the queer story of Jean Pila's dog, who
had gone ten leagues to bring back his master's breeches which a
tramp had stolen while they were hanging up to dry out of doors,
after he had been caught in the rain. She told me these simple
adventures in such a manner that in my mind they assumed the
proportions of never-to-be-forgotten dramas, of grand and
mysterious poems; and the ingenious stories invented by the
poets, which my mother told me in the evening, had none of the
flavor, none of the fullness or of the vigor of the peasant
woman's narratives.
Well, one Thursday when I had spent all the morning in listening
to Mother Clochette, I wanted to go upstairs to her again during
the day, after picking hazelnuts with the manservant in the wood
behind the farm. I remember it all as clearly as what happened
only yesterday.
On opening the door of the linen-room, I saw the old seamstress
lying on the floor by the side of her chair, her face turned down
and her arms stretched out, but still holding her needle in one
hand and one of my shirts in the other. One of her legs in a blue
stocking, the longer one no doubt, was extended under her chair,
and her spectacles glistened by the wall, where they had rolled
away from her.
I ran away uttering shrill cries. They all came running, and in a
few minutes I was told that Mother Clochette was dead.
I cannot describe the profound, poignant, terrible emotion which
stirred my childish heart. I went slowly down into the
drawing-room and hid myself in a dark corner, in the depths of a
great, old arm-chair, where I knelt and wept. I remained there
for a long time no doubt, for night came on. Suddenly some one
came in with a lamp--without seeing me, however--and I heard my
father and mother talking with the medical man, whose voice I
recognized.
He had been sent for immediately, and he was explaining the cause
of the accident, of which I understood nothing, however. Then he
sat down and had a glass of liqueur and a biscuit.
He went on talking, and what he then said will remain engraved on
my mind until I die! I think that I can give the exact words
which he used.
"Ah!" said he, "the poor woman! she broke her leg the day of my
arrival here. I had not even had time to wash my hands after
getting off the diligence before I was sent for in all haste, for
it was a bad case, very bad.
"She was seventeen, and a pretty girl, very pretty! Would anyone
believe it? I have never told her story before, in fact no one
but myself and one other person, who is no longer living in this
part of the country, ever knew it. Now that she is dead, I may be
less discreet.
"A young assistant teacher had just come to live in the village;
he was good-looking and had the bearing of a soldier. All the
girls ran after him, but he was disdainful. Besides that, he was
very much afraid of his superior, the schoolmaster, old Grabu,
who occasionally got out of bed the wrong foot first.
"Old Grabu already employed pretty Hortense, who has just died
here, and who was afterward nicknamed Clochette. The assistant
master singled out the pretty young girl, who was no doubt
flattered at being chosen by this disdainful conqueror; at any
rate, she fell in love with him, and he succeeded in persuading
her to give him a first meeting in the hayloft behind the school,
at night, after she had done her day's sewing.
"She pretended to go home, but instead of going downstairs when
she left the Grabus', she went upstairs and hid among the hay, to
wait for her lover. He soon joined her, and he was beginning to
say pretty things to her, when the door of the hayloft opened and
the schoolmaster appeared, and asked: 'What are you doing up
there, Sigisbert?' Feeling sure that he would be caught, the
young school-master lost his presence of mind and replied
stupidly: 'I came up here to rest a little among the bundles of
hay, Monsieur Grabu.'
"The loft was very large and absolutely dark. Sigisbert pushed
the frightened girl to the further end and said: 'Go there and
hide yourself. I shall lose my situation, so get away and hide
yourself.'
"When the schoolmaster heard the whispering, he continued: 'Why,
you are not by yourself?'
" 'Yes I am, Monsieur Grabu!'
" 'But you are not, for you are talking.'
" 'I swear I am, Monsieur Grabu.'
" 'I will soon find out,' the old man replied, and double-locking
the door, he went down to get a light.
"Then the young man, who was a coward such as one sometimes
meets, lost his head, and he repeated, having grown furious all
of a sudden: 'Hide yourself, so that he may not find you. You
will deprive me of my bread for my whole life; you will ruin my
whole career! Do hide yourself!'
"They could hear the key turning in the lock again, and Hortense
ran to the window which looked out on to the street, opened it
quickly, and then in a low and determined voice said: 'You will
come and pick me up when he is gone,' and she jumped out.
"Old Grabu found nobody, and went down again in great surprise. A
quarter of an hour later, Monsieur Sigisbert came to me and
related his adventure. The girl had remained at the foot of the
wall unable to get up, as she had fallen from the second story,
and I went with him to fetch her. It was raining in torrents, and
I brought the unfortunate girl home with me, for the right leg
was broken in three places, and the bones had come out through
the flesh. She did not complain, and merely said, with admirable
resignation: 'I am punished, well punished!'
"I sent for assistance and for the workgirl's friends and told
them a made-up story of a runaway carriage which had knocked her
down and lamed her, outside my door. They believed me, and the
gendarmes for a whole month tried in vain to find the author of
this accident.
"That is all! Now I say that this woman was a heroine, and had
the fiber of those who accomplish the grandest deeds in history.
"That was her only love affair, and she died a virgin. She was a
martyr, a noble soul, a sublimely devoted woman! And if I did not
absolutely admire her, I should not have told you this story,
which I would never tell anyone during her life: you understand
why."
The doctor ceased; mamma cried and papa said some words which I
did not catch; then they left the room, and I remained on my
knees in the armchair and sobbed, while I heard a strange noise
of heavy footsteps and something knocking against the side of the
staircase.
They were carrying away Clochette's body.
WHO KNOWS?
My God! My God! I am going to write down at last what has
happened to me. But how can I? How dare I? The thing is so
bizarre, so inexplicable, so incomprehensible, so silly!
If I were not perfectly sure of what I have seen, sure that there
was not in my reasoning any defect, any error in my declarations,
any lacuna in the inflexible sequence of my observations, I
should believe myself to be the dupe of a simple hallucination,
the sport of a singular vision. After all, who knows?
Yesterday I was in a private asylum, but I went there
voluntarily, out of prudence and fear. Only one single human
being knows my history, and that is the doctor of the said
asylum. I am going to write to him. I really do not know why? To
disembarrass myself? Yea, I feel as though weighed down by an
intolerable nightmare.
Let me explain.
I have always been a recluse, a dreamer, a kind of isolated
philosopher, easy-going, content with but little, harboring
ill-feeling against no man, and without even a grudge against
heaven. I have constantly lived alone; consequently, a kind of
torture takes hold of me when I find myself in the presence of
others. How is this to be explained? I do not know. I am not
averse to going out into the world, to conversation, to dining
with friends, but when they are near me for any length of time,
even the most intimate of them, they bore me, fatigue me,
enervate me, and I experience an overwhelming, torturing desire
to see them get up and go, to take themselves away, and to leave
me by myself.
That desire is more than a craving; it is an irresistible
necessity. And if the presence of people with whom I find myself
were to be continued; if I were compelled, not only to listen,
but also to follow, for any length of time, their conversation, a
serious accident would assuredly take place. What kind of
accident? Ah! who knows? Perhaps a slight paralytic stroke?
Probably!
I like solitude so much that I cannot even endure the vicinage of
other beings sleeping under the same roof. I cannot live in
Paris, because there I suffer the most acute agony. I lead a
moral life, and am therefore tortured in body and in nerves by
that immense crowd which swarms and lives even when it sleeps.
Ah! the sleeping of others is more painful still than their
conversation. And I can never find repose when I know and feel
that on the other side of a wall several existences are
undergoing these regular eclipses of reason.
Why am I thus? Who knows? The cause of it is very simple perhaps.
I get tired very soon of everything that does not emanate from
me. And there are many people in similar case.
We are, on earth, two distinct races. Those who have need of
others, whom others amuse, engage soothe, whom solitude harasses,
pains, stupefies, like the movement of a terrible glacier or the
traversing of the desert; and those, on the contrary, whom others
weary, tire, bore, silently torture, whom isolation calms and
bathes in the repose of independency, and plunges into the humors
of their own thoughts. In fine, there is here a normal, physical
phenomenon. Some are constituted to live a life outside of
themselves, others, to live a life within themselves. As for me,
my exterior associations are abruptly and painfully short-lived,
and, as they reach their limits, I experience in my whole body
and in my whole intelligence an intolerable uneasiness.
As a result of this, I became attached, or rather had become much
attached, to inanimate objects, which have for me the importance
of beings, and my house has or had become a world in which I
lived an active and solitary life, surrounded by all manner of
things, furniture, familiar knickknacks, as sympathetic in my
eyes as the visages of human beings. I had filled my mansion with
them; little by little, I had adorned it with them, and I felt an
inward content and satisfaction, was more happy than if I had
been in the arms of a beloved girl, whose wonted caresses had
become a soothing and delightful necessity.
I had had this house constructed in the center of a beautiful
garden, which hid it from the public high-ways, and which was
near the entrance to a city where I could find, on occasion, the
resources of society, for which, at moments, I had a longing. All
my domestics slept in a separate building, which was situated at
some considerable distance from my house, at the far end of the
kitchen garden, which in turn was surrounded by a high wall. The
obscure envelopment of night, in the silence of my concealed
habitation, buried under the leaves of great trees, was so
reposeful and so delicious, that before retiring to my couch I
lingered every evening for several hours in order to enjoy the
solitude a little longer.
One day "Signad" had been played at one of the city theaters. It
was the first time that I had listened to that beautiful,
musical, and fairy-like drama, and I had derived from it the
liveliest pleasures.
I returned home on foot with a light step, my head full of
sonorous phrases, and my mind haunted by delightful visions. It
was night, the dead of night, and so dark that I could hardly
distinguish the broad highway, and consequently I stumbled into
the ditch more than once. From the custom-house, at the barriers,
to my house, was about a mile, perhaps a little more--a leisurely
walk of about twenty minutes. It was one o'clock in the morning,
one o'clock or maybe half-past one; the sky had by this time
cleared somewhat and the crescent appeared, the gloomy crescent
of the last quarter of the moon. The crescent of the first
quarter is that which rises about five or six o'clock in the
evening and is clear, gay, and fretted with silver; but the one
which rises after midnight is reddish, sad, and desolating--it is
the true Sabbath crescent. Every prowler by night has made the same
observation. The first, though slender as a thread, throws a faint,
joyous light which rejoices the heart and lines the ground with
distinct shadows; the last sheds hardly a dying glimmer, and is so
wan that it occasions hardly any shadows.
In the distance, I perceived the somber mass of my garden, and, I
know not why, was seized with a feeling of uneasiness at the idea
of going inside. I slackened my pace, and walked very softly, the
thick cluster of trees having the appearance of a tomb in which
my house was buried.
I opened my outer gate and entered the long avenue of sycamores
which ran in the direction of the house, arranged vault-wise like
a high tunnel, traversing opaque masses, and winding round the
turf lawns, on which baskets of flowers, in the pale darkness,
could be indistinctly discerned.
While approaching the house, I was seized by a strange feeling. I
could hear nothing, I stood still. Through the trees there was
not even a breath of air stirring. "What is the matter with me?"
I said to myself. For ten years I had entered and re-entered in
the same way, without ever experiencing the least inquietude. I
never had any fear at nights. The sight of a man, a marauder, or
a thief would have thrown me into a fit of anger, and I would
have rushed at him without any hesitation. Moreover, I was
armed--I had my revolver. But I did not touch it, for I was
anxious to resist that feeling of dread with which I was seized.
What was it? Was it a presentiment--that mysterious presentiment
which takes hold of the senses of men who have witnessed
something which, to them, is inexplicable? Perhaps? Who knows?
In proportion as I advanced, I felt my skin quiver more and more,
and when I was close to the wall, near the outhouses of my large
residence, I felt that it would be necessary for me to wait a few
minutes before opening the door and going inside. I sat down,
then, on a bench, under the windows of my drawing-room. I rested
there, a little disturbed, with my head leaning against the wall,
my eyes wide open, under the shade of the foliage. For the first
few minutes, I did not observe anything unusual around me; I had
a humming noise in my ears, but that has happened often to me.
Sometimes it seemed to me that I heard trains passing, that I
heard clocks striking, that I heard a multitude on the march.
Very soon, those humming noises became more distinct, more
concentrated, more determinable, I was deceiving myself. It was
not the ordinary tingling of my arteries which transmitted to my
ears these rumbling sounds, but it was a very distinct, though
confused, noise which came, without any doubt whatever, from the
interior of my house. Through the walls I distinguished this
continued noise,--I should rather say agitation than noise,--an
indistinct moving about of a pile of things, as if people were
tossing about, displacing, and carrying away surreptitiously all
my furniture.
I doubted, however, for some considerable time yet, the evidence
of my ears. But having placed my ear against one of the
outhouses, the better to discover what this strange disturbance
was, inside my house, I became convinced, certain, that something
was taking place in my residence which was altogether abnormal
and incomprehensible. I had no fear, but I was--how shall I
express it--paralyzed by astonishment. I did not draw my
revolver, knowing very well that there was no need of my doing
so.
I listened a long time, but could come to no resolution, my mind
being quite clear, though in myself I was naturally anxious. I
got up and waited, listening always to the noise, which gradually
increased, and at intervals grew very loud, and which seemed to
become an impatient, angry disturbance, a mysterious commotion.
Then, suddenly, ashamed of my timidity, I seized my bunch of
keys. I selected the one I wanted, guided it into the lock,
turned it twice, and pushing the door with all my might, sent it
banging against the partition.
The collision sounded like the report of a gun, and there
responded to that explosive noise, from roof to basement of my
residence, a formidable tumult. It was so sudden, so terrible, so
deafening, that I recoiled a few steps, and though I knew it to
be wholly useless, I pulled my revolver out of its case.
I continued to listen for some time longer. I could distinguish
now an extraordinary pattering upon the steps of my grand
staircase, on the waxed floors, on the carpets, not of boots, or
of naked feet, but of iron and wooden crutches, which resounded
like cymbals. Then I suddenly discerned, on the threshold of my
door, an armchair, my large reading easy-chair, which set off
waddling. It went away through my garden. Others followed it,
those of my drawing-room, then my sofas, dragging themselves
along like crocodiles on their short paws; then all my chairs,
bounding like goats, and the little foot-stools, hopping like
rabbits.
Oh! what a sensation! I slunk back into a clump of bushes where I
remained crouched up, watching, meanwhile, my furniture defile
past--for everything walked away, the one behind the other,
briskly or slowly, according to its weight or size. My piano, my
grand piano, bounded past with the gallop of a horse and a murmur
of music in its sides; the smaller articles slid along the gravel
like snails, my brushes, crystal, cups and saucers, which
glistened in the moonlight. I saw my writing desk appear, a rare
curiosity of the last century, which contained all the letters I
had ever received, all the history of my heart, an old history
from which I have suffered so much! Besides, there were inside of
it a great many cherished photographs.
Suddenly--I no longer had any fear--I threw myself on it, seized
it as one would seize a thief, as one would seize a wife about to
run away; but it pursued its irresistible course, and despite my
efforts and despite my anger, I could not even retard its pace.
As I was resisting in desperation that insuperable force, I was
thrown to the ground. It then rolled me over, trailed me along
the gravel, and the rest of my furniture, which followed it,
began to march over me, tramping on my legs and injuring them.
When I loosed my hold, other articles had passed over my body,
just as a charge of cavalry does over the body of a dismounted
soldier.
Seized at last with terror, I succeeded in dragging myself out of
the main avenue, and in concealing myself again among the
shrubbery, so as to watch the disappearance of the most cherished
objects, the smallest, the least striking, the least unknown
which had once belonged to me.
I then heard, in the distance, noises which came from my
apartments, which sounded now as if the house were empty, a loud
noise of shutting of doors. They were being slammed from top to
bottom of my dwelling, even the door which I had just opened
myself unconsciously, and which had closed of itself, when the
last thing had taken its departure. I took flight also, running
toward the city, and only regained my self-composure, on reaching
the boulevards, where I met belated people. I rang the bell of a
hotel were I was known. I had knocked the dust off my clothes
with my hands, and I told the porter that I had lost my bunch of
keys, which included also that to the kitchen garden, where my
servants slept in a house standing by itself, on the other side
of the wall of the inclosure which protected my fruits and
vegetables from the raids of marauders.
I covered myself up to the eyes in the bed which was assigned to
me, but could not sleep; and I waited for the dawn listening to
the throbbing of my heart. I had given orders that my servants
were to be summoned to the hotel at daybreak, and my valet de
chambre knocked at my door at seven o'clock in the morning.
His countenance bore a woeful look.
"A great misfortune has happened during the night, Monsieur,"
said he.
"What is it?"
"Somebody has stolen the whole of Monsieur's furniture, all,
everything, even to the smallest articles."
This news pleased me. Why? Who knows? I was complete master of
myself, bent on dissimulating, on telling no one of anything I
had seen; determined on concealing and in burying in my heart of
hearts a terrible secret. I responded:
"They must then be the same people who have stolen my keys. The
police must be informed immediately. I am going to get up, and I
will join you in a few moments."
The investigation into the circumstances under which the robbery
might have been committed lasted for five months. Nothing was
found, not even the smallest of my knickknacks, nor the least
trace of the thieves. Good gracious! If I had only told them what
I knew--If I had said--I should have been locked up--I, not the
thieves--for I was the only person who had seen everything from
the first.
Yes! but I knew how to keep silence. I shall never refurnish my
house. That were indeed useless. The same thing would happen
again. I had no desire even to re-enter the house, and I did not
re-enter it; I never visited it again. I moved to Paris, to the
hotel, and consulted doctors in regard to the condition of my
nerves, which had disquieted me a good deal ever since that awful
night.
They advised me to travel, and I followed their counsel.
II.
I began by making an excursion into Italy. The sunshine did me
much good. For six months I wandered about from Genoa to Venice,
from Venice to Florence, from Florence to Rome, from Rome to
Naples. Then I traveled over Sicily, a country celebrated for its
scenery and its monuments, relics left by the Greeks and the
Normans. Passing over into Africa, I traversed at my ease that
immense desert, yellow and tranquil, in which camels, gazelles,
and Arab vagabonds roam about--where, in the rare and transparent
atmosphere, there hover no vague hauntings, where there is never
any night, but always day.
I returned to France by Marseilles, and in spite of all its
Provencal gaiety, the diminished clearness of the sky made me
sad. I experienced, in returning to the Continent, the peculiar
sensation of an illness which I believed had been cured, and a
dull pain which predicted that the seeds of the disease had not
been eradicated.
I then returned to Paris. At the end of a month I was very
dejected. It was in the autumn, and I determined to make, before
winter came, an excursion through Normandy, a country with which
I was unacquainted.
I began my journey, in the best of spirits, at Rouen, and for
eight days I wandered about, passive, ravished, and enthusiastic,
in that ancient city, that astonishing museum of extraordinary
Gothic monuments.
But one afternoon, about four o'clock, as I was sauntering slowly
through a seemingly unattractive street, by which there ran a
stream as black as the ink called "Eau de Robec," my attention,
fixed for the moment on the quaint, antique appearance of some of
the houses, was suddenly attracted by the view of a series of
second-hand furniture shops, which followed one another, door
after door.
Ah! they had carefully chosen their locality, these sordid
traffickers in antiquities, in that quaint little street,
overlooking the sinister stream of water, under those tile and
slate-pointed roofs on which still grinned the vanes of bygone
days.
At the end of these grim storehouses you saw piled up sculptured
chests, Rouen, Sevres, and Moustier's pottery, painted statues,
others of oak, Christs, Virgins, Saints, church ornaments,
chasubles, capes, even sacred vases, and an old gilded wooden
tabernacle, where a god had hidden himself away. What singular
caverns there are in those lofty houses, crowded with objects of
every description, where the existence of things seems to be
ended, things which have survived their original possessors,
their century, their times, their fashions, in order to be bought
as curiosities by new generations.
My affection for antiques was awakened in that city of
antiquaries. I went from shop to shop, crossing in two strides
the rotten four plank bridges thrown over the nauseous current
of the "Eau de Robec."
Heaven protect me! What a shock! At the end of a vault, which was
crowded with articles of every description and which seemed to be
the entrance to the catacombs of a cemetery of ancient furniture,
I suddenly descried one of my most beautiful wardrobes. I
approached it, trembling in every limb, trembling to such an
extent that I dared not touch it, I put forth my hand, I
hesitated. Nevertheless it was indeed my wardrobe; a unique
wardrobe of the time of Louis XIII., recognizable by anyone who
had seen it only once. Casting my eyes suddenly a little farther,
toward the more somber depths of the gallery, I perceived three
of my tapestry covered chairs; and farther on still, my two Henry
II. tables, such rare treasures that people came all the way from
Paris to see them.
Think! only think in what a state of mind I now was! I advanced,
haltingly, quivering with emotion, but I advanced, for I am
brave--I advanced like a knight of the dark ages.
At every step I found something that belonged to me; my brushes,
my books, my tables, my silks, my arms, everything, except the
bureau full of my letters, and that I could not discover.
I walked on, descending to the dark galleries, in order to ascend
next to the floors above. I was alone; I called out, nobody
answered, I was alone; there was no one in that house--a house as
vast and tortuous as a labyrinth.
Night came on, and I was compelled to sit down in the darkness on
one of my own chairs, for I had no desire to go away. From time
to time I shouted, "Hallo, hallo, somebody."
I had sat there, certainly, for more than an hour when I heard
steps, steps soft and slow, I knew not where. I was unable to
locate them, but bracing myself up, I called out anew, whereupon
I perceived a glimmer of light in the next chamber.
"Who is there?" said a voice.
"A buyer," I responded.
"It is too late to enter thus into a shop."
"I have been waiting for you for more than an hour," I answered.
"You can come back to-morrow."
"To-morrow I must quit Rouen."
I dared not advance, and he did not come to me. I saw always the
glimmer of his light, which was shining on a tapestry on which
were two angels flying over the dead on a field of battle. It
belonged to me also. I said:
"Well, come here."
"I am at your service," he answered.
I got up and went toward him.
Standing in the center of a large room, was a little man, very
short, and very fat, phenomenally fat, a hideous phenomenon.
He had a singular straggling beard, white and yellow, and not a
hair on his head--not a hair!
As he held his candle aloft at arm's length in order to see me,
his cranium appeared to me to resemble a little moon, in that
vast chamber encumbered with old furniture. His features were
wrinkled and blown, and his eyes could not be seen.
I bought three chairs which belonged to myself, and paid at once
a large sum for them, giving him merely the number of my room at
the hotel. They were to be delivered the next day before nine
o'clock.
I then started off. He conducted me, with much politeness, as far
as the door.
I immediately repaired to the commissaire's office at the central
police depot, and told the commissaire of the robbery which had
been perpetrated and of the discovery I had just made. He
required time to communicate by telegraph with the authorities
who had originally charge of the case, for information, and he
begged me to wait in his office until an answer came back. An
hour later, an answer came back, which was in accord with my
statements.
"I am going to arrest and interrogate this man, at once," he said
to me, "for he may have conceived some sort of suspicion, and
smuggled away out of sight what belongs to you. Will you go and
dine and return in two hours: I shall then have the man here, and
I shall subject him to a fresh interrogation in your presence."
"Most gladly, Monsieur. I thank you with my whole heart."
I went to dine at my hotel and I ate better than I could have
believed. I was quite happy now, thinking that man was in the
hands of the police.
Two hours later I returned to the office of the police
functionary, who was waiting for me.
"Well, Monsieur," said he, on perceiving me, "we have not been
able to find your man. My agents cannot put their hands on him."
Ah! I felt my heart sinking.
"But you have at least found his house?" I asked.
"Yes, certainly; and what is more, it is now being watched and
guarded until his return. As for him, he has disappeared."
"Disappeared?"
"Yes, disappeared. He ordinarily passes his evenings at the house
of a female neighbor, who is also a furniture broker, a queer
sort of sorceress, the widow Bidoin. She has not seen him this
evening and cannot give any information in regard to him. We must
wait until to-morrow."
I went away. Ah! how sinister the streets of Rouen seemed to me,
now troubled and haunted!
I slept so badly that I had a fit of nightmare every time I went
off to sleep.
As I did not wish to appear too restless or eager, I waited till
ten o'clock the next day before reporting myself to the police.
The merchant had not reappeared. His shop remained closed.
The commissary said to me:
"I have taken all the necessary steps. The court has been made
acquainted with the affair. We shall go together to that shop and
have it opened, and you shall point out to me all that belongs to
you."
We drove there in a cab. Police agents were stationed round the
building; there was a locksmith, too, and the door of the shop
was soon opened.
On entering, I could not discover my wardrobes, my chairs, my
tables; I saw nothing, nothing of that which had furnished my
house, no, nothing, although on the previous evening, I could not
take a step without encountering something that belonged to me.
The chief commissary, much astonished, regarded me at first with
suspicion.
"My God, Monsieur," said I to him, "the disappearance of these
articles of furniture coincides strangely with that of the
merchant."
He laughed.
"That is true. You did wrong in buying and paying for the
articles which were your own property, yesterday. It was that
which gave him the cue."
"What seems to me incomprehensible," I replied, "is that all the
places that were occupied by my furniture are now filled by other
furniture."
"Oh!" responded the commissary, "he has had all night, and has no
doubt been assisted by accomplices. This house must communicate
with its neighbors. But have no fear, Monsieur; I will have the
affair promptly and thoroughly investigated. The brigand shall
not escape us for long, seeing that we are in charge of the den."
 * * * * * * *
Ah! My heart, my heart, my poor heart, how it beats!
I remained a fortnight at Rouen. The man did not return. Heavens!
good heavens! That man, what was it that could have frightened
and surprised him!
But, on the sixteenth day, early in the morning, I received from
my gardener, now the keeper of my empty and pillaged house, the
following strange letter:
"MONSIEUR:
"I have the honor to inform Monsieur that something happened, the
evening before last, which nobody can understand, and the police
no more than the rest of us. The whole of the furniture has been
returned, not one piece is missing--everything is in its place,
up to the very smallest article. The house is now the same in
every respect as it was before the robbery took place. It is
enough to make one lose one's head. The thing took place during
the night Friday--Saturday. The roads are dug up as though the
whole fence had been dragged from its place up to the door. The
same thing was observed the day after the disappearance of the
furniture.
"We are anxiously expecting Monsieur, whose very humble and
obedient servant, I am,
PHILLIPE RAUDIN."
"Ah! no, no, ah! never, never, ah! no. I shall never return
there!"
I took the letter to the commissary of police.
"It is a very clever restitution," said he. "Let us bury the
hatchet. We shall nip the man one of these days."
 * * * * * * *
But he has never been nipped. No. They have not nipped him, and I
am afraid of him now, as of some ferocious animal that has been
let loose behind me.
Inexplicable! It is inexplicable, this chimera of a moon-struck
skull! We shall never solve or comprehend it. I shall not return
to my former residence. What does it matter to me? I am afraid of
encountering that man again, and I shall not run the risk.
And even if he returns, if he takes possession of his shop, who
is to prove that my furniture was on his premises? There is only
my testimony against him; and I feel that that is not above
suspicion.
Ah! no! This kind of existence has become unendurable. I have not
been able to guard the secret of what I have seen. I could not
continue to live like the rest of the world, with the fear upon
me that those scenes might be re-enacted.
So I have come to consult the doctor who directs this lunatic
asylum, and I have told him everything.
After questioning me for a long time, he said to me:
"Will you consent, Monsieur, to remain here for some time?"
"Most willingly, Monsieur."
"You have some means?"
"Yes, Monsieur."
"Will you have isolated apartments?"
"Yes, Monsieur."
"Would you care to receive any friends?"
"No, Monsieur, no, nobody. The man from Rouen might take it into
his head to pursue me here, to be revenged on me."
 * * * * * * *
I have been alone, alone, all, all alone, for three months. I am
growing tranquil by degrees. I have no longer any fears. If the
antiquary should become mad . . . and if he should be brought
into this asylum! Even prisons themselves are not places of
security.
THE DEVIL
The peasant was standing opposite the doctor, by the bedside of
the dying old woman, and she, calmly resigned and quite lucid,
looked at them and listened to their talking. She was going to
die, and she did not rebel at it, for her life was over--she was
ninety-two.
The July sun streamed in at the window and through the open door
and cast its hot flames on to the uneven brown clay floor, which
had been stamped down by four generations of clodhoppers. The
smell of the fields came in also, driven by the brisk wind, and
parched by the noontide heat. The grasshoppers chirped themselves
hoarse, filling the air with their shrill noise, like that of the
wooden crickets which are sold to children at fair time.
The doctor raised his voice and said: "Honore, you cannot leave
your mother in this state; she may die at any moment." And the
peasant, in great distress, replied: "But I must get in my wheat,
for it has been lying on the ground a long time, and the weather
is just right for it; what do you say about it, mother?" And the
dying woman, still possessed by her Norman avariciousness,
replied YES with her eyes and her forehead, and so urged her son
to get in his wheat, and to leave her to die alone. But the
doctor got angry, and stamping his foot he said: "You are no
better than a brute, do you hear, and I will not allow you to do
it. Do you understand? And if you must get in your wheat to-day,
go and fetch Rapet's wife and make her look after your mother. I
WILL have it. And if you do not obey me, I will let you die like
a dog, when you are ill in your turn; do you hear me?"
The peasant, a tall, thin fellow with slow movements, who was
tormented by indecision, by his fear of the doctor and his keen
love of saving, hesitated, calculated, and stammered out: "How
much does La Rapet charge for attending sick people?"
"How should I know?" the doctor cried. "That depends upon how
long she is wanted for. Settle it with her, by Jove! But I want
her to be here within an hour, do you hear."
So the man made up his mind. "I will go for her," he replied;
"don't get angry, doctor." And the latter left, calling out as he
went: "Take care, you know, for I do not joke when I am angry!"
And as soon as they were alone, the peasant turned to his mother,
and said in a resigned voice: "I will go and fetch La Rapet, as
the man will have it. Don't go off while I am away."
And he went out in his turn.
La Rapet, who was an old washerwoman, watched the dead and the
dying of the neighborhood, and then, as soon as she had sewn her
customers into that linen cloth from which they would emerge no
more, she went and took up her irons to smooth the linen of the
living. Wrinkled like a last year's apple, spiteful, envious,
avaricious with a phenomenal avarice, bent double, as if she had
been broken in half across the loins, by the constant movement of
the iron over the linen, one might have said that she had a kind
of monstrous and cynical affection for a death struggle. She
never spoke of anything but of the people she had seen die, of
the various kinds of deaths at which she had been present, and
she related, with the greatest minuteness, details which were
always the same, just like a sportsman talks of his shots.
When Honore Bontemps entered her cottage, he found her preparing
the starch for the collars of the village women, and he said:
"Good evening; I hope you are pretty well, Mother Rapet."
She turned her head round to look at him and said: "Fairly well,
fairly well, and you?"
"Oh I as for me, I am as well as I could wish, but my mother is
very sick."
"Your mother?"
"Yes, my mother!"
"What's the matter with her?"
"She is going to turn up her toes, that's what's the matter with
her!"
The old woman took her hands out of the water and asked with
sudden sympathy: "Is she as bad as all that?"
"The doctor says she will not last till morning."
"Then she certainly is very bad!" Honore hesitated, for he wanted
to make a few preliminary remarks before coming to his proposal,
but as he could hit upon nothing, he made up his mind suddenly.
"How much are you going to ask to stop with her till the end? You
know that I am not rich, and I cannot even afford to keep a
servant-girl. It is just that which has brought my poor mother to
this state, too much work and fatigue! She used to work for ten,
in spite of her ninety-two years. You don't find any made of that
stuff nowadays!"
La Rapet answered gravely: "There are two prices. Forty sous by
day and three francs by night for the rich, and twenty sous by
day, and forty by night for the others. You shall pay me the
twenty and forty." But the peasant reflected, for he knew his
mother well. He knew how tenacious of life, how vigorous and
unyielding she was. He knew, too, that she might last another
week, in spite of the doctor's opinion, and so he said
resolutely: "No, I would rather you would fix a price until the
end. I will take my chance, one way or the other. The doctor says
she will die very soon. If that happens, so much the better for
you, and so much the worse for me, but if she holds out till
to-morrow or longer, so much the better for me and so much the
worse for you!"
The nurse looked at the man in astonishment, for she had never
treated a death as a speculative job, and she hesitated, tempted
by the idea of the possible gain. But almost immediately she
suspected that he wanted to juggle her. "I can say nothing until
I have seen your mother," she replied.
"Then come with me and see her."
She washed her hands, and went with him immediately. They did not
speak on the road; she walked with short, hasty steps, while he
strode on with his long legs, as if he were crossing a brook at
every step. The cows lying down in the fields, overcome by the
heat, raised their heads heavily and lowed feebly at the two
passers-by, as if to ask them for some green grass.
When they got near the house, Honore Bontemps murmured: "Suppose
it is all over?" And the unconscious wish that it might be so
showed itself in the sound of his voice.
But the old woman was not dead. She was lying on her back, on her
wretched bed, her hands covered with a pink cotton counterpane,
horribly thin, knotty paws, like some strange animal's, or like
crabs' claws, hands closed by rheumatism, fatigue, and the work
of nearly a century which she had accomplished.
La Rapet went up to the bed and looked at the dying woman, felt
her pulse, tapped her on the chest, listened to her breathing,
and asked her questions, so as to hear her speak: then, having
looked at her for some time longer, she went out of the room,
followed by Honore. His decided opinion was, that the old woman
would not last out the night, and he asked: "Well?" And the
sick-nurse replied: "Well, she may last two days, perhaps three.
You will have to give me six francs, everything included."
"Six francs! six francs!" he shouted. "Are you out of your mind?
I tell you that she cannot last more than five or six hours!" And
they disputed angrily for some time, but as the nurse said she
would go home, as the time was slipping away, and as his wheat
would not come to the farmyard of its own accord, he agreed to
her terms at last:
"Very well, then, that is settled; six francs including
everything, until the corpse is taken out."
"That is settled, six francs."
And he went away, with long strides, to his wheat, which was
lying on the ground under the hot sun which ripens the grain,
while the sick-nurse returned to the house.
She had brought some work with her, for she worked without
stopping by the side of the dead and dying, sometimes for
herself, sometimes for the family, who employed her as seamstress
also, paying her rather more in that capacity. Suddenly she
asked:
"Have you received the last sacrament, Mother Bontemps?"
The old peasant woman said "No" with her head, and La Rapet, who
was very devout, got up quickly: "Good heavens, is it possible? I
will go and fetch the cure"; and she rushed off to the parsonage
so quickly, that the urchins in the street thought some accident
had happened, when they saw her trotting off like that.
The priest came immediately in his surplice, preceded by a
choir-boy, who rang a bell to announce the passage of the Host
through the parched and quiet country. Some men, working at a
distance, took off their large hats and remained motionless until
the white vestment had disappeared behind some farm buildings;
the women who were making up the sheaves stood up to make the
sign of the cross; the frightened black hens ran away along the
ditch until they reached a well-known hole through which they
suddenly disappeared, while a foal, which was tied up in a
meadow, took fright at the sight of the surplice and began to
gallop round at the length of its rope, kicking violently. The
choir-boy, in his red cassock, walked quickly, and the priest,
the square biretta on his bowed head, followed him, muttering
some prayers. Last of all came La Rapet, bent almost double, as
if she wished to prostrate herself; she walked with folded hands,
as if she were in church.
Honore saw them pass in the distance, and he asked: "Where is our
priest going to?" And his man, who was more acute, replied: "He
is taking the sacrament to your mother, of course!"
The peasant was not surprised and said: "That is quite possible,"
and went on with his work.
Mother Bontemps confessed, received absolution and extreme
unction, and the priest took his departure, leaving the two women
alone in the suffocating cottage. La Rapet began to look at the
dying woman, and to ask herself whether it could last much
longer.
The day was on the wane, and a cooler air came in stronger puffs,
making a view of Epinal, which was fastened to the wall by two
pins, flap up and down. The scanty window curtains, which had
formerly been white, but were now yellow and covered with
fly-specks, looked as it they were going to fly off, and seemed
to struggle to get away, like the old woman's soul.
Lying motionless, with her eyes open, the old mother seemed to
await the death which was so near, and which yet delayed its
coming; with perfect indifference. Her short breath whistled in
her throat. It would stop altogether soon, and there would be one
woman less in the world, one whom nobody would regret.
At nightfall Honore returned, and when he went up to the bed and
saw that his mother was still alive he asked: "How is she?" just
as he had done formerly, when she had been sick. Then he sent La
Rapet away, saying to her: "To-morrow morning at five o'clock,
without fail." And she replied: "To-morrow at five o'clock."
She came at daybreak, and found Honore eating his soup, which he
had made himself, before going to work.
"Well, is your mother dead?" asked the nurse.
"She is rather better, on the contrary," he replied, with a
malignant look out of the corner of his eyes. Then he went out.
La Rapet was seized with anxiety, and went up to the dying woman,
who was in the same state, lethargic and impassive, her eyes open
and her hands clutching the counterpane. The nurse perceived that
this might go on thus for two days, four days, eight days, even,
and her avaricious mind was seized with fear. She was excited to
fury against the cunning fellow who had tricked her, and against
the woman who would not die.
Nevertheless, she began to sew and waited with her eyes fixed on
the wrinkled face of Mother Bontemps. When Honore returned to
breakfast he seemed quite satisfied, and even in a bantering
humor, for he was carrying in his wheat under very favorable
circumstances.
La Rapet was getting exasperated; every passing minute now seemed
to her so much time and money stolen from her. She felt a mad
inclination to choke this old ass, this headstrong old fool, this
obstinate old wretch--to stop that short, rapid breath, which was
robbing her of her time and money, by squeezing her throat a
little. But then she reflected on the danger of doing so, and
other thoughts came into her head, so she went up to the bed and
said to her: "Have you ever seen the Devil?"
Mother Bontemps whispered: "No."
Then the sick-nurse began to talk and to tell her tales likely to
terrify her weak and dying mind. "Some minutes before one dies
the Devil appears," she said, "to all. He has a broom in his
hand, a saucepan on his head and he utters loud cries. When
anybody had seen him, all was over, and that person had only a
few moments longer to live"; and she enumerated all those to whom
the Devil had appeared that year: Josephine Loisel, Eulalie
Ratier, Sophie Padagnau, Seraphine Grospied.
Mother Bontemps, who was at last most disturbed in mind, moved
about, wrung her hands, and tried to turn her head to look at the
other end of the room. Suddenly La Rapet disappeared at the foot
of the bed. She took a sheet out of the cupboard and wrapped
herself up in it; then she put the iron pot on to her head, so
that its three short bent feet rose up like horns, took a broom
in her right hand and a tin pail in her left, which she threw up
suddenly, so that it might fall to the ground noisily.
Certainly when it came down, it made a terrible noise. Then,
climbing on to a chair, the nurse showed herself, gesticulating
and uttering shrill cries into the pot which covered her face,
while she menaced the old peasant woman, who was nearly dead,
with her broom.
Terrified, with a mad look on her face, the dying woman made a
superhuman effort to get up and escape; she even got her
shoulders and chest out of bed; then she fell back with a deep
sigh. All was over, and La Rapet calmly put everything back into
its place; the broom into the corner by the cupboard, the sheet
inside it, the pot on to the hearth, the pail on to the floor,
and the chair against the wall. Then with a professional air, she
closed the dead woman's enormous eyes, put a plate on the bed and
poured some holy water into it, dipped the twig of boxwood into
it, and kneeling down, she fervently repeated the prayers for the
dead, which she knew by heart, as a matter of business.
When Honore returned in the evening, he found her praying. He
calculated immediately that she had made twenty sous out of him,
for she had only spent three days and one night there, which made
five francs altogether, instead of the six which he owed her.
EPIPHANY
"Ah!" said Captain the Count de Garens, "I should rather think
that I do remember that Epiphany supper, during the war!
"At the time I was quarter-master of cavalry, and for a fort
night, I had been lurking about as a scout in front of the German
advanced guard. The evening before we had cut down a few Uhlans
and had lost three men, one of whom was that poor little
Raudeville. You remember Joseph de Raudeville well, of course.
"Well, on that day my captain ordered me to take six troopers and
occupy the village of Porterin, where there had been five fights
in three weeks, and to hold it all night. There were not twenty
houses left standing, nay, not a dozen, in that wasp's nest. So I
took ten troopers, and set out at about four o'clock; at five
o'clock, while it was still pitch dark, we reached the first
houses of Porterin. I halted and ordered Marchas--you know Pierre
de Marchas, who afterward married little Martel-Auvelin, the
daughter of the Marquis de Martel-Auvelin--to go alone into the
village and to report to me what he saw.
"I had chosen nothing but volunteers, and all of good family.
When on service it is pleasant not to be forced into intimacy
with unpleasant fellows. This Marchas was as sharp as possible,
as cunning as a fox, and as supple as a serpent. He could scent
the Prussians as well as a dog can scent a hare, could find
victuals where we should have died of hunger without him, and
could obtain information from everybody--information which was
always reliable--with incredible cleverness.
"In ten minutes he returned. 'All right,' he said; 'there have
been no Prussians here for three days. It is a sinister place, is
this village. I have been talking to a Sister of Mercy, who is
attending to four or five wounded men in an abandoned convent.'
"I ordered them to ride on, and we penetrated into the principal
street. On the right and left we could vaguely see roofless
walls, hardly visible in the profound darkness. Here and there a
light was burning in a room; some family had remained to keep its
house standing as long as they were able; a family of brave, or
of poor, people. The rain began to fall, a fine, icy-cold rain,
which froze us before it wetted us through, by merely touching
our cloaks. The horses stumbled against stones, against beams,
against furniture. Marchas guided us, going before us on foot,
and leading his horse by the bridle.
" 'Where are you taking us to?' I asked him. And he replied: 'I
have a place for us to lodge in, and a rare good one.' And soon
we stopped before a small house, evidently belonging to some
person of the middle class, completely shut up, built on to the
street with a garden in the rear.
"Marchas broke open the lock by means of a big stone, which he
picked up near the garden gate; then he mounted the steps,
smashed in the front door with his feet and shoulders, lighted a
bit of wax candle, which he was never without, and preceded us
into the comfortable apartments of some rich private individual,
guiding us with admirable assurance, just as if he had lived in
this house which he now saw for the first time.
"Two troopers remained outside to take care of our horses; then
Marchas said to stout Ponderel, who followed him: 'The stables
must be on the left; I saw that as we came in; go and put the
animals up there, for we do not want them,' and then turning to
me he said: 'Give your orders, confound it all!'
"Marchas always astonished me, and I replied with a laugh: 'I
shall post my sentinels at the country approaches and I will
return to you here.'
" 'How many men are you going to take?'
" 'Five. The others will relieve them at five o'clock in the
evening.'
" 'Very well. Leave me four to look after provisions, to do the
cooking, and to set the table. I will go and find out where the
wine is hidden away.'
"I went off to reconnoiter the deserted streets, until they ended
in the open country, so as to post my sentries there.
"Half an hour later I was back, and found Marchas lounging in a
great armchair, the covering of which he had taken off, from love
of luxury as he said. He was warming his feet at the fire and
smoking an excellent cigar, whose perfume filled the room. He was
alone, his elbows resting on the arms of the chair, his cheeks
flushed, his eyes bright, and looking delighted.
"I heard the noise of plates and dishes in the next room, and
Marchas said to me, smiling in a beatific manner: 'This is
famous; I found the champagne under the flight of steps outside,
the brandy--fifty bottles of the very finest--in the kitchen
garden under a pear-tree, which did not look to me to be quite
straight, when I looked at it by the light of my lantern. As for
solids, we have two fowls, a goose, a duck, and three pigeons.
They are being cooked at this moment. It is a delightful part of
the country.'
"I had sat down opposite to him, and the fire in the grate was
burning my nose and cheeks.
" 'Where did you find this wood?' I asked.
" 'Splendid wood,' he replied. 'The owner's carriage. It is the
paint which is causing all this flame, an essence of alcohol and
varnish. A capital house!'
"I laughed, for I found the creature was funny, and he went on:
'Fancy this being the Epiphany! I have had a bean put into the
goose, but there is no queen; it is really very annoying!' And I
repeated like an echo: 'It is annoying, but what do you want me
to do in the matter?'
" 'To find some, of course.'
" 'Some women. Women?--you must be mad!'
" 'I managed to find the brandy under the pear-tree, and the
champagne under the steps; and yet there was nothing to guide me,
while as for you, a petticoat is a sure sign. Go and look, old
fellow.'
"He looked so grave, so convinced, that I could not tell whether
he was joking or not. So I replied: 'Look here, Marchas, are you
having a joke with me?'
" 'I never joke on duty.'
" 'But where the devil do you expect me to find any women?'
" 'Where you like; there must be two or three remaining in the
neighborhood, so ferret them out and bring them here.'
"I got up, for it was too hot in front of the fire, and Marchas
went on: 'Do you want an idea?'
" 'Yes.'
" 'Go and see the priest.'
" 'The priest? What for?'
" 'Ask him to supper, and beg him to bring a woman with him.'
" 'The priest! A woman! Ha! ha! ha!'
"But Marchas continued with extraordinary gravity: 'I am not
laughing; go and find the priest and tell him how we are
situated, and, as he must be horribly dull, he will come. But
tell him that we want one woman at least, a lady, of course,
since we are all men of the world. He is sure to have the names
of his female parishioners on the tips of his fingers, and if
there is one to suit us, and you manage it well, he will indicate
her to you.'
" 'Come, come, Marchas, what are you thinking of?'
" 'My dear Garens, you can do this quite well. It will be very
funny. We are well bred, by Jove! and we will put on our most
distinguished manners and our grandest style. Tell the abbe who
we are, make him laugh, soften him, seduce him, and persuade
him!'
" 'No, it is impossible.'
"He drew his chair close to mine, and as he knew my weak side,
the scamp continued: 'Just think what a swagger thing it will be
to do, and how amusing to tell about; the whole army will talk
about it, and it will give you a famous reputation.'
"I hesitated, for the adventure rather tempted me. He persisted:
'Come, my little Garens. You are in command of this detachment,
and you alone can go and call on the head of the church in this
neighborhood. I beg of you to go, and I promise you that after
the war, I will relate the whole affair in verse in the "Revue
des Deux Mondes." You owe this much to your men, for you have
made them march enough during the last month.'
"I got up at last and asked: 'Where is the parsonage?'
" 'Take the second turning at the end of the street; you will
then see an avenue, and at the end of the avenue you will find
the church. The parsonage is beside it.' As I departed he called
out: 'Tell him the bill of fare, to make him hungry!'
"I discovered the ecclesiastic's little house without any
difficulty; it was by the side of a large, ugly, brick church. As
there was neither bell nor knocker, I knocked at the door with my
fist, and a loud voice from inside asked: 'Who is there?' to
which I replied: 'A quartermaster of hussars.'
"I heard the noise of bolts, and of a key being turned. Then I
found myself face to face with a tall priest with a large
stomach, the chest of a prize-fighter, formidable hands
projecting from turned-up sleeves, a red face, and the looks of a
kind man. I gave him a military salute and said: 'Good day,
Monsieur le Cure.'
"He had feared a surprise, some marauders' ambush, and he smiled
as he replied: 'Good day, my friend; come in.' I followed him
into a small room, with a red tiled floor, in which a small fire
was burning, very different to Marchas's furnace. He gave me a
chair and said: 'What can I do for you?'
" 'Monsieur, allow me first of all to introduce myself'; and I
gave him my card, which he took and read half aloud: 'The Comte
de Garens.'
"I continued: 'There are eleven of us here Monsieur l'Abbe, five
on grand guard, and six installed at the house of an unknown
inhabitant. The names of the six are, Garens (that is I), Pierre
de Marchas, Ludovic de Ponderel, Baron d'Etreillis, Karl
Massouligny, the painter's son, and Joseph Herbon, a young
musician. I have come to ask you, in their name and my own, to do
us the honor of supping with us. It is an Epiphany supper,
Monsieur le Cure, and we should like to make it a little
cheerful.'
"The priest smiled and murmured: 'It seems to me to be hardly a
suitable occasion for amusing oneself.'
"I replied: 'We are fighting every day, Monsieur. Fourteen of our
comrades have been killed in a month, and three fell as late as
yesterday. That is war. We stake our life every moment; have we
not, therefore, the right to amuse ourselves freely? We are
Frenchmen, we like to laugh, and we can laugh everywhere. Our
fathers laughed on the scaffold! This evening we should like to
brighten ourselves up a little, like gentlemen, and not like
soldiers; you understand me, I hope. Are we wrong?'
"He replied quickly: 'You are quite right, my friend, and I
accept your invitation with great pleasure.' Then he called out:
'Hermance!'
"An old, bent, wrinkled, horrible, peasant woman appeared and
said: 'What do you want?'
" 'I shall not dine at home, my daughter.'
" 'Where are you going to dine then?'
" 'With some gentlemen, hussars.'
"I felt inclined to say: 'Bring your servant with you,' just to
see Marchas's face, but I did not venture to, and continued: 'Do
you know anyone among your parishioners, male or female, whom I
could invite as well?' He hesitated, reflected, and then said:
'No, I do not know anybody!'
"I persisted: 'Nobody? Come, Monsieur, think; it would be very
nice to have some ladies, I mean to say, some married couples! I
know nothing about your parishioners. The baker and his wife, the
grocer, the--the--the--watchmaker--the--shoemaker --the--the
chemist with his wife. We have a good spread, and plenty of wine,
and we should be enchanted to leave pleasant recollections of
ourselves behind us with the people here.'
"The priest thought again for a long time and then said
resolutely: 'No, there is nobody.'
"I began to laugh. 'By Jove, Monsieur le Cure, it is very vexing
not to have an Epiphany queen, for we have the bean. Come, think.
Is there not a married mayor, or a married deputy-mayor, or a
married municipal councilor, or schoolmaster?'
" 'No all the ladies have gone away.'
" 'What, is there not in the whole place some good tradesman's
wife with her good tradesman, to whom we might give this
pleasure, for it would be a pleasure to them, a great pleasure
under present circumstances?'
"But suddenly the cure began to laugh, and he laughed so
violently that he fairly shook, and exclaimed: 'Ha! ha! ha! I
have got what you want, yes. I have got what you want! Ha! ha!
ha! We will laugh and enjoy ourselves, my children, we will have
some fun. How pleased the ladies will be, I say, how delighted
they will be. Ha! ha! Where are you staying?'
"I described the house, and he understood where it was. 'Very
good,' he said. 'It belongs to Monsieur Bertin-Lavaille. I will
be there in half an hour, with four ladies. Ha! ha! ha! four
ladies!'
"He went out with me, still laughing, and left me, repeating:
'That is capital; in half an hour at Bertin-Lavaille's house.'
"I returned quickly, very much astonished and very much puzzled.
'Covers for how many?' Marchas asked, as soon as he saw me.
" 'Eleven. There are six of us hussars besides the priest and
four ladies.'
"He was thunderstruck, and I triumphant, and he repeated 'Four
ladies! Did you say, four ladies?'
" 'I said four women.'
" 'Real women?'
" 'Real women.'
" 'Well, accept my compliments!'
" 'I will, for I deserve them.'
"He got out of his armchair, opened the door, and I saw a
beautiful, white tablecloth on a long table, round which three
hussars in blue aprons were setting out the plates and glasses.
'There are some women coming!' Marchas cried. And the three men
began to dance and to cheer with all their might.
"Everything was ready, and we were waiting. We waited for nearly
an hour, while a delicious smell of roast poultry pervaded the
whole house. At last, however, a knock against the shutters made
us all jump up at the same moment. Stout Ponderel ran to open the
door, and in less than a minute a little Sister of Mercy appeared
in the doorway. She was thin, wrinkled, and timid, and
successively saluted the four bewildered hussars who saw her
enter. Behind her, the noise of sticks sounded on the tiled floor
in the vestibule. As soon as she had come into the drawing-room I
saw three old heads in white caps, following each other one by
one, balancing themselves with different movements, one canting
to the right, while the other canted to the left. Then three
worthy women showed themselves, limping, dragging their legs
behind them, crippled by illness and deformed through old age,
three infirm old women, past service, the only three pensioners
who were able to walk in the establishment which Sister
Saint-Benedict managed.
"She had turned round to her invalids, full of anxiety for them,
and then seeing my quartermaster's stripes, she said to me: 'I am
much obliged to you for thinking of these poor women. They have
very little pleasure in life, and you are at the same time giving
them a great treat and doing them a great honor.'
"I saw the priest, who had remained in the obscurity of the
passage, and who was laughing heartily, and I began to laugh in
my turn, especially when I saw Marchas's face. Then, motioning
the nun to the seats, I said: 'Sit down, Sister: we are very
proud and very happy that you have accepted our unpretentious
invitation.'
"She took three chairs which stood against the wall, set them
before the fire, led her three old women to them, settled them on
them, took their sticks and shawls which she put into a corner,
and then, pointing to the first, a thin woman with an enormous
stomach, who was evidently suffering from the dropsy, she said:
'This is Mother Paumelle, whose husband was killed by falling
from a roof, and whose son died in Africa; she is sixty years
old.' Then she pointed to another, a tall woman, whose head shook
unceasingly: 'This is Mother Jean-Jean, who is sixty-seven. She
is nearly blind, for her face was terribly singed in a fire, and
her right leg was half burned off.'
"Then she pointed to the third, a sort of dwarf, with protruding,
round, stupid eyes, which she rolled incessantly in all
directions. 'This is La Putois, an idiot. She is only
forty-four.'
"I bowed to the three women as if I were being presented to some
Royal Highness, and turning to the priest I said: 'You are an
excellent man, Monsieur l'Abbe, and we all owe you a debt of
gratitude.'
"Everybody was laughing, in fact, except Marchas, who seemed
furious, and just then Karl Massouligny cried: 'Sister
Saint-Benedict, supper is on the table!'
"I made her go first with the priest, then I helped up Mother
Paumelle, whose arm I took and dragged her into the next room,
which was no easy task, for her swollen stomach seemed heavier
than a lump of iron.
"Stout Ponderel gave his arm to Mother Jean-Jean, who bemoaned
her crutch, and little Joseph Herbon took the idiot, La Putois,
to the dining-room, which was filled with the odor of the viands.
"As soon as we were opposite our plates, the Sister clapped her
hands three times, and, with the precision of soldiers presenting
arms, the women made a rapid sign of the cross, and then the
priest slowly repeated the 'Benedictus' in Latin. Then we sat
down, and the two fowls appeared, brought in by Marchas, who
chose to wait rather than to sit down as a guest at this
ridiculous repast.
"But I cried: 'Bring the champagne at once!' and a cork flew out
with the noise of a pistol, and in spite of the resistance of the
priest and the kind Sister, the three hussars sitting by the side
of the three invalids, emptied their three full glasses down
their throats by force.
"Massouligny, who possessed the faculty of making himself at
home, and of being on good terms with everyone, wherever he was,
made love to Mother Paumelle, in the drollest manner. The
dropsical woman, who had retained her cheerfulness in spite of
her misfortunes, answered him banteringly in a high falsetto
voice which seemed to be assumed, and she laughed so heartily at
her neighbor's jokes that her large stomach looked as if it were
going to rise up and get on to the table. Little Herbon had
seriously undertaken the task of making the idiot drunk, and
Baron d'Etreillis whose wits were not always particularly sharp,
was questioning old Jean-Jean about the life, the habits, and the
rules in the hospital.
"The nun said to Massouligny in consternation: 'Oh! oh! you will
make her ill; pray do not make her laugh like that, Monsieur. Oh!
Monsieur.' Then she got up and rushed at Herbon to take a full
glass out of his hands which he was hastily emptying down La
Putois's throat, while the priest shook with laughter, and said
to the Sister: 'Never mind, just this once, it will not hurt her.
Do leave them alone.'
"After the two fowls they ate the duck, which was flanked by the
three pigeons and a blackbird, and then the goose appeared,
smoking, golden-colored, and diffusing a warm odor of hot,
browned fat meat. La Paumelle who was getting lively, clapped her
hands; La Jean-Jean left off answering the Baron's numerous
questions, and La Putois uttered grunts of pleasure, half cries
and half sighs, like little children do when one shows them
sweets. 'Allow me to carve this bird,' the cure said. 'I
understand these sort of operations better than most people.'
" 'Certainly, Monsieur l'Abbe,' and the Sister said: 'How would
it be to open the window a little; they are too warm, and I am
afraid they will be ill.'
"I turned to Marchas: 'Open the window for a minute.' He did so;
the cold outer air as it came in made the candles flare, and the
smoke from the goose--which the cure was scientifically carving,
with a table napkin round his neck--whirl about. We watched him
doing it, without speaking now, for we were interested in his
attractive handiwork, and also seized with renewed appetite at
the sight of that enormous golden-colored bird, whose limbs fell
one after another into the brown gravy at the bottom of the dish.
At that moment, in the midst of greedy silence which kept us all
attentive, the distant report of a shot came in at the open
window.
"I started to my feet so quickly that my chair fell down behind
me, and I shouted: 'Mount, all of you! You, Marchas, will take
two men and go and see what it is. I shall expect you back here
in five minutes.' And while the three riders went off at full
gallop through the night, I got into the saddle with my three
remaining hussars, in front of the steps of the villa, while the
cure, the Sister, and the three old women showed their frightened
faces at the window.
"We heard nothing more, except the barking of a dog in the
distance. The rain had ceased, and it was cold, very cold. Soon I
heard the gallop of a horse, of a single horse, coming back. It
was Marchas, and I called out to him: 'Well?'
" 'It is nothing; Francois has wounded an old peasant who refused
to answer his challenge and who continued to advance in spite of
the order to keep off. They are bringing him here, and we shall
see what is the matter.'
"I gave orders for the horses to be put back into the stable, and
I sent my two soldiers to meet the others, and returned to the
house. Then the cure, Marchas and I took a mattress into the room
to put the wounded man on; the Sister tore up a table napkin in
order to make lint, while the three frightened women remained
huddled up in a corner.
"Soon I heard the rattle of sabers on the road, and I took a
candle to show a light to the men who were returning. They soon
appeared, carrying that inert, soft, long, and sinister object
which a human body becomes when life no longer sustains it.
"They put the wounded man on the mattress that had been prepared
for him, and I saw at the first glance that he was dying. He had
the death rattle, and was spitting up blood which ran out of the
corners of his mouth, forced out of his lungs by his gasps. The
man was covered with it! His cheeks, his beard, his hair, his
neck, and his clothes seemed to have been rubbed, to have been
dipped in a red tub; the blood had congealed on him, and had
become a dull color which was horrible to look at.
"The old man, wrapped up in a large shepherd's cloak,
occasionally opened his dull, vacant eyes. They seemed stupid
with astonishment, like the eyes of hunted animals which fall at
the sportsman's feet, half dead before the shot, stupefied with
fear and surprise.
"The cure exclaimed: 'Ah! there is old Placide, the shepherd from
Les Marlins. He is deaf, poor man, and heard nothing. Ah! Oh,
God! they have killed the unhappy man!' The Sister had opened
his blouse and shirt and was looking at a little blue hole in
the middle of his chest, which was not bleeding any more. 'There
is nothing to be done,' she said.
"The shepherd was gasping terribly and bringing up blood with
every breath. In his throat to the very depth of his lungs, they
could hear an ominous and continued gurgling. The cure, standing
in front of him, raised his right hand, made the sign of the
cross, and in a slow and solemn voice pronounced the Latin words
which purify men's souls. But before they were finished, the old
man was shaken by a rapid shudder, as if something had broken
inside him; he no longer breathed. He was dead.
"When I turned round I saw a sight which was even more horrible
than the death struggle of this unfortunate man. The three old
women were standing up huddled close together, hideous, and
grimacing with fear and horror. I went up to them, and they began
to utter shrill screams, while La Jean-Jean, whose leg had been
burned and could not longer support her, fell to the ground at
full length.
"Sister Saint-Benedict left the dead man, ran up to her infirm
old women, and without a word or a look for me wrapped their
shawls round them, gave them their crutches, pushed them to the
door, made them go out, and disappeared with them into the dark
night.
"I saw that I could not even let a hussar accompany them, for the
mere rattle of a sword would have sent them mad with fear.
"The cure was still looking at the dead man; but at last he
turned to me and said:
" 'Oh! What a horrible thing!' "
SIMON'S PAPA
Noon had just struck. The school-door opened and the youngsters
streamed out tumbling over one another in their haste to get out
quickly. But instead of promptly dispersing and going home to
dinner as was their daily wont, they stopped a few paces off,
broke up into knots and set to whispering.
The fact was that that morning Simon, the son of La Blanchotte,
had, for the first time, attended school.
They had all of them in their families heard of La Blanchotte;
and although in public she was welcome enough, the mothers among
themselves treated her with compassion of a some what disdainful
kind, which the children had caught without in the least knowing
why.
As for Simon himself, they did not know him, for he never went
abroad, and did not play around with them through the streets of
the village or along the banks of the river. So they loved him
but little; and it was with a certain delight, mingled with
astonishment that they gathered in groups this morning, repeating
to each other this sentence, concocted by a lad of fourteen or
fifteen who appeared to know all about it, so sagaciously did he
wink: "You know Simon --well, he has no papa."
La Blanchotte's son appeared in his turn upon the threshold of
the school.
He was seven or eight years old, rather pale, very neat, with a
timid and almost awkward manner.
He was making his way back to his mother's house when the various
groups of his schoolfellows, perpetually whispering, and watching
him with the mischievous and heartless eyes of children bent upon
playing a nasty trick, gradually surrounded him and ended by
inclosing him altogether. There he stood amid them, surprised and
embarrassed, not understanding what they were going to do with
him. But the lad who had brought the news, puffed up with the
success he had met with, demanded:
"What do you call yourself?"
He answered: "Simon."
"Simon what?" retorted the other.
The child, altogether bewildered, repeated: "Simon."
The lad shouted at him: "You must be named Simon something! That
is not a name--Simon indeed!"
And he, on the brink of tears, replied for the third time:
"I am named Simon."
The urchins began laughing. The lad triumphantly lifted up his
voice: "You can see plainly that he has no papa."
A deep silence ensued. The children were dumfounded by this
extraordinary, impossibly monstrous thing--a boy who had not a
papa; they looked upon him as a phenomenon, an unnatural being,
and they felt rising in them the hitherto inexplicable pity of
their mothers for La Blanchotte. As for Simon, he had propped
himself against a tree to avoid falling, and he stood there as if
paralyzed by an irreparable disaster. He sought to explain, but
he could think of no answer for them, no way to deny this
horrible charge that he had no papa. At last he shouted at them
quite recklessly: "Yes, I have one."
"Where is he?" demanded the boy.
Simon was silent, he did not know. The children shrieked,
tremendously excited. These sons of toil, nearly related to
animals, experienced the cruel craving which makes the fowls of a
farmyard destroy one of their own kind as soon as it is wounded.
Simon suddenly spied a little neighbor, the son of a widow, whom
he had always seen, as he himself was to be seen, quite alone
with his mother.
"And no more have you," he said, "no more have you a papa."
"Yes," replied the other, "I have one."
"Where is he?" rejoined Simon.
"He is dead," declared the brat with superb dignity, "he is in
the cemetery, is my papa."
A murmur of approval rose amid the scape-graces, as if the fact
of possessing a papa dead in a cemetery made their comrade big
enough to crush the other one who had no papa at all. And these
rogues, whose fathers were for the most part evil-doers,
drunkards, thieves, and ill-treaters of their wives hustled each
other as they pressed closer and closer to Simon as though they,
the legitimate ones, would stifle in their pressure one who was
beyond the law.
The lad next Simon suddenly put his tongue out at him with a
waggish air and shouted at him:
"No papa! No papa!"
Simon seized him by the hair with both hands and set to work to
demolish his legs with kicks, while he bit his cheek ferociously.
A tremendous struggle ensued between the two boys, and Simon
found himself beaten, torn, bruised, rolled on the ground in the
middle of the ring of applauding little vagabonds. As he arose,
mechanically brushing his little blouse all covered with dust
with his hand, some one shouted at him:
"Go and tell your papa."
He then felt a great sinking in his heart. They were stronger
than he, they had beaten him and he had no answer to give them,
for he knew it was true that he had no papa. Full of pride he
tried for some moments to struggle against the tears which were
suffocating him. He had a choking fit, and then without cries he
began to weep with great sobs which shook him incessantly. Then a
ferocious joy broke out among his enemies, and, just like savages
in fearful festivals, they took one another by the hand and
danced in a circle about him as they repeated in refrain:
"No papa! No papa!"
But suddenly Simon ceased sobbing. Frenzy overtook him. There
were stones under his feet; he picked them up and with all his
strength hurled them at his tormentors. Two or three were struck
and ran away yelling, and so formidable did he appear that the
rest became panic-stricken. Cowards, like a jeering crowd in the
presence of an exasperated man, they broke up and fled. Left
alone, the little thing without a father set off running toward
the fields, for a recollection had been awakened which nerved his
soul to a great determination. He made up his mind to drown
himself in the river.
He remembered, in fact, that eight days ago a poor devil who
begged for his livelihood had thrown himself into the water
because he had no more money. Simon had been there when they
fished him out again, and the sight of the fellow, who had seemed
to him so miserable and ugly, had then impressed him--his pale
cheeks, his long drenched beard, and his open eyes being full of
calm. The bystanders had said:
"He is dead."
And some one had added:
"He is quite happy now."
So Simon wished to drown himself also because he had no father,
just as the wretched being did who had no money.
He reached the water and watched it flowing. Some fishes were
rising briskly in the clear stream and occasionally made little
leaps and caught the flies on the surface. He stopped crying in
order to watch them, for their feeding interested him vastly.
But, at intervals, as in the lulls of a tempest, when tremendous
gusts of wind snap off trees and then die away, this thought
would return to him with intense pain:
"I am about to drown myself because I have no papa."
It was very warm and fine weather. The pleasant sunshine warmed
the grass; the water shone like a mirror; and Simon enjoyed for
some minutes the happiness of that languor which follows weeping,
desirous even of falling asleep there upon the grass in the
warmth of noon.
A little green frog leaped from under his feet. He endeavored to
catch it. It escaped him. He pursued it and lost it three times
following. At last he caught it by one of its hind legs and began
to laugh as he saw the efforts the creature made to escape. It
gathered itself up on its large legs and then with a violent
spring suddenly stretched them out as stiff as two bars.
Its eyes stared wide open in their round, golden circle, and it
beat the air with its front limbs, using them as though they were
hands. It reminded him of a toy made with straight slips of wood
nailed zig-zag one on the other, which by a similar movement
regulated the exercise of the little soldiers fastened thereon.
Then he thought of his home and of his mother, and overcome by
great sorrow he again began to weep. His limbs trembled; and he
placed himself on his knees and said his prayers as before going
to bed. But he was unable to finish them, for such hurried and
violent sobs overtook him that he was completely overwhelmed. He
thought no more, he no longer heeded anything around him but was
wholly given up to tears.
Suddenly a heavy hand was placed upon his shoulder, and a rough
voice asked him:
"What is it that causes you so much grief, my fine fellow?"
Simon turned round. A tall workman, with a black beard and hair
all curled, was staring at him good-naturedly. He answered with
his eyes and throat full of tears:
"They have beaten me because--I--I have no papa--no papa. "
"What!" said the man smiling, "why, everybody has one."
The child answered painfully amid his spasms of grief:
"But I--I--I have none."
Then the workman became serious. He had recognized La
Blanchotte's son, and although a recent arrival to the
neighborhood he had a vague idea of her history.
"Well," said he, "console yourself, my boy, and come with me home
to your mother. She will give you a papa."
And so they started on the way, the big one holding the little
one by the hand. The man smiled afresh, for he was not sorry to
see this Blanchotte, who by popular report was one of the
prettiest girls in the country-side--and, perhaps, he said to
himself, at the bottom of his heart, that a lass who had erred
once might very well err again.
They arrived in front of a very neat little white house.
"There it is," exclaimed the child, and he cried: "Mamma."
A woman appeared, and the workman instantly left off smiling, for
he at once perceived that there was no more fooling to be done
with the tall pale girl, who stood austerely at her door as
though to defend from one man the threshold of that house where she
had already been betrayed by another. Intimidated, his cap in his
hand, he stammered out:
"See, Madame, I have brought you back your little boy, who had
lost himself near the river."
But Simon flung his arms about his mother's neck and told her, as
he again began to cry:
"No, mamma, I wished to drown myself, because the others had
beaten me--had beaten me--because I have no papa."
A burning redness covered the young woman's cheeks, and, hurt to
the quick, she embraced her child passionately, while the tears
coursed down her face. The man, much moved, stood there, not
knowing how to get away. But Simon suddenly ran to him and said:
"Will you be my papa?"
A deep silence ensued. La Blanchotte, dumb and tortured with
shame, leaned against the wall, her hands upon her heart. The
child, seeing that no answer was made him, replied:
"If you do not wish it, I shall return to drown myself."
The workman took the matter as a jest and answered laughing:
"Why, yes, I wish it certainly."
"What is your name, then," went on the child, "so that I may tell
the others when they wish to know your name?"
"Philip," answered the man.
Simon was silent a moment so that he might get the name well into
his memory; then he stretched out his arms, quite consoled, and
said:
"Well, then, Philip, you are my papa."
The workman, lifting him from the ground, kissed him hastily on
both cheeks, and then strode away quickly.
When the child returned to school next day he was received with a
spiteful laugh, and at the end of school, when the lads were on
the point of recommencing, Simon threw these words at their heads
as he would have done a stone: "He is named Philip, my papa."
Yells of delight burst out from all sides.
"Philip who? Philip what? What on earth is Philip? Where did you
pick up your Philip?"
Simon answered nothing; and immovable in faith he defied them
with his eye, ready to be martyred rather than fly before them.
The schoolmaster came to his rescue and he returned home to his
mother.
For a space of three months, the tall workman, Philip, frequently
passed by La Blanchotte's house, and sometimes made bold to speak
to her when he saw her sewing near the window. She answered him
civilly, always sedately, never joking with him, nor permitting
him to enter her house. Notwithstanding this, being, like all
men, a bit of a coxcomb, he imagined that she was often rosier
than usual when she chatted with him.
But a fallen reputation is so difficult to recover, and always
remains so fragile that, in spite of the shy reserve La
Blanchotte maintained, they already gossiped in the neighborhood.
As for Simon, he loved his new papa much, and walked with him
nearly every evening when the day's work was done. He went
regularly to school and mixed in a dignified way with his
schoolfellows without ever answering them back.
One day, however, the lad who had first attacked him said to him:
"You have lied. You have not a papa named Philip."
"Why do you say that?" demanded Simon, much disturbed.
The youth rubbed his hands. He replied:
"Because if you had one he would be your mamma's husband."
Simon was confused by the truth of this reasoning; nevertheless
he retorted:
"He is my papa all the same."
"That can very well be," exclaimed the urchin with a sneer, "but
that is not being your papa altogether."
La Blanchotte's little one bowed his head and went off dreaming
in the direction of the forge belonging to old Loizon, where
Philip worked.
This forge was entombed in trees. It was very dark there, the red
glare of a formidable furnace alone lit up with great flashes
five blacksmiths, who hammered upon their anvils with a terrible
din. Standing enveloped in flame, they worked like demons, their
eyes fixed on the red-hot iron they were pounding; and their dull
ideas rising and falling with their hammers.
Simon entered without being noticed and quietly plucked his
friend by the sleeve. Philip turned round. All at once the work
came to a standstill and the men looked on very attentively.
Then, in the midst of this unaccustomed silence, rose the little
slender pipe of Simon:
"Philip, explain to me what the lad at La Michande has just told
me, that you are not altogether my papa."
"And why that?" asked the smith.
The child replied in all innocence:
"Because you are not my mamma's husband."
No one laughed. Philip remained standing, leaning his forehead
upon the back of his great hands, which held the handle of his
hammer upright upon the anvil. He mused. His four companions
watched him, and, like a tiny mite among these giants, Simon
anxiously waited. Suddenly, one of the smiths, voicing the
sentiment of all, said to Philip:
"All the same La Blanchotte is a good and honest girl, stalwart
and steady in spite of her misfortune, and one who would make a
worthy wife for an honest man."
"That is true," remarked the three others. The smith continued:
"Is it the girl's fault if she has fallen? She had been promised
marriage, and I know more than one who is much respected to-day
and has sinned every bit as much."
"That is true," responded the three men in chorus.
He resumed:
"How hard she has toiled, poor thing, to educate her lad all
alone, and how much she has wept since she no longer goes out,
save to church, God only knows."
"That also is true," said the others.
Then no more was heard save the roar of the bellows which fanned
the fire of the furnace. Philip hastily bent himself down to
Simon:
"Go and tell your mamma that I shall come to speak to her."
Then he pushed the child out by the shoulders. He returned to his
work and in unison the five hammers again fell upon their anvils.
Thus they wrought the iron until nightfall, strong, powerful,
happy, like Vulcans satisfied. But as the great bell of a
cathedral resounds upon feast days above the jingling of the
other bells, so Philip's hammer, dominating the noise of the
others, clanged second after second with a deafening uproar. His
eye on the fire, he plied his trade vigorously, erect amid the
sparks.
The sky was full of stars as he knocked at La Blanchotte's door.
He had his Sunday blouse on, a fresh shirt, and his beard was
trimmed. The young woman showed herself upon the threshold and
said in a grieved tone:
"It is ill to come thus when night has fallen, Mr. Philip."
He wished to answer, but stammered and stood confused before her.
She resumed:
"And you understand quite well that it will not do that I should
be talked about any more."
Then he said all at once:
"What does that matter to me, if you will be my wife!"
No voice replied to him, but he believed that he heard in the
shadow of the room the sound of a body falling. He entered very
quickly; and Simon, who had gone to his bed, distinguished the
sound of a kiss and some words that his mother said very softly.
Then he suddenly found himself lifted up by the hands of his
friend, who, holding him at the length of his herculean arms,
exclaimed to him:
"You will tell your school-fellows that your papa is Philip Remy,
the blacksmith, and that he will pull the ears of all who do you
any harm."
On the morrow, when the school was full and lessons were about to
begin, little Simon stood up quite pale with trembling lips:
"My papa," said he in a clear voice, "is Philip Remy, the
blacksmith, and he has promised to box the ears of all who do me
any harm."
This time no one laughed any longer, for he was very well known,
was Philip Remy, the blacksmith, and he was a papa of whom anyone
in the world would be proud.
WAITER, A "BOCK"[1]
[1] Bavarian beer.
Why on this particular evening, did I enter a certain beer shop?
I cannot explain it. It was bitterly cold. A fine rain, a watery
mist floated about, veiling the gas jets in a transparent fog,
making the pavements under the shadow of the shop fronts glitter,
which revealed the soft slush and the soiled feet of the
passers-by.
I was going nowhere in particular; was simply having a short walk
after dinner. I had passed the Credit Lyonnais, the Rue Vivienne,
and several other streets. Suddenly I descried a large cafe,
which was more than half full. I walked inside, with no object in
mind. I was not the least thirsty.
By a searching glance I detected a place where I would not be too
much crowded. So I went and sat down by the side of a man who
seemed to me to be old, and who smoked a half-penny clay pipe,
which  had become as black as coal. From six to eight beer
saucers were piled up on the table in front of him, indicating
the number of "bocks" he had already absorbed. With that same
glance I had recognized in him a "regular toper," one of those
frequenters of beer-houses, who come in the morning as soon as
the place is open, and only go away in the evening when it is
about to close. He was dirty, bald to about the middle of the
cranium, while his long gray hair fell over the neck of his frock
coat. His clothes, much too large for him, appeared to have been
made for him at a time when he was very stout. One could guess
that his pantaloons were not held up by braces, and that this man
could not take ten paces without having to pull them up and
readjust them. Did he wear a vest? The mere thought of his boots
and the feet they enveloped filled me with horror. The frayed
cuffs were as black at the edges as were his nails.
As soon as I had sat down near him, this queer creature said to
me in a tranquil tone of voice:
"How goes it with you?"
I turned sharply round to him and closely scanned his features,
whereupon he continued:
"I see you do not recognize me."
"No, I do not."
"Des Barrets."
I was stupefied. It was Count Jean des Barrets, my old college
chum.
I seized him by the hand, so dumfounded that I could find nothing
to say. I, at length, managed to stammer out:
"And you, how goes it with you?"
He responded placidly:
"With me? Just as I like."
He became silent. I wanted to be friendly, and I selected this
phrase:
"What are you doing now?"
"You see what I am doing," he answered, quite resignedly.
I felt my face getting red. I insisted:
"But every day?"
"Every day is alike to me," was his response, accompanied with a
thick puff of tobacco smoke.
He then tapped on the top of the marble table with a sou, to
attract the attention of the waiter, and called out:
"Waiter, two 'bocks.' "
A voice in the distance repeated:
"Two 'bocks,' instead of four."
Another voice, more distant still, shouted out:
"Here they are, sir, here they are."
Immediately there appeared a man with a white apron, carrying two
'bocks,' which he set down foaming on the table, the foam running
over the edge, on to the sandy floor.
Des Barrets emptied his glass at a single draught and replaced it
on the table, sucking in the drops of beer that had been left on
his mustache. He next asked:
"What is there new?"
"I know of nothing new, worth mentioning, really," I stammered:
"But nothing has grown old for me; I am a commercial man."
In an equable tone of voice, he said:
"Indeed--does that amuse you?"
"No, but what do you mean by that? Surely you must do something!"
"What do you mean by that?"
"I only mean, how do you pass your time!"
"What's the use of occupying myself with anything. For my part, I
do nothing at all, as you see, never anything. When one has not
got a sou one can understand why one has to go to work. What is
the good of working? Do you work for yourself, or for others? If
you work for yourself you do it for your own amusement, which is
all right; if you work for others, you reap nothing but
ingratitude."
Then sticking his pipe into his mouth, he called out anew:
"Waiter, a 'bock.' It makes me thirsty to keep calling so. I am
not accustomed to that sort of thing. Yes, I do nothing; I let
things slide, and I am growing old. In dying I shall have nothing
to regret. If so, I should remember nothing, outside this
public-house. I have no wife, no children, no cares, no sorrows,
nothing. That is the very best thing that could happen to one."
He then emptied the glass which had been brought him, passed his
tongue over his lips, and resumed his pipe.
I looked at him stupefied and asked him:
"But you have not always been like that?"
"Pardon me, sir; ever since I left college."
"It is not a proper life to lead, my dear sir; it is simply
horrible. Come, you must indeed have done something, you must
have loved something, you must have friends."
"No; I get up at noon, I come here, I have my breakfast, I drink
my 'bock'; I remain until the evening, I have my dinner, I drink
'bock.' Then about one in the morning, I return to my couch,
because the place closes up. And it is this latter that embitters
me more than anything. For the last ten years, I have passed
six-tenths of my time on this bench, in my corner; and the other
four-tenths in my bed, never changing. I talk sometimes with the
habitues."
"But on arriving in Paris what did you do at first?"
"I paid my devoirs to the Cafe de Medicis."
"What next?"
"Next? I crossed the water and came here."
"Why did you take even that trouble?"
"What do you mean? One cannot remain all one's life in the Latin
Quarter. The students make too much noise. But I do not move
about any longer. Waiter, a 'bock.' "
I now began to think that he was making fun of me, and I
continued:
"Come now, be frank. You have been the victim of some great
sorrow; despair in love, no doubt! It is easy to see that you are
a man whom misfortune has hit hard. What age are you?"
"I am thirty years of age, but I look to be forty-five at least."
I looked him straight in the face. His shrunken figure, badly
cared for, gave one the impression that he was an old man. On the
summit of his cranium, a few long hairs shot straight up from a
skin of doubtful cleanness. He had enormous eyelashes, a large
mustache, and a thick beard. Suddenly I had a kind of vision, I
know not why--the vision of a basin filled with noisome water,
the water which should have been applied to that poll. I said to
him:
"Verily, you look to be more than that age. Of a certainty you
must have experienced some great disappointment."
He replied:
"I tell you that I have not. I am old because I never take air.
There is nothing that vitiates the life of a man more than the
atmosphere of a cafe." I could not believe him.
"You must surely have been married as well? One could not get as
baldheaded as you are without having been much in love."
He shook his head, sending down his back little hairs from the
scalp:
"No, I have always been virtuous."
And raising his eyes toward the luster, which beat down on our
heads, he said:
"If I am baldheaded, it is the fault of the gas. It is the enemy
of hair. Waiter, a 'bock.' You must be thirsty also?"
"No, thank you. But you certainly interest me. When did you have
your first discouragement? Your life is not normal, is not
natural. There is something under it all."
"Yes, and it dates from my infancy. I received a heavy blow when
I was very young. It turned my life into darkness, which will
last to the end."
"How did it come about?"
"You wish to know about it? Well, then, listen. You recall, of
course, the castle in which I was brought up, seeing that you
used to visit it for five or six months during the vacations? You
remember that large, gray building in the middle of a great park,
and the long avenues of oaks, which opened toward the four
cardinal points! You remember my father and my mother, both of
whom were ceremonious, solemn, and severe.
"I worshiped my mother; I was suspicious of my father; but I
respected both, accustomed always as I was to see everyone bow
before them. In the country, they were Monsieur le Comte and
Madame la Comtesse; and our neighbors, the Tannemares, the
Ravelets, the Brennevilles, showed the utmost consideration for
them.
"I was then thirteen years old, happy, satisfied with everything,
as one is at that age, and full of joy and vivacity.
"Now toward the end of September, a few days before entering the
Lycee, while I was enjoying myself in the mazes of the park,
climbing the trees and swinging on the branches, I saw crossing
an avenue my father and mother, who were walking together.
"I recall the thing as though it were yesterday. It was a very
windy day. The whole line of trees bent under the pressure of the
wind, moaned and seemed to utter cries--cries dull, yet deep--so
that the whole forest groaned under the gale.
"Evening had come on, and it was dark in the thickets. The
agitation of the wind and the branches excited me, made me skip
about like an idiot, and howl in imitation of the wolves.
"As soon as I perceived my parents, I crept furtively toward
them, under the branches, in order to surprise them, as though I
had been a veritable wolf. But suddenly seized with fear, I
stopped a few paces from them. My father, a prey to the most
violent passion, cried:
" 'Your mother is a fool; moreover, it is not your mother that is
the question, it is you. I tell you that I want money, and I will
make you sign this.'
"My mother responded in a firm voice:
" 'I will not sign it. It is Jean's fortune, I shall guard it for
him and I will not allow you to devour it with strange women, as
you have your own heritage.'
"Then my father, full of rage, wheeled round and seized his wife
by the throat, and began to slap her full in the face with the
disengaged hand.
"My mother's hat fell off, her hair became disheveled and fell
down her back: she essayed to parry the blows, but could not
escape from them. And my father, like a madman, banged and banged
at her. My mother rolled over on the ground, covering her face in
both her hands. Then he turned her over on her back in order to
batter her still more, pulling away the hands which were covering
her face.
"As for me, my friend, it seemed as though the world had come to
an end, that the eternal laws had changed. I experienced the
overwhelming dread that one has in presence of things
supernatural, in presence of irreparable disaster. My boyish head
whirled round and soared. I began to cry with all my might,
without knowing why, a prey to terror, to grief, to a dreadful
bewilderment. My father heard me, turned round, and, on seeing
me, made as though he would rush at me. I believed that he wanted
to kill me, and I fled like a hunted animal, running straight in
front of me through the woods.
"I ran perhaps for an hour, perhaps for two, I know not. Darkness
had set in, I tumbled over some thick herbs, exhausted, and I lay
there lost, devoured by terror, eaten up by a sorrow capable of
breaking forever the heart of a child. I became cold, I became
hungry. At length day broke. I dared neither get up, walk, return
home, nor save myself, fearing to encounter my father whom I did
not wish to see again.
"I should probably have died of misery and of hunger at the foot
of a tree if the guard had not discovered me and led me away by
force.
"I found my parents wearing their ordinary aspect. My mother
alone spoke to me:
" 'How you have frightened me, you naughty boy; I have been the
whole night sleepless.'
"I did not answer, but began to weep. My father did not utter a
single word.
"Eight days later I entered the Lycee.
"Well, my friend, it was all over with me. I had witnessed the
other side of things, the bad side; I have not been able to
perceive the good side since that day. What things have passed in
my mind, what strange phenomena have warped my ideas, I do not
know. But I no longer have a taste for anything, a wish for
anything, a love for anybody, a desire for anything whatever, no
ambition, no hope. And I can always see my poor mother lying on
the ground, in the avenue, while my father was maltreating her.
My mother died a few years after; my father lives still. I have
not seen him since. Waiter, a 'bock.' "
A waiter brought him his "bock," which he swallowed at a gulp.
But, in taking up his pipe again, trembling as he was, he broke
it. Then he made a violent gesture:
"Zounds! This is indeed a grief, a real grief. I have had it for
a month, and it was coloring so beautifully!"
Then he went off through the vast saloon, which was now full of
smoke and of people drinking, calling out:
"Waiter, a 'bock'--and a new pipe."
SEQUEL TO A DIVORCE
Certainly, although he had been engaged in the most
extraordinary, most unlikely, most extravagant, and funniest
cases, and had won legal games without a trump in his
hand--although he had worked out the obscure law of divorce, as
if it had been a Californian gold mine, Maitre[1] Garrulier, the
celebrated, the only Garrulier, could not check a movement of
surprise, nor a disheartening shake of the head, nor a smile,
when the Countess de Baudemont explained her affairs to him for
the first time.
[1] Title given to advocates in France.
He had just opened his correspondence, and his slender hands, on
which he bestowed the greatest attention, buried themselves in a
heap of female letters, and one might have thought oneself in the
confessional of a fashionable preacher, so impregnated was the
atmosphere with delicate perfumes.
Immediately--even before she had said a word--with the sharp
glance of a practised man of the world, that look which made
beautiful Madame de Serpenoise say: "He strips your heart bare!"
the lawyer had classed her in the third category. Those who
suffer came into his first category, those who love, into the
second, and those who are bored, into the third--and she belonged
to the latter.
She was a pretty windmill, whose sails turned and flew round, and
fretted the blue sky with a delicious shiver of joy, as it were,
and had the brain of a bird, in which four correct and healthy
ideas cannot exist side by side, and in which all dreams and
every kind of folly are engulfed, like a great kaleidoscope.
Incapable of hurting a fly, emotional, charitable, with a feeling
of tenderness for the street girl who sells bunches of violets
for a penny, for a cab horse which a driver is ill-using, for a
melancholy pauper's funeral, when the body, without friends or
relations to follow it, is being conveyed to the common grave,
doing anything that might afford five minutes' amusement, not
caring if she made men miserable for the rest of their days, and
taking pleasure in kindling passions which consumed men's whole
being, looking upon life as too short to be anything else than
one uninterrupted round of gaiety and enjoyment, she thought that
people might find plenty of time for being serious and reasonable
in the evening of life, when they are at the bottom of the hill,
and their looking-glasses reveal a wrinkled face, surrounded with
white hair.
A thorough-bred Parisian, whom one would follow to the end of the
world, like a poodle; a woman whom one adores with the head, the
heart, and the senses until one is nearly driven mad, as soon as
one has inhaled the delicate perfume that emanates from her dress
and hair, or touched her skin, and heard her laugh; a woman for
whom one would fight a duel and risk one's life without a
thought; for whom a man would remove mountains, and sell his soul
to the devil several times over, if the devil were still in the
habit of frequenting the places of bad repute on this earth.
She had perhaps come to see this Garrulier, whom she had so often
heard mentioned at five o'clock teas, so as to be able to
describe him to her female friends subsequently in droll phrases,
imitating his gestures and the unctuous inflections of his voice,
in order, perhaps, to experience some new sensation, or, perhaps,
for the sake of dressing like a woman who was going to try for a
divorce; and, certainly, the whole effect was perfect. She wore a
splendid cloak embroidered with jet--which gave an almost serious
effect to her golden hair, to her small slightly turned-up nose,
with its quivering nostrils, and to her large eyes, full of
enigma and fun--over a dark stuff dress, which was fastened at
the neck by a sapphire and a diamond pin.
The barrister did not interrupt her, but allowed her to get
excited and to chatter; to enumerate her causes for complaint
against poor Count de Baudemont, who certainly had no suspicion
of his wife's escapade, and who would have been very much
surprised if anyone had told him of it at that moment, when he
was taking his fencing lesson at the club.
When she had quite finished, he said coolly, as if he were
throwing a pail of water on some burning straw:
"But, Madame, there is not the slightest pretext for a divorce in
anything that you have told me here. The judges would ask me
whether I took the Law Courts for a theater, and intended to make
fun of them."
And seeing how disheartened she was,--that she looked like a
child whose favorite toy had been broken, that she was so pretty
that he would have liked to kiss her hands in his devotion, and
as she seemed to be witty, and very amusing, and as, moreover, he
had no objection to such visits being prolonged, when papers had
to be looked over, while sitting close together,--Maitre
Garrulier appeared to be considering. Taking his chin in his
hand, he said:
"However, I will think it over; there is sure to be some dark
spot that can be made out worse. Write to me, and come and see me
again."
In the course of her visits, that black spot had increased so
much and Madame de Baudemont had followed her lawyer's advice so
punctually, and had played on the various strings so skillfully
that a few months later, after a lawsuit, which is still spoken
of in the Courts of Justice, and during the course of which the
President had to take off his spectacles, and to use his
pocket-handkerchief noisily, the divorce was pronounced in favor
of the Countess Marie Anne Nicole Bournet de Baudemont, nee de
Tanchart de Peothus.
The Count, who was nonplussed at such an adventure turning out so
seriously, first of all flew into a terrible rage, rushed off to
the lawyer's office and threatened to cut off his knavish ears
for him. But when his access of fury was over, and he thought of
it, he shrugged his shoulders and said:
"All the better for her, if it amuses her!"
Then he bought Baron Silberstein's yacht, and with some friends,
got up a cruise to Ceylon and India.
Marie Anne began by triumphing, and felt as happy as a schoolgirl
going home for the holidays; she committed every possible folly,
and soon, tired, satiated, and disgusted, began to yawn, cried,
and found out that she had sacrificed her happiness, like a
millionaire who has gone mad and has cast his banknotes and
shares into the river, and that she was nothing more than a
disabled waif and stray. Consequently, she now married again, as
the solitude of her home made her morose from morning till night;
and then, besides, she found a woman requires a mansion when she
goes into society, to race meetings, or to the theater.
And so, while she became a marchioness, and pronounced her second
"Yes," before a very few friends, at the office of the mayor of
the English urban district, malicious people in the Faubourg were
making fun of the whole affair, and affirming this and that,
whether rightly or wrongly, and comparing the present husband to
the former one, even declaring that he had partially been the
cause of the former divorce. Meanwhile Monsieur de Baudemont was
wandering over the four quarters of the globe trying to overcome
his homesickness, and to deaden his longing for love, which had
taken possession of his heart and of his body, like a slow
poison.
He traveled through the most out-of-the-way places, and the most
lovely countries, and spent months and months at sea, and plunged
into every kind of dissipation and debauchery. But neither the
supple forms nor the luxurious gestures of the bayaderes, nor the
large passive eyes of the Creoles, nor flirtations with English
girls with hair the color of new cider, nor nights of waking
dreams, when he saw new constellations in the sky, nor dangers
during which a man thinks it is all over with him, and mutters a
few words of prayer in spite of himself, when the waves are high,
and the sky black, nothing was able to make him forget that
little Parisian woman who smelled so sweet that she might have
been taken for a bouquet of rare flowers; who was so coaxing, so
curious, so funny; who never had the same caprice, the same
smile, or the same look twice, and who, at bottom, was worth more
than many others, either saints or sinners.
He thought of her constantly, during long hours of sleeplessness.
He carried her portrait about with him in the breast pocket of
his pea-jacket--a charming portrait in which she was smiling, and
showing her white teeth between her half-open lips. Her gentle
eyes with their magnetic look had a happy, frank expression, and
from the mere arrangement of her hair, one could see that she was
fair among the fair.
He used to kiss that portrait of the woman who had been his wife
as if he wished to efface it, would look at it for hours, and
then throw himself down on the netting and sob like a child as he
looked at the infinite expanse before him, seeming to see their
lost happiness, the joys of their perished affections, and the
divine remembrance of their love, in the monotonous waste of
green waters. And he tried to accuse himself for all that had
occurred, and not to be angry with her, to think that his
grievances were imaginary, and to adore her in spite of
everything and always.
And so he roamed about the world, tossed to and fro, suffering
and hoping he knew not what. He ventured into the greatest
dangers, and sought for death just as a man seeks for his
mistress, and death passed close to him without touching him,
perhaps amused at his grief and misery.
For he was as wretched as a stone-breaker, as one of those poor
devils who work and nearly break their backs over the hard flints
the whole day long, under the scorching sun or the cold rain; and
Marie Anne herself was not happy, for she was pining for the past
and remembered their former love.
At last, however, he returned to France, changed, tanned by
exposure, sun, and rain, and transformed as if by some witch's
philter.
Nobody would have recognized the elegant and effeminate clubman,
in this corsair with broad shoulders, a skin the color of tan,
with very red lips, who rolled a little in his walk; who seemed
to be stifled in his black dress-coat, but who still retained the
distinguished manners and bearing of a nobleman of the last
century, one of those who, when he was ruined, fitted out a
privateer, and fell upon the English wherever he met them, from
St. Malo to Calcutta. And wherever he showed himself his friends
exclaimed:
"Why! Is that you? I should never have known you again!"
He was very nearly starting off again immediately; he even
telegraphed orders to Havre to get the steam-yacht ready for sea
directly, when he heard that Marie Anne had married again.
He saw her in the distance, at the Theatre Francais one Tuesday,
and when he noticed how pretty, how fair, how desirable she
was,--looking so melancholy, with all the appearance of an
unhappy soul that regrets something,--his determination grew
weaker, and he delayed his departure from week to week, and
waited, without knowing why, until, at last, worn out with the
struggle, watching her wherever she went, more in love with her
than he had ever been before, he wrote her long, mad, ardent
letters in which his passion overflowed like a stream of lava.
He altered his handwriting, as he remembered her restless brain,
and her many whims. He sent her the flowers which he knew she
liked best, and told her that she was his life, that he was dying
of waiting for her, of longing for her, for her his idol.
At last, very much puzzled and surprised, guessing--who
knows?--from the instinctive beating of her heart, and her
general emotion, that it must be he this time, he whose soul she
had tortured with such cold cruelty, and knowing that she could
make amends for the past and bring back their former love, she
replied to him, and granted him the meeting that he asked for.
She fell into his arms, and they both sobbed with joy and
ecstasy. Their kisses were those which lips give only when they
have lost each other and found each other again at last, when
they meet and exhaust themselves in each other's looks, thirsting
for tenderness, love, and enjoyment.
 * * * * * * *
Last week Count de Baudemont carried off Marie Anne quietly and
coolly, just like one resumes possession of one's house on
returning from a journey, and drives out the intruders. And when
Maitre Garrulier was told of this unheard of scandal, he rubbed
his hands--the long, delicate hands of a sensual prelate--and
exclaimed:
"That is absolutely logical, and I should like to be in their
place."
THE MAD WOMAN
"I can tell you a terrible story about the Franco-Prussian war,"
Monsieur d'Endolin said to some friends assembled in the
smoking-room of Baron de Ravot's chateau. "You know my house in
the Faubourg de Cormeil, I was living there when the Prussians
came, and I had for a neighbor a kind of mad woman, who had lost
her senses in consequence of a series of misfortunes. At the age
of seven and twenty she had lost her father, her husband, and her
newly born child, all in the space of a month.
"When death has once entered into a house, it almost invariably
returns immediately, as if it knew the way, and the young woman,
overwhelmed with grief, took to her bed and was delirious for six
weeks. Then a species of calm lassitude succeeded that violent
crisis, and she remained motionless, eating next to nothing, and
only moving her eyes. Every time they tried to make her get up,
she screamed as if they were about to kill her, and so they ended
by leaving her continually in bed, and only taking her out to
wash her, to change her linen, and to turn her mattress.
"An old servant remained with her, to give her something to
drink, or a little cold meat, from time to time. What passed in
that despairing mind? No one ever knew, for she did not speak at
all now. Was she thinking of the dead? Was she dreaming sadly,
without any precise recollection of anything that had happened?
Or was her memory as stagnant as water without any current? But
however this may have been, for fifteen years she remained thus
inert and secluded.
"The war broke out, and in the beginning of December the Germans
came to Cormeil. I can remember it as if it were but yesterday.
It was freezing hard enough to split the stones, and I myself was
lying back in an armchair, being unable to move on account of the
gout, when I heard their heavy and regular tread, and could see
them pass from my window.
"They defiled past interminably, with that peculiar motion of a
puppet on wires, which belongs to them. Then the officers
billeted their men on the inhabitants, and I had seventeen of
them. My neighbor, the crazy woman, had a dozen, one of whom was
the Commandant, a regular violent, surly swashbuckler.
"During the first few days, everything went on as usual. The
officers next door had been told that the lady was ill, and they
did not trouble themselves about that in the least, but soon that
woman whom they never saw irritated them. They asked what
her illness was, and were told that she had been in bed for
fifteen years, in consequence of terrible grief. No doubt they
did not believe it, and thought that the poor mad creature would
not leave her bed out of pride, so that she might not come near
the Prussians, or speak to them or even see them.
"The Commandant insisted upon her receiving him. He was shown
into the room and said to her roughly: 'I must beg you to get up,
Madame, and to come downstairs so that we may all see you.' But
she merely turned her vague eyes on him, without replying, and so
he continued: 'I do not intend to tolerate any insolence, and if
you do not get up of your own accord, I can easily find means to
make you walk without any assistance.'
"But she did not give any signs of having heard him, and remained
quite motionless. Then he got furious, taking that calm silence
for a mark of supreme contempt; so he added: 'If you do not come
downstairs to-morrow--' And then he left the room.
"The next day the terrified old servant wished to dress her, but
the mad woman began to scream violently, and resisted with all
her might. The officer ran upstairs quickly, and the servant
threw herself at his feet and cried: 'She will not come down,
Monsieur, she will not. Forgive her, for she is so unhappy.'
"The soldier was embarrassed, as in spite of his anger, he did
not venture to order his soldiers to drag her out. But suddenly
he began to laugh, and gave some orders in German, and soon a
party of soldiers was seen coming out supporting a mattress as if
they were carrying a wounded man. On that bed, which had not been
unmade, the mad woman, who was still silent, was lying quite
quietly, for she was quite indifferent to anything that went on,
as long as they let her lie. Behind her, a soldier was carrying a
parcel of feminine attire, and the officer said, rubbing his
hands: 'We will just see whether you cannot dress yourself alone,
and take a little walk.'
"And then the procession went off in the direction of the forest
of Imauville; in two hours the soldiers came back alone, and
nothing more was seen of the mad woman. What had they done with
her? Where had they taken her to? No one knew.
"The snow was falling day and night, and enveloped the plain and
the woods in a shroud of frozen foam, and the wolves came and
howled at our very doors.
"The thought of that poor lost woman haunted me, and I made
several applications to the Prussian authorities in order to
obtain some information, and was nearly shot for doing so. When
spring returned, the army of occupation withdrew, but my
neighbor's house remained closed, and the grass grew thick in the
garden walks. The old servant had died during the winter, and
nobody troubled any longer about the occurrence; I alone thought
about it constantly. What had they done with the woman? Had she
escaped through the forest? Had somebody found her, and taken her
to a hospital, without being able to obtain any information from
her? Nothing happened to relieve my doubts; but by degrees, time
assuaged my fears.
"Well, in the following autumn the woodcock were very plentiful,
and as my gout had left me for a time, I dragged myself as far as
the forest. I had already killed four or five of the long-billed
birds, when I knocked over one which fell into a ditch full of
branches, and I was obliged to get into it, in order to pick it
up, and I found that it had fallen close to a dead, human body.
Immediately the recollection of the mad woman struck me like a
blow in the chest. Many other people had perhaps died in the wood
during that disastrous year, but though I do not know why, I was
sure, sure, I tell you, that I should see the head of that
wretched maniac.
"And suddenly I understood, I guessed everything. They had
abandoned her on that mattress in the cold, deserted wood; and,
faithful to her fixed idea, she had allowed herself to perish
under that thick and light counterpane of snow, without moving
either arms or legs.
"Then the wolves had devoured her, and the birds had built their
nests with the wool from her torn bed, and I took charge of her
bones. I only pray that our sons may never see any wars again."
IN VARIOUS ROLES
In the following reminiscences will frequently be mentioned a
lady who played a great part in the annals of the police from
1848 to 1866. We will call her "Wanda von Chabert." Born in
Galicia of German parents, and carefully brought up in every way,
when only sixteen she married, from love, a rich and handsome
officer of noble birth. The young couple, however, lived beyond
their means, and when the husband died suddenly, two years after
they were married, she was left anything but well off.
As Wanda had grown accustomed to luxury and amusement, a quiet
life in her parents' house did not suit her any longer. Even
while she was still in mourning for her husband, she allowed a
Hungarian magnate to make love to her. She went off with him at a
venture, and continued the same extravagant life which she had
led when her husband was alive, of her own volition. At the end
of two years, however, her lover left her in a town in North
Italy, almost without means. She was thinking of going on the
stage, when chance provided her with another resource, which
enabled her to reassert her position in society. She became a
secret police agent, and soon was one of their most valuable
members. In addition to the proverbial charm and wit of a Polish
woman, she also possessed high linguistic attainments, and spoke
Polish, Russian, French, German, English, and Italian, with
almost equal fluency and correctness. Then she had that
encyclopedic polish which impresses people much more than the
most profound learning of the specialist, She was very attractive
in appearance, and she knew how to set off her good looks by all
the arts of dress and coquetry.
In addition to this, she was a woman of the world in the widest
sense of the term; pleasure-loving, faithless, unstable, and
therefore never in any danger of really losing her heart, and
consequently her head. She used to change the place of her abode,
according to what she had to do. Sometimes she lived in Paris
among the Polish emigrants, in order to find out what they were
doing, and maintained intimate relations with the Tuileries and
the Palais Royal at the same time; sometimes she went to London
for a short time, or hurried off to Italy to watch the Hungarian
exiles, only to reappear suddenly in Switzerland, or at one of
the fashionable German watering-places.
In revolutionary circles, she was looked upon as an active member
of the great League of Freedom, and diplomatists regarded her as
an influential friend of Napoleon III.
She knew everyone, but especially those men whose names were to
be met with every day in the journals, and she counted Victor
Emmanuel, Rouher, Gladstone, and Gortschakoff among her friends
as well as Mazzini, Kossuth, Garibaldi, Mieroslawsky, and
Bakunin.
In the spring of 185- she was at Vevey on the lovely lake of
Geneva, and went into raptures when talking to an old German
diplomatist about the beauties of nature, and about Calame,
Stifter, and Turgenev, whose "Diary of a Hunter," had just become
fashionable. One day a man appeared at the table d'hote, who
excited unusual attention, and hers especially, so that there was
nothing strange in her asking the proprietor of the hotel what
his name was. She was told that he was a wealthy Brazilian, and
that his name was Don Escovedo.
Whether it was an accident, or whether he responded to the
interest which the young woman felt for him, at any rate she
constantly met him whereever she went, whether taking a walk, or
on the lake or looking at the newspapers in the reading-room. At
last she was obliged to confess to herself that he was the
handsomest man she had ever seen. Tall slim, and yet muscular,
the young, beardless Brazilian had a head which any woman might
envy, features not only beautiful and noble, but also extremely
delicate, dark eyes which possessed a wonderful charm, and thick,
auburn, curly hair, which completed the attractiveness and the
strangeness of his appearance.
They soon became acquainted, through a Prussian officer whom the
Brazilian had asked for an introduction to the beautiful Polish
lady--for Frau von Chabert was taken for one in Vevey. She, cold
and designing as she was, blushed slightly when he stood before
her for the first time; and when he gave her his arm, he could
feel her hand tremble slightly on it. The same evening they went
out riding together, the next he was lying at her feet, and on
the third she was his. For four weeks the lovely Wanda and the
Brazilian lived together as if they had been in Paradise, but he
could not deceive her searching eyes any longer.
Her sharp and practiced eye had already discovered in him that
indefinable something which makes a man appear a suspicious
character. Any other woman would have been pained and horrified
at such a discovery, but she found the strange consolation in it
that her handsome adorer promised also to become a very
interesting object for pursuit, and so she began systematically
to watch the man who lay unsuspectingly at her feet.
She soon found out that he was no conspirator; but she asked
herself in vain whether she was to look for a common swindler, an
impudent adventurer, or perhaps even a criminal in him. The day
that she had foreseen soon came; the Brazilian's banker
"unaccountably" had omitted to send him any money, and so he
borrowed some of her. "So he is a male courtesan," she said to
herself. The handsome man soon required money again, and she lent
it to him again. Then at last he left suddenly and nobody knew
where he had gone to; only this much, that he had left Vevey as
the companion of an old but wealthy Wallachian lady. So this time
clever Wanda was duped.
A year afterward she met the Brazilian unexpectedly at Lucca,
with an insipid-looking, light-haired, thin Englishwoman on his
arm. Wanda stood still and looked at him steadily, but he glanced
at her quite indifferently; he did not choose to know her again.
The next morning, however, his valet brought her a letter from
him, which contained the amount of his debt in Italian
hundred-lire notes, accompanied by a very cool excuse. Wanda was
satisfied, but she wished to find out who the lady was, in whose
company she constantly saw Don Escovedo.
"Don Escovedo."
An Austrian count, who had a loud and silly laugh, said:
"Who has saddled you with that yarn? The lady is Lady
Nitingsdale, and his name is Romanesco."
"Romanesco?"
"Yes, he is a rich Boyar from Moldavia, where he has extensive
estates."
Romanesco ran a faro bank in his apartments, and certainly
cheated, for he nearly always won; it was not long, therefore,
before other people in good society at Lucca shared Madame von
Chabert's suspicions, and, consequently, Romanesco thought it
advisable to vanish as suddenly from Lucca as Escovedo had done
from Vevey, and without leaving any more traces behind him.
Some time afterward, Madame von Chabert was on the Island of
Heligoland, for the sea-bathing; and one day she saw
Escovedo-Romanesco sitting opposite to her at the table d'hote,
in very animated conversation with a Russian lady; only his hair
had turned black since she had seen him last. Evidently his light
hair had become too compromising for him.
"The sea-water seems to have a very remarkable effect upon your
hair," Wanda said to him spitefully, in a whisper.
"Do you think so?" he replied, condescendingly.
"I fancy that at one time your hair was fair."
"You are mistaking me for somebody else," the Brazilian replied,
quietly.
"I am not."
"For whom do you take me, pray?" he said with an insolent smile.
"For Don Escovedo."
"I am Count Dembizki from Valkynia," the former Brazilian said
with a bow; "perhaps you would like to see my passport."
"Well, perhaps--"
And he had the impudence to show her his false passport.
A year afterward Wanda met Count Dembizki in Baden, near Vienna.
His hair was still black, but he had a magnificent, full, black
beard; he had become a Greek prince, and his name was Anastasio
Maurokordatos. She met him once in one of the side walks in the
park, where he could not avoid her. "If it goes on like this,"
she called out to him in a mocking voice, "the next time I see
you, you will be king, of some negro tribe or other."
That time, however, the Brazilian did not deny his identity; on
the contrary, he surrendered at discretion, and implored her not
to betray him. As she was not revengeful she pardoned him, after
enjoying his terror for a time, and promised him that she would
hold her tongue, as long as he did nothing contrary to the laws.
"First of all, I must beg you not to gamble."
"You have only to command; and we do not know each other in the
future"
"I must certainly insist on that," she said maliciously.
The "Exotic Prince" had, however, made a conquest of the charming
daughter of a wealthy Austrian count, and had cut out an
excellent young officer, who was wooing her. The latter, in his
despair, began to make love to Frau von Chabert, and at last told
her he loved her. But she only laughed at him.
"You are very cruel," he stammered in confusion.
"I? What are you thinking about?" Wanda replied, still smiling;
"all I mean is that you have directed your love to the wrong
address, for Countess--"
"Do not speak of her; she is engaged to another man."
"As long as I choose to permit it," she said; "but what will you
do if I bring her back to your arms? Will you still call me
cruel?"
"Can you do this?" the young officer asked, in great excitement.
"Well, supposing I can do it, what shall I be then?"
"An angel, whom I shall thank on my knees."
A few days later, the rivals met at a coffee-house; the Greek
prince began to lie and boast, and the Austrian officer gave him
the lie direct. In consequence, it was arranged that they should
fight a duel with pistols next morning in a wood close to Baden.
But as the officer was leaving the house with his seconds the
next morning, a Police Commissary came up to him and begged him
not to trouble himself any further about the matter, but another
time to be more careful before accepting a challenge.
"What does it mean?" the officer asked, in some surprise.
"It means that this Maurokordatos is a dangerous swindler and
adventurer, whom we have just taken into custody."
"He is not a prince?"
"No; a circus rider."
An hour later, the officer received a letter from the charming
Countess, in which she humbly begged for pardon. The happy lover
set off to go and see her immediately, but on the way a sudden
thought struck him, and so he turned back in order to thank
beautiful Wanda, as he had promised, on his knees.
THE FALSE GEMS
M. Lantin had met the young woman at a soiree, at the home of the
assistant chief of his bureau, and at first sight had fallen
madly in love with her.
She was the daughter of a country physician who had died some
months previously. She had come to live in Paris, with her
mother, who visited much among her acquaintances, in the hope of
making a favorable marriage for her daughter. They were poor and
honest, quiet and unaffected.
The young girl was a perfect type of the virtuous woman whom
every sensible young man dreams of one day winning for life. Her
simple beauty had the charm of angelic modesty, and the
imperceptible smile which constantly hovered about her lips
seemed to be the reflection of a pure and lovely soul. Her
praises resounded on every side. People were never tired of
saying: "Happy the man who wins her love! He could not find a
better wife."
Now M. Lantin enjoyed a snug little income of $700, and, thinking
he could safely assume the responsibilities of matrimony,
proposed to this model young girl and was accepted.
He was unspeakably happy with her; she governed his household so
cleverly and economically that they seemed to live in luxury. She
lavished the most delicate attentions on her husband, coaxed and
fondled him, and the charm of her presence was so great that six
years after their marriage M. Lantin discovered that he loved his
wife even more than during the first days of their honeymoon.
He only felt inclined to blame her for two things: her love of
the theater, and a taste for false jewelry. Her friends (she was
acquainted with some officers' wives) frequently procured for her
a box at the theater, often for the first representations of the
new plays; and her husband was obliged to accompany her, whether
he willed or not, to these amusements, though they bored him
excessively after a day's labor at the office.
After a time, M. Lantin begged his wife to get some lady of her
acquaintance to accompany her. She was at first opposed to such
an arrangement; but, after much persuasion on his part, she
finally consented--to the infinite delight of her husband.
Now, with her love for the theater came also the desire to adorn
her person. True, her costumes remained as before, simple, and in
the most correct taste; but she soon began to ornament her ears
with huge rhinestones which glittered and sparkled like real
diamonds. Around her neck she wore strings of false pearls, and
on her arms bracelets of imitation gold.
Her husband frequently remonstrated with her, saying:
"My dear, as you cannot afford to buy real diamonds, you ought to
appear adorned with your beauty and modesty alone, which are the
rarest ornaments of your sex."
But she would smile sweetly, and say:
"What can I do? I am so fond of jewelry. It is my only weakness.
We cannot change our natures."
Then she would roll the pearl necklaces around her fingers, and
hold up the bright gems for her husband's admiration, gently
coaxing him:
"Look! are they not lovely? One would swear they were real."
M. Lantin would then answer, smilingly:
"You have Bohemian tastes, my dear."
Often of an evening, when they were enjoying a tete-a-tete by the
fireside, she would place on the tea table the leather box
containing the "trash," as M. Lantin called it. She would examine
the false gems with a passionate attention as though they were in
some way connected with a deep and secret joy; and she often
insisted on passing a necklace around her husband's neck, and
laughing heartily would exclaim: "How droll you look!" Then she
would throw herself into his arms and kiss him affectionately.
One evening in winter she attended the opera, and on her return
was chilled through and through. The next morning she coughed,
and eight days later she died of inflammation of the lungs.
M. Lantin's despair was so great that his hair became white in
one month. He wept unceasingly; his heart was torn with grief,
and his mind was haunted by the remembrance, the smile, the
voice--by every charm of his beautiful, dead wife.
Time, the healer, did not assuage his grief. Often during office
hours, while his colleagues were discussing the topics of the
day, his eyes would suddenly fill with tears, and he would give
vent to his grief in heartrending sobs. Everything in his wife's
room remained as before her decease; and here he was wont to
seclude himself daily and think of her who had been his
treasure--the joy of his existence.
But life soon became a struggle. His income, which in the hands
of his wife had covered all household expenses, was now no longer
sufficient for his own immediate wants; and he wondered how she
could have managed to buy such excellent wines, and such rare
delicacies, things which he could no longer procure with his
modest resources.
He incurred some debts and was soon reduced to absolute poverty.
One morning, finding himself without a cent in his pocket, he
resolved to sell something, and, immediately, the thought
occurred to him of disposing of his wife's paste jewels. He
cherished in his heart a sort of rancor against the false gems.
They had always irritated him in the past, and the very sight of
them spoiled somewhat the memory of his lost darling.
To the last days of her life, she had continued to make
purchases; bringing home new gems almost every evening. He
decided to sell the heavy necklace which she seemed to prefer,
and which, he thought, ought to be worth about six or seven
francs; for although paste it was, nevertheless, of very fine
workmanship.
He put it in his pocket and started out in search of a jeweler's
shop. He entered the first one he saw--feeling a little ashamed
to expose his misery, and also to offer such a worthless article
for sale.
"Sir," said he to the merchant, "I would like to know what this
is worth."
The man took the necklace, examined it, called his clerk and made
some remarks in an undertone; then he put the ornament back on
the counter, and looked at it from a distance to judge of the
effect.
M. Lantin was annoyed by all this detail and was on the point of
saying: "Oh! I know well enough it is not worth anything," when
the jeweler said: "Sir, that necklace is worth from twelve to
fifteen thousand francs; but I could not buy it unless you tell
me now whence it comes."
The widower opened his eyes wide and remained gaping, not
comprehending the merchant's meaning. Finally he stammered:. "You
say--are you sure?" The other replied dryly: "You can search
elsewhere and see if anyone will offer you more. I consider it
worth fifteen thousand at the most. Come back here if you cannot
do better."
M. Lantin, beside himself with astonishment, took up the necklace
and left the store. He wished time for reflection.
Once outside, he felt inclined to laugh, and said to himself:
"The fool! Had I only taken him at his word! That jeweler cannot
distinguish real diamonds from paste."
A few minutes after, he entered another store in the Rue de la
Paix. As soon as the proprietor glanced at the necklace, he cried
out:
"Ah, parbleu! I know it well; it was bought here."
M. Lantin was disturbed, and asked:
"How much is it worth?"
"Well, I sold it for twenty thousand francs. I am willing to take
it back for eighteen thousand when you inform me, according to
our legal formality, how it comes to be in your possession."
This time M. Lantin was dumfounded. He replied:
"But--but--examine it well. Until this moment I was under the
impression that it was paste."
Said the jeweler:
"What is your name, sir?"
"Lantin--I am in the employ of the Minister of the Interior. I
live at No. 16 Rue des Martyrs."
The merchant looked through his books, found the entry, and said:
"That necklace was sent to Mme. Lantin's address, 16 Rue des
Martyrs, July 20, 1876."
The two men looked into each other's eyes--the widower speechless
with astonishment, the jeweler scenting a thief. The latter broke
the silence by saying:
"Will you leave this necklace here for twenty-four hours? I will
give you a receipt."
"Certainly," answered M. Lantin, hastily. Then, putting the
ticket in his pocket, he left the store.
He wandered aimlessly through the streets, his mind in a state of
dreadful confusion. He tried to reason, to understand. His wife
could not afford to purchase such a costly ornament. Certainly
not. But, then, it must have been a present!--a present!--a
present from whom? Why was it given her?
He stopped and remained standing in the middle of the street. A
horrible doubt entered his mind--she? Then all the other gems
must have been presents, too! The earth seemed to tremble beneath
him,--the tree before him was falling--throwing up his arms, he
fell to the ground, unconscious. He recovered his senses in a
pharmacy into which the passers-by had taken him, and was then
taken to his home. When he arrived he shut himself up in his room
and wept until nightfall. Finally, overcome with fatigue, he
threw himself on the bed, where he passed an uneasy, restless
night.
The following morning he arose and prepared to go to the office.
It was hard to work after such a, shock. He sent a letter to his
employer requesting to be excused. Then he remembered that he had
to return to the jeweler's. He did not like the idea; but he
could not leave the necklace with that man. So he dressed and
went out.
It was a lovely day; a clear blue sky smiled on the busy city
below, and men of leisure were strolling about with their hands
in their pockets.
Observing them, M. Lantin said to himself: "The rich, indeed, are
happy. With money it is possible to forget even the deepest
sorrow. One can go where one pleases, and in travel find that
distraction which is the surest cure for grief. Oh! if I were
only rich!"
He began to feel hungry, but his pocket was empty. He again
remembered the necklace. Eighteen thousand francs! Eighteen
thousand francs! What a sum!
He soon arrived in the Rue de la Paix, opposite the jeweler's.
Eighteen thousand francs! Twenty times he resolved to go in, but
shame kept him back. He was hungry, however,--very hungry, and
had not a cent in his pocket. He decided quickly, ran across the
street in order not to have time for reflection, and entered the
store.
The proprietor immediately came forward, and politely offered him
a chair; the clerks glanced at him knowingly.
"I have made inquiries, M. Lantin," said the jeweler, "and if you
are still resolved to dispose of the gems, I am ready to pay you
the price I offered."
"Certainly, sir," stammered M. Lantin.
Whereupon the proprietor took from a drawer eighteen large bills,
counted and handed them to M. Lantin, who signed a receipt and
with a trembling hand put the money into his pocket.
As he was about to leave the store, he turned toward the
merchant, who still wore the same knowing smile, and lowering his
eyes, said:
"I have--I have other gems which I have received from the same
source. Will you buy them also?"
The merchant bowed: "Certainly, sir."
M. Lantin said gravely: "I will bring them to you." An hour later
he returned with the gems.
The large diamond earrings were worth twenty thousand francs; the
bracelets thirty-five thousand; the rings, sixteen thousand; a
set of emeralds and sapphires, fourteen thousand; a gold chain
with solitaire pendant, forty thousand--making the sum of one
hundred and forty-three thousand francs.
The jeweler remarked, jokingly:
"There was a person who invested all her earnings in precious
stones."
M. Lantin replied, seriously:
"It is only another way of investing one's money."
That day he lunched at Voisin's and drank wine worth twenty
francs a bottle. Then he hired a carriage and made a tour of the
Bois, and as he scanned the various turn-outs with a contemptuous
air he could hardly refrain from crying out to the occupants:
"I, too, am rich!--I am worth two hundred thousand francs."
Suddenly he thought of his employer. He drove up to the office,
and entered gaily, saying:
"Sir, I have come to resign my position. I have just inherited
three hundred thousand francs."
He shook hands with his former colleagues and confided to them
some of his projects for the future; then he went off to dine at
the Cafe Anglais.
He seated himself beside a gentleman of aristocratic bearing, and
during the meal informed the latter confidentially that he had
just inherited a fortune of four hundred thousand francs.
For the first time in his life he was not bored at the theater,
and spent the remainder of the night in a gay frolic.
Six months afterward he married again. His second wife was a very
virtuous woman, with a violent temper. She caused him much
sorrow.
COUNTESS SATAN
I.
They were discussing dynamite, the social revolution, Nihilism,
and even those who cared least about politics had something to
say. Some were alarmed, others philosophized, and others again
tried to smile.
"Bah!" N----said, "when we are all blown up, we shall see what it
is like. Perhaps, after all, it may be an amusing sensation,
provided one goes high enough."
"But we shall not be blown up at all," G----, the optimist, said,
interrupting him. "It is all a romance."
"You are mistaken, my dear fellow," Jules de C----replied. "It is
like a romance, but with this confounded Nihilism, everything is
the same; it would be a mistake to trust to it. For instance, the
manner in which I made Bakounine's acquaintance--"
They knew that he was a good narrator, and it was no secret that
his life had been an adventurous one, so they drew closer to him,
and listened intently. This is what he told them:
II
"I met Countess Nioska W----, that strange woman who was usually
called Countess Satan, in Naples. I immediately attached myself
to her out of curiosity, and soon fell in love with her. Not that
she was beautiful, for she was a Russian with the bad
characteristics of the Russian type. She was thin and squat at
the same time, while her face was sallow and puffy, with high
cheek-bones and a Cossack's nose. But her conversation bewitched
everyone.
"She was many-sided, learned, a philosopher, scientifically
depraved, satanic. Perhaps the word is rather pretentious, but it
exactly expresses what I want to say, for in other words she
loved evil for the sake of evil. She rejoiced in other people's
vices; she liked to sow the seeds of evil, in order to see it
flourish. And that, too, by fraud on an enormous scale. It was
not enough for her to corrupt individuals, she only did that to
keep her hand in; what she wished to do was to corrupt the
masses. By slightly altering it after her own fashion, she might
have used Caligula's famous wish. She also might have wished that
the whole human race had but one head; not in order that she
might cut it off, but that she might make the philosophy of
Nihilism flourish there.
"What a temptation to become the lord and master of such a
monster! I allowed myself to be tempted, and undertook the
adventure. The means came unsought for by me, and the only thing
that I had to do was to show myself more perverted and satanic
than she was herself. And so I played the devil.
" 'Yes,' I said, 'we writers are the best workmen for doing evil,
as our books may be bottles of poison. The so-called men of
action only turn the handle of the mitrailleuse which we have
loaded. Formulas will destroy the world, and it is we who invent
them.'
" 'That is true,' said she, 'and that is what is wanting in
Bakounine, I am sorry to say.'
"That name was constantly in her mouth. So I asked her for
details, which she gave me, as she knew the man intimately.
" 'After all,' she said, with a contemptuous grimace, 'he is only
a kind of Garibaldi.'
"She told me, although she made fun of him as she did so, about
that 'Odyssey' of the barricades and of the hulks which made up
Bakounine's history, and which is, nevertheless, the exact truth;
about his adventures as chief of the insurgents at Prague and
then at Dresden; of his first death sentence; about his
imprisonment at Olmutz, in the casemates of the fortress of St.
Peter and St. Paul, and in a subterranean dungeon at
Schusselburg; about his exile to Siberia and his wonderful escape
down the river Amour, on a Japanese coasting-vessel, and about
his final arrival, by way of Yokohama and San Francisco, in London,
whence he was directing all the operations of Nihilism.
" 'You see,' she said, 'he is a thorough adventurer, and now all
his adventures are over. He got married at Tobolsk and became a
mere respectable, middle-class man. And then he has no individual
ideas. Herzen, the pamphleteer of "Kolokol," inspired him with
the only fertile phrase that he ever uttered: "Land and Liberty!"
But that is not yet the definite formula, the general
formula--what I may call the dynamite formula. At best, Bakounine
would only become an incendiary, and burn down cities. And what
is that, I ask you? Bah! A second-hand Rostoptchin! He wants a
prompter, and I offered to become his, but he did not take me
seriously.'
 * * * * * * *
"It would be useless to enter into all the psychological details
which marked the course of my passion for the Countess, and to
explain to you more fully the curious and daily growing
attraction which she had for me. It was getting exasperating, and
the more so as she resisted me as stoutly as the shyest of
innocents could have done. At the end of a month of mad Satanism,
I saw what her game was. Do you know what she intended? She meant
to make me Bakounine's prompter, or, at any rate, that is what
she said. But no doubt she reserved the right to herself--at
least that is how I understood her--to prompt the prompter, and
my passion for her, which she purposely left unsatisfied, assured
her that absolute power over me.
"All this may appear madness to you, but it is, nevertheless, the
exact truth. In short, one morning she bluntly made the offer:
" 'Become Bakounine's soul, and you shall possess me.'
"Of course I accepted, for it was too fantastically strange to
refuse. Don't you think so? What an adventure! What luck! A
number of letters between the Countess and Bakounine prepared the
way; I was introduced to him at his house, and they discussed me
there. I became a sort of Western prophet, a mystic charmer who
was ready to nihilize the Latin races, the Saint Paul of the new
religion of nothingness, and at last a day was fixed for us to
meet in London. He lived in a small, one-storied house in
Pimlico, with a tiny garden in front, and nothing noticeable
about it.
"We were first of all shown into the commonplace parlor of all
English homes, and then upstairs. The room where the Countess and
I were left was small, and very badly furnished. It had a square
table with writing materials on it, in the center of the room.
This was his sanctuary. The deity soon appeared, and I saw him in
flesh and bone--especially in flesh, for he was enormously stout.
His broad face, with prominent cheek-bones, in spite of fat; a
nose like a double funnel; and small, sharp eyes, which had a
magnetic lock, proclaimed the Tartar, the old Turanian blood
which produced the Attilas, the Genghis-Khans, the Tamerlanes.
The obesity which is characteristic of nomad races, who are
always on horseback or driving, added to his Asiatic look. The
man was certainly not a European, a slave, a descendant of the
deistic Aryans, but a scion of the atheistic hordes who had
several times already almost overrun Europe, and who, instead of
ideas of progress, have Nihilism buried in their hearts.
"I was astonished, for I had not expected that the majesty of a
whole race could be thus revived in a man, and my stupefaction
increased after an hour's conversation. I could quite understand
why such a Colossus had not wished for the Countess as his
Egeria; she was a silly child to have dreamed of acting such a
part to such a thinker. She had not felt the profoundness of that
horrible, philosophy which was hidden under his material
activity, nor had she seen the prophet under this hero of the
barricades. Perhaps he had not thought it advisable to reveal
himself to her; but he revealed himself to me, and inspired me
with terror.
"A prophet? Oh! yes. He thought himself an Attila, and foresaw
the consequences of his revolution; it was not only from instinct
but also from theory that he urged a nation on to Nihilism. The
phrase is not his, but Turgenieff's, I believe, but the idea
certainly belonged to him. He got his programme of agricultural
communism from Herzen, and his destructive radicalism from
Pougatcheff, but he did not stop there. I mean that he went on to
evil for the sake of evil. Herzen wished for the happiness of the
Slav peasant; Pougatcheff wanted to be elected Emperor, but all
that Bakounine wanted was to overthrow the actual order of
things, no matter by what means, and to replace social
concentration by a universal upheaval.
"It was the dream of a Tartar; it was true Nihilism pushed to
extreme and practical conclusions. It was, in a word, the applied
philosophy of chance, the indeterminate end of anarchy. Monstrous
it may be, but grand in its monstrosity!
"And you must note that the typical man of action so despised by
the Countess was, in Bakounine, the gigantic dreamer whom I have
just shown to you. His dream did not remain a dream, but began to
be realized. It was by the care of Bakounine that the Nihilistic
party became an entity; a party in which there is a little of
everything, you know, but on the whole, a formidable party, the
advanced guard of which is true Nihilism, whose object is nothing
less than to destroy the Western world, to see it blossom from
under the ruins of a general dispersion, the last conception of
modern Tartarism.
"I never saw Bakounine again, for the Countess's conquest would
have been too dearly bought by any attempt to act a comedy with
this 'Old-Man-of-the-Mountain.' And besides that, after this
visit, poor Countess Satan appeared to me quite silly. Her famous
Satanism was nothing but the flicker of a spirit-lamp, after the
general conflagration of which the other had dreamed. She had
certainly shown herself very silly, when she could not understand
that prodigious monster. And as she had seduced me only by her
intellect and her perversity, I was disgusted as soon as she laid
aside that mask. I left her without telling her of my intention,
and never saw her again, either.
"No doubt they both took me for a spy from the 'Third Section of
the Imperial Chancellery.' In that case, they must have thought
me very clever to have escaped discovery, and all I have to do is
to look out, lest any affiliated members of their society
recognize me!"
Then he smiled and, turning to the waiter who had just come in,
said: "Open another bottle of champagne, and make the cork pop!
It will, at any rate, remind us of the day when we ourselves
shall be blown up with dynamite."
THE COLONEL'S IDEAS
"upon my word," said Colonel Laporte, "I am old and gouty, my
legs are as stiff as two sticks, and yet if a pretty woman were
to tell me to go through the eye of a needle, I believe I should
take a jump at it, like a clown through a hoop. I shall die like
that; it is in the blood. I am an old beau, one of the old
regime, and the sight of a woman, a pretty woman, stirs me to the
tips of my toes. There!
"And then we are all very much alike in France; we remain
cavaliers, cavaliers of love and fortune, since God has been
abolished, whose bodyguard we really were. But nobody will ever
get the woman out of our hearts; there she is, and there she will
remain; we love her, and shall continue to love her, and to
commit all kinds of frolics on her account, so long as there is a
France on the map of Europe. And even if France were to be wiped
off the map, there would always be Frenchmen left.
"When I am in the presence of a woman, of a pretty woman, I feel
capable of anything. By Jove, when I feel her looks penetrating
me, those confounded looks which set your blood on fire, I could
do anything: fight a duel, have a row, smash the furniture,
anything just to show that I am the strongest, the bravest, the
most daring, and the most devoted of men.
"But I am not the only one--certainly not; the whole French army
is like me, that I will swear to. From the common soldier to the
general, we all go forward, and to the very end, mark you, when
there is a woman in the case, a pretty woman. Remember what Joan
of Arc made us do formerly! Come, I'd make a bet that if a pretty
woman had taken command of the army on the eve of Sedan, when
Marshal MacMahon was wounded, we should have broken through the
Prussian lines, by Jove! and have had a drink out of their guns.
"It was not Trochu, but Saint Genevieve, who was required in
Paris, and I remember a little anecdote of the war which proves
that we are capable of everything in the presence of a woman.
"I was a captain, a simple captain, at the time, and was in
command of a detachment of scouts who were retreating through a
district swarming with Prussians. We were surrounded, pursued,
tired out, and half dead with fatigue and hunger, and by the next
day we had to reach Bar-sur-Tain; otherwise we should be done
for, cut off from the main body and killed. I do not know how we
managed to escape so far. However, we had ten leagues to go
during the night, ten leagues through the snow, and upon empty
stomachs. I thought to myself:
" 'It is all over; my poor fellows will never be able to do it.'
"We had eaten nothing since the day before, and the whole day
long we remained hidden in a barn, huddled close together, so as
not to feel the cold so much; we did not venture to speak or even
move, and we slept by fits and starts, like you sleep when you
are worn out with fatigue.
"It was dark by five o'clock, that wan darkness caused by the
snow, and I shook up my men. Some of them would not get up; they
were almost incapable of moving or of standing upright, and their
joints were stiff from the cold and want of motion.
"In front of us there was a large expanse of flat, bare country;
the snow was still falling like a curtain, in large, white
flakes, which concealed everything under a heavy, thick, frozen
mantle, a mattress of ice. You would have thought that it was the
end of things.
" 'Come, my lads, let us start.'
"They looked at the thick, white dust which was coming down, and
seemed to think: 'We have had enough of this; we may just as well
die here!' Then I took out my revolver, and said:
" 'I will shoot the first man who flinches.' And so they set off,
but very slowly, like men whose legs were of very little use to
them. I sent four of them three hundred yards ahead, to scout,
and the others followed pellmell, walking at random and without
any order. I put the strongest in the rear, with orders to
quicken the pace of the sluggards with the points of their
bayonets in the back.
"The snow seemed as if it were going to bury us alive; it
powdered our kepis[1] and cloaks without melting, and made
phantoms of us, ghosts of worn-out soldiers who were very tired,
and I said to myself: 'We shall never get out of this, except by
a miracle.'
[1] Forage-caps.
"Sometimes we had to stop for a few minutes, on account of those
who could not follow us, hearing nothing but the falling snow,
that vague, almost indiscernible sound which the flakes make, as
they come down together. Some of the men shook themselves, but
others did not move, and so I gave the order to set off again;
they shouldered their rifles, and with weary feet we set out
again, when suddenly the scouts fell back. Something had alarmed
them;  they had heard voices in front of them, and so I sent six
men and a sergeant on ahead, and waited.
"All at once a shrill cry, a woman's cry, pierced through the
heavy silence of the snow, and in a few minutes they brought back
two prisoners, an old man and a girl, whom I questioned in a low
voice. They were escaping from the Prussians, who had occupied
their house during the evening, and who had got drunk. The father
had become alarmed on his daughter's account, and, without even
telling their servants, they had made their escape into the
darkness. I saw immediately that they belonged to the upper
classes, and, as I should have done in any case, I invited them
to come with us. So we started off together, and as the old man
knew the road, he acted as our guide.
"It had ceased snowing; the stars appeared, and the cold became
intense. The girl, who was leaning on her father's arm, walked
wearily and with jerks, and several times she murmured:
" 'I have no feeling at all in my feet.' I suffered more than she
did, I believe, to see that poor little woman dragging herself
like that through the snow. But suddenly she stopped, and said:
" 'Father, I am so tired that I cannot go any further.'
"The old man wanted to carry her, but he could not even lift her
up, and she fell on the ground with a deep sigh. We all came
round her, and as for me, I stamped on the ground, not knowing
what to do, quite unable to make up my mind to abandon that man
and girl like that. Suddenly one of the soldiers, a Parisian,
whom they had nicknamed 'Pratique,' said:
" 'Come, comrades, we must carry the young lady, otherwise we
shall not show ourselves Frenchmen, confound it!'
"I really believe that I swore with pleasure, and said: 'That is
very good of you, my children; I will take my share of the
burden.'
"We could indistinctly see the trees of a little wood on the
left, through the darkness. Several men went into it, and soon
came back with a bundle of branches twisted into a litter.
" 'Who will lend his cloak? It is for a pretty girl, comrades,'
Pratique said, and ten cloaks were thrown to him. In a moment,
the girl was lying, warm and comfortable, among them, and was
raised upon six shoulders. I placed myself at their head, on the
right, and very pleased I was with my charge.
"We started off much more briskly, as if we had been having a
drink of wine, and I even heard a few jokes. A woman is quite
enough to electrify Frenchmen, you see. The soldiers, who were
reanimated and warm, had almost reformed their ranks, and an old
franc-tireur[2] who was following the litter, waiting for his
turn to replace the first of his comrades who might give in, said
to one of his neighbors, loud enough for me to hear:
[2] Volunteers, in the Franco-German war of 1870-71, of whom the
Germans often made short work when caught.
" 'I am not a young man, now; but by Jove, there is nothing like
a woman to make you feel queer from head to foot!'
"We went on, almost without stopping, until three o'clock in the
morning, when suddenly our scouts fell back again. Soon the whole
detachment showed nothing but a vague shadow on the ground, as
the men lay on the snow, and I gave my orders in a low voice, and
heard the harsh, metallic sound of the cocking of rifles. There,
in the middle of the plain, some strange object was moving about.
It might have been taken for some enormous animal running about,
which uncoiled itself like a serpent, or came together into a
coil, then suddenly went quickly to the right or left, stopped,
and then went on again. But presently the wandering shape came
near, and I saw a dozen lancers, one behind the other, who were
trying to find their way, which they had lost.
"By this time they were so near that I could hear the panting of
the horses, the clink of the swords, and the creaking of the
saddles, and so cried: 'Fire!'
"Fifty rifle-shots broke the stillness of the night; then there
were four or five reports, and at last one single shot was heard.
When the smoke had cleared away we saw that the twelve men and
nine horses had fallen. Three of the animals were galloping away
at a furious pace. One of them was dragging the body of its rider
behind it. His foot had caught in the stirrup, and his body
rebounded from the ground in a horrible way.
"One of the soldiers behind me gave a harsh laugh, and said:
'There are a few more widows now!'
"Perhaps he was married. And another added: 'It did not take
long!'
"A head was put out of the litter:
" 'What is the matter?' she asked; 'you are fighting?'
" 'It is nothing, Mademoiselle,' I replied; 'we have got rid of a
dozen Prussians!'
" 'Poor fellows!' she said. But as she was cold, she quickly
disappeared beneath the cloaks again, and we started off once
more. We marched on for a long time, and at last the sky began to
grow pale. The snow became quite clear, luminous, and bright, and
a rosy tint appeared in the east. Suddenly a voice in the
distance cried:
" 'Who goes there?'
"The whole detachment halted, and I advanced to say who we were.
We had reached the French lines, and as my men defiled before the
outpost, a commandant on horseback, whom I had informed of what
had taken place, asked in a sonorous voice, as he saw the litter
pass him:
" 'What have you there?'
"And immediately a small head, covered with light hair, appeared,
disheveled and smiling, and replied:
" 'It is I, Monsieur.'
"At this, the men raised a hearty laugh, and we felt quite
light-hearted, while Pratique, who was walking by the side of the
litter, waved his kepi, and shouted:
"Vive la France!' And I felt really moved. I do not know why,
except that I thought it a pretty and gallant thing to say.
"It seemed to me as if we had just saved the whole of France, and
had done something that other men could not have done, something
simple, and really patriotic. I shall never forget that little
face, you may be sure, and if I had to give my opinion about
abolishing drums, trumpets, and bugles, I should propose to
replace them in every regiment by a pretty girl, and that would
be even better than playing the 'Marseillaise.' By Jove! it would
put some spirit into a trooper to have a Madonna like that, a
living Madonna, by the colonel's side."
He was silent for a few moments, and then with an air of
conviction, and jerking his head, continued:
"You see, we are very fond of women, we Frenchmen!"
TWO LITTLE SOLDIERS
Every Sunday, the moment they were dismissed, the two little
soldiers made off. Once outside the barracks, they struck out to
the right through Courbevoie, walking with long rapid strides, as
though they were on a march.
When they were beyond the last of the houses, they slackened pace
along the bare, dusty roadway which goes toward Bezons.
They were both small and thin, and looked quite lost in their
coats, which were too big and too long. Their sleeves hung down
over their hands, and they found their enormous red breeches,
which compelled them to waddle, very much in the way. Under their
stiff, high helmets their faces had little character--two poor,
sallow Breton faces, simple with an almost animal simplicity, and
with gentle and quiet blue eyes.
They never conversed during these walks, but went straight on,
each with the same thought in his head. This thought atoned for
the lack of conversation; it was this, that just inside the
little wood near Les Champioux they had found a place which
reminded them of their own country, where they could feel happy
again.
When they arrived under the trees where the roads from Colombes
and from Chatou cross, they would take off their heavy helmets
and wipe their foreheads. They always halted on the Bezons bridge
to look at the Seine, and would remain there two or three
minutes, bent double, leaning on the parapet.
Sometimes they would gaze out over the great basin of Argenteuil,
where the skiffs might be seen scudding, with their white,
careening sails, recalling perhaps the look of the Breton waters,
the harbor of Vanne, near which they lived, and the fishing-boats
standing out across the Morbihan to the open sea.
Just beyond the Seine they bought their provisions from a sausage
merchant, a baker, and a wine-seller. A piece of blood-pudding,
four sous' worth of bread, and a liter of "petit bleu"
constituted the provisions, which they carried off in their
handkerchiefs. After they had left Bezons they traveled slowly
and began to talk.
In front of them a barren plain studded with clumps of trees led
to the wood, to the little wood which had seemed to them to
resemble the one at Kermarivan. Grainfields and hayfields
bordered the narrow path, which lost itself in the young
greenness of the crops, and Jean Kerderen would always say to Luc
le Ganidec:
"It looks like it does near Plounivon."
"Yes; exactly."
Side by side they strolled, their souls filled with vague
memories of their own country, with awakened images as naive as
the pictures on the colored broadsheets which you buy for a
penny. They kept on recognizing, as it were, now a corner of a
field, a hedge, a bit of moorland, now a crossroad, now a granite
cross. Then, too, they would always stop beside a certain
landmark, a great stone, because it looked something like the
cromlech at Locneuven.
Every Sunday on arriving at the first clump of trees Luc le
Ganidec would cut a switch, a hazel switch, and begin gently to
peel off the bark, thinking meanwhile of the folk at home. Jean
Kerderen carried the provisions.
From time to time Luc would mention a name, or recall some deed
of their childhood in a few brief words, which caused long
thoughts. And their own country, their dear, distant country,
recaptured them little by little, seizing on their imaginations,
and sending to them from afar her shapes, her sounds, her
well-known prospects, her odors--odors of the green lands where
the salt sea-air was blowing.
No longer conscious of the exhalations of the Parisian stables,
on which the earth of the banlieue fattens, they scented the
perfume of the flowering broom, which the salt breeze of the open
sea plucks and bears away. And the sails of the boats from the
river banks seemed like the white wings of the coasting vessels
seen beyond the great plain which extended from their homes to
the very margin of the sea.
They walked with short steps, Luc le Ganidec and Jean Kerderen,
content and sad, haunted by a sweet melancholy, by the lingering,
ever-present sorrow of a caged animal who remembers his liberty.
By the time that Luc had stripped the slender wand of its bark
they reached the corner of the wood where every Sunday they took
breakfast. They found the two bricks which they kept hidden in
the thicket, and kindled a little fire of twigs, over which to
roast the blood-pudding at the end of a bayonet.
When they had breakfasted, eaten their bread to the last crumb,
and drunk their wine to the last drop, they remained seated side
by side upon the grass, saying nothing, their eyes on the
distance, their eyelids drooping, their fingers crossed as at
mass, their red legs stretched out beside the poppies of the
field. And the leather of their helmets and the brass of their
buttons glittered in the ardent sun, making the larks, which sang
and hovered above their heads, cease in mid-song.
Toward noon they began to turn their eyes from time to time in
the direction of the village of Bezons, because the girl with the
cow was coming. She passed by them every Sunday on her way to
milk and change the pasture of her cow--the only cow in this
district which ever went out of the stable to grass. It was
pastured in a narrow field along the edge of the wood a little
farther on.
They soon perceived the girl, the only human being within vision,
and were gladdened by the brilliant reflections thrown off by the
tin milk-pail under the rays of the sun. They never talked about
her. They were simply glad to see her, without understanding why.
She was a big strong wench with red hair, burned by the heat of
sunny days, a sturdy product of the environs of Paris.
Once, finding them seated in the same place, she said:
"Good morning. You two are always here, aren't you?"
Luc le Ganidec, the bolder, stammered:
"Yes, we come to rest."
That was all. But the next Sunday she laughed on seeing them,
laughed with a protecting benevolence and a feminine keenness
which knew well enough that they were bashful. And she asked:
"What are you doing there? Are you trying to see the grass grow?"
Luc was cheered up by this, and smiled likewise: "Maybe we are."
"That's pretty slow work," said she.
He answered, still laughing: "Well, yes, it is."
She went on. But coming back with a milk-pail full of milk, she
stopped again before them, and said:
"Would you like a little? It will taste like home."
With the instinctive feeling that they were of the same peasant
race as she, being herself perhaps also far away from home, she
had divined and touched the spot.
They were both touched. Then with some difficulty, she managed to
make a little milk run into the neck of the glass bottle in which
they carried their wine. And Luc drank first, with little
swallows, stopping every minute to see whether he had drunk more
than his half. Then he handed the bottle to Jean.
She stood upright before them, her hands on her hips, her pail on
the ground at her feet, glad at the pleasure which she had given.
Then she departed, shouting: "Allons, adieu! Till next Sunday!"
And as long as they could see her at all, they followed with
their eyes her tall silhouette, which faded, growing smaller and
smaller, seeming to sink into the verdure of the fields.
When they were leaving the barracks the week after, Jean said to
Luc:
"Oughtn't we to buy her something good?"
They were in great embarrassment before the problem of the choice
of a delicacy for the girl with the cow. Luc was of the opinion
that a little tripe would be the best, but Jean preferred some
berlingots because he was fond of sweets. His choice fairly made
him enthusiastic, and they bought at a grocer's two sous' worth
of white and red candies.
They ate their breakfast more rapidly than usual, being nervous
with expectation.
Jean saw her first. "There she is!" he cried. Luc added: "Yes,
there she is."
While yet some distance off she laughed at seeing them. Then she
cried:
"Is everything going as you like it?"
And in unison they asked:
"Are you getting on all right?"
Then she conversed, talked to them of simple things in which they
felt an interest--of the weather, of the crops, and of her
master.
They were afraid to offer her the candies, which were slowly
melting away in Jean's pocket.
At last Luc grew bold, and murmured:
"We have brought you something."
She demanded, "What is it? Tell me!"
Then Jean, blushing up to his ears, managed to get at the little
paper cornucopia, and held it out.
She began to eat the little bonbons, rolling them from one cheek
to the other where they made little round lumps. The two
soldiers, seated before her, gazed at her with emotion and
delight.
Then she went to milk her cow, and once more gave them some milk
on coming back.
They thought of her all the week; several times they even spoke
of her. The next Sunday she sat down with them for a little
longer talk; and all three, seated side by side, their eyes lost
in the distance, clasping their knees with their hands, told the
small doings, the minute details of life in the villages where
they had been born, while over there the cow, seeing that the
milkmaid had stopped on her way, stretched out toward her its
heavy head with its dripping nostrils, and gave a long low to
call her.
Soon the girl consented to eat a bit of bread with them and drink
a mouthful of wine. She often brought them plums in her pocket,
for the season of plums had come. Her presence sharpened the wits
of the two little Breton soldiers, and they chattered like two
birds.
But, one Tuesday, Luc le Ganidec asked for leave--a thing which
had never happened before--and he did not return until ten
o'clock at night. Jean racked his brains uneasily for a reason
for his comrade's going out in this way.
The next Thursday Luc, having borrowed ten sous from his
bedfellow, again asked and obtained permission to leave the
barracks for several hours. When he set off with Jean on their
Sunday walk his manner was very queer, quite restless, and quite
changed. Kerderen did not understand, but he vaguely suspected
something without divining what it could be.
They did not say a word to one another until they reached their
usual halting-place, where, from their constant sitting in the
same spot the grass was quite worn away. They ate their breakfast
slowly. Neither of them felt hungry.
Before long the girl appeared. As on every Sunday, they watched
her coming. When she was quite near, Luc rose and made two steps
forward. She put her milk-pail on the ground and kissed him. She
kissed him passionately, throwing her arms about his neck,
without noticing Jean, without remembering that he was there,
without even seeing him.
And he sat there desperate, poor Jean, so desperate that he did
not understand, his soul quite overwhelmed, his heart bursting,
but not yet understanding himself. Then the girl seated herself
beside Luc, and they began to chatter.
Jean did not look at them. He now divined why his comrade had
gone out twice during the week, and he felt within him a burning
grief, a kind of wound, that sense of rending which is caused by
treason.
Luc and the girl went off together to change the position of the
cow. Jean followed them with his eyes. He saw them departing side
by side. The red breeches of his comrade made a bright spot on
the road. It was Luc who picked up the mallet and hammered down
the stake to which they tied the beast.
The girl stooped to milk her, while he stroked the cow's sharp
spine with a careless hand. Then they left the milk-pail on the
grass, and went deep into the wood.
Jean saw nothing but the wall of leaves where they had entered;
and he felt himself so troubled that if he had tried to rise he
would certainly have fallen. He sat motionless, stupefied by
astonishment and suffering, with an agony which was simple but
deep. He wanted to cry, to run away, to hide himself, never to
see anybody any more.
Soon he saw them issuing from the thicket. They returned slowly,
holding each other's hands as in the villages do those who are
promised. It was Luc who carried the pail.
They kissed one another again before they separated, and the girl
went off after having thrown Jean a friendly "Good evening" and a
smile which was full of meaning. To-day she no longer thought of
offering him any milk.
The two little soldiers sat side by side, motionless as usual,
silent and calm, their placid faces betraying nothing of all
which troubled their hearts. The sun fell on them. Sometimes the
cow lowed, looking at them from afar.
At their usual hour they rose to go back. Luc cut a switch. Jean
carried the empty bottle to return it to the wine-seller at
Bezons. Then they sallied out upon the bridge, and, as they did
every Sunday, stopped several minutes in the middle to watch the
water flowing.
Jean leaned, leaned more and more, over the iron railing, as
though he saw in the current something which attracted him. Luc
said: "Are you trying to drink?" Just as he uttered the last word
Jean's head overbalanced his body, his legs described a circle in
the air, and the little blue and red soldier fell in a heap,
struck the water, and disappeared.
Luc, his tongue paralyzed with anguish, tried in vain to shout.
Farther down he saw something stir; then the head of his comrade
rose to the surface of the river and sank immediately. Farther
still he again perceived a hand, a single hand, which issued from
the stream and then disappear. That was all.
The bargemen who dragged the river did not find the body that
day.
Luc set out alone for the barracks, going at a run, his soul
filled with despair. He told of the accident, with tears in his
eyes, and a husky voice, blowing his nose again and again: "He
leaned over--he--he leaned over--so far--so far that his head
turned a somersault; and--and--so he fell--he fell--"
Choked with emotion, he could say no more. If he had only known!
GHOSTS
Just at the time when the Concordat was in its most flourishing
condition, a young man belonging to a wealthy and highly
respectable middle-class family went to the office of the head of
the police at P----, and begged for his help and advice, which
was immediately promised him.
"My father threatens to disinherit me," the young man began,
"although I have never offended against the laws of the State, of
morality, or against his paternal authority, merely because I do
not share his blind reverence for the Catholic Church and her
clergy. On that account he looks upon me, not merely as
Latitudinarian but as a perfect Atheist, and a faithful old
manservant of ours, who is much attached to me, and who
accidentally saw my father's will, told me in confidence that he
had left all his property to the Jesuits. I think this is highly
suspicious, and I fear that the priests have been maligning me to
my father. Until less than a year ago, we used to live very
quietly and happily together, but ever since he has had so much
to do with the clergy, our domestic peace and happiness are at an
end."
"What you have told me," replied the official, "is as likely as
it is regrettable, but I fail to see how I can interfere in the
matter. Your father is in full possession of all his mental
faculties, and can dispose of all his property exactly as he
pleases. I think that your protest is premature; you must wait
until his will can legally take effect, and then you can invoke
the aid of justice. I am sorry to say that just now I can do
nothing for you."
"I think you will be able to," the young man replied; "for I
believe that a very clever piece of deceit is being carried on."
"How? Please explain yourself more clearly."
"When I remonstrated with him, yesterday evening, he referred to
my dead mother, and at last assured me, in a voice of the deepest
conviction, that she had frequently appeared to him, had
threatened him with all the torments of the damned, if he did not
disinherit his son, who had fallen away from God, and leave all
his property to the Church. Now I do not believe in ghosts."
"Neither do I," the police director replied, "but I cannot well
do anything on such grounds, having nothing but superstitions to
go upon. You know how the Church rules all our affairs since the
Concordat with Rome, and if I investigate this matter and obtain
no results, I am risking my post. It would be very different if
you could adduce any proofs for your suspicions. I do not deny
that I should like to see the clerical party, which will, I fear,
be the ruin of Austria, receive a staggering blow; try,
therefore, to get to the bottom of this business, and then we
will talk it over again."
About a month passed, without the young Latitudinarian being
heard of. Suddenly, he came one evening, in a great state of
excitement, and told the Inspector that he was in a position to
expose the priestly deceit which he had mentioned, if the
authorities would assist him. The police director asked for
further information.
"I have obtained a number of important clues," said the young
man. "In the first place, my father confessed to me that my
mother did not appear to him in our house, but in the churchyard
where she is buried. My mother was consumptive for many years,
and a few weeks before her death she went to the village of
S----, where she died and was buried. In addition to this, I
found out from our footman that my father has already left the
house twice, late at night, in company of X----, the Jesuit
priest, and that on both occasions he did not return till
morning. Each time he was remarkably uneasy and low-spirited
after his return, and had three masses said for my dead mother.
He also told me just now that he has to leave home this evening
on business, but, immediately after he told me that, our footman
saw the Jesuit go out of the house. We may, therefore, assume
that he intends this evening to consult the spirit of my dead
mother again, and this would be an excellent opportunity to solve
the matter, if you do not object to opposing the most powerful
force in the Empire for the sake of such an insignificant
individual as myself."
"Every citizen has an equal right to the protection of the
State," the police director replied; "and I think that I have
shown often enough that I am not wanting in courage to perform my
duty, no matter how serious the consequences may be. But only
very young men act without any prospects of success, because they
are carried away by their feelings. When you came to me the first
time, I was obliged to refuse your request for assistance, but
to-day your request is just and reasonable. It is now eight
o'clock; I shall expect you in two hours' time, here in my
office. At present, all you have to do is to hold your tongue;
everything else is my affair."
As soon as it was dark, four men got into a closed carriage in
the yard of the police-office, and were driven in the direction
of the village of S----. Their carriage, however, did not enter
the village, but stopped at the edge of a small wood in the
immediate neighborhood. Here all four alighted: the police
director, accompanied by the young Latitudinarian, a police
sergeant, and an ordinary policeman, the latter however, dressed
in plain clothes.
"The first thing for us to do is to examine the locality
carefully," said the police director. "It is eleven o'clock and
the exorcisers of ghosts will not arrive before midnight, so we
have time to look round us, and to lay our plans."
The four men went to the churchyard, which lay at the end of the
village, near the little wood. Everything was as still as death,
and not a soul was to be seen. The sexton was evidently sitting
in the public house, for they found the door of his cottage
locked, as well as the door of the little chapel that stood in
the middle of the churchyard.
"Where is your mother's grave?" the police director asked. As
there were only a few stars visible, it was not easy to find it,
but at last they managed it, and the police director surveyed the
neighborhood of it.
"The position is not a very favorable one for us," he said at
last; "there is nothing here, not even a shrub, behind which we
could hide."
But just then, the policeman reported that he had tried to get
into the sexton's hut through the door or a window, and that at
last he had succeeded in doing so by breaking open a square in a
window which had been mended with paper, that he had opened it
and obtained possession of the key, which he brought to the
police director.
The plans were very quickly settled. The police director had the
chapel opened and went in with the young Latitudinarian; then he
told the police sergeant to lock the door behind him and to put
the key back where he had found it, and to shut the window of the
sexton's cottage carefully. Lastly, he made arrangements as to
what they were to do, in case anything unforeseen should occur,
whereupon the sergeant and the constable left the churchyard, and
lay down in a ditch at some distance from the gate, but opposite
to it.
Almost as soon as the clock struck half past eleven, they heard
steps near the chapel, whereupon the police director and the
young Latitudinarian went to the window in order to watch the
beginning of the exorcism, and as the chapel was in total
darkness, they thought that they should be able to see without
being seen; but matters turned out differently from what they
expected.
Suddenly, the key turned in the lock. They barely had time to
conceal themselves behind the altar, before two men came in, one
of whom was carrying a dark lantern. One was the young man's
father, an elderly man of the middle class, who seemed very
unhappy and depressed, the other the Jesuit father X----, a tall,
lean, big-boned man, with a thin, bilious face, in which two
large gray eyes shone restlessly under bushy, black eyebrows. He
lit the tapers, which were standing on the altar, and began to
say a "Requiem Mass"; while the old man kneeled on the altar
steps and served him.
When it was over, the Jesuit took the book of the Gospels and the
holy-water sprinkler, and went slowly out of the chapel, the old
man following him with the holy-water basin in one hand, and a
taper in the other. Then the police director left his hiding
place, and stooping down, so as not to be seen, crept to the
chapel window, where he cowered down carefully; the young man
followed his example. They were now looking straight at his
mother's grave.
The Jesuit, followed by the superstitious old man, walked three
times round the grave; then he remained standing before it, and
by the light of the taper read a few passages from the Gospel.
Then he dipped the holy-water sprinkler three times into the
holy-water basin, and sprinkled the grave three times. Then both
returned to the chapel, kneeled down outside it with their faces
toward the grave, and began to pray aloud, until at last the
Jesuit sprang up, in a species of wild ecstasy, and cried out
three times in a shrill voice:
"Exsurge! Exsurge! Exsurge!"[1]
[1] Arise!
Scarcely had the last words of the exorcism died away, when
thick, blue smoke rose out of the grave, rapidly grew into a
cloud, and began to assume the outlines of a human body, until at
last a tall, white figure stood behind the grave, and beckoned
with its hand.
"Who art thou?" the Jesuit asked solemnly, while the old man
began to cry.
"When I was alive, I was called Anna Maria B----," replied the
ghost in a hollow voice.
"Will you answer all my questions?" the priest continued.
"As far as I can."
"Have you not yet been delivered from purgatory by our prayers,
and by all the Masses for your soul, which we have said for you?"
"Not yet, but soon, soon I shall be."
"When?"
"As soon as that blasphemer, my son, has been punished."
"Has that not already happened? Has not your husband disinherited
his lost son, and in his place made the Church his heir?"
"That is not enough."
"What must he do besides?"
"He must deposit his will with the Judicial Authorities, as his
last will and testament, and drive the reprobate out of his
house."
"Consider well what you are saying; must this really be?"
"It must, or otherwise I shall have to languish in purgatory much
longer," the sepulchral voice replied with a deep sigh; but the
next moment the ghost yelled out in terror: "Oh! Good Lord!" and
began to run away as fast as it could. A shrill whistle was
heard, and then another, and the police director laid his hand on
the shoulder of the exorciser with the remark:
"You are in custody."
Meanwhile, the police sergeant and the policeman, who had come
into the churchyard, had caught the ghost, and dragged it
forward. It was the sexton, who had put on a flowing, white
dress, and wore a wax mask, which bore a striking resemblance to
his mother, so the son declared.
When the case was heard, it was proved that the mask had been
very skillfully made from a portrait of the deceased woman. The
government gave orders that the matter should be investigated as
secretly as possible, and left the punishment of Father X----to
the spiritual authorities, which was a matter of necessity, at a
time when priests were outside of the jurisdiction of the civil
authorities. It is needless to say that Father X----was very
comfortable during his imprisonment in a monastery, in a part of
the country which abounded with game and trout.
The only valuable result of the amusing ghost story was that it
brought about a reconciliation between father and son; the
former, as a matter of fact, felt such deep respect for priests
and their ghosts in consequence of the apparition, that a short
time after his wife had left purgatory for the last time in order
to talk with him, he turned Protestant.
WAS IT A DREAM?
"I had loved her madly!
"Why does one love? Why does one love? How queer it is to see
only one being in the world, to have only one thought in one's
mind, only one desire in the heart, and only one name on the
lips--a name which comes up continually, rising, like the water
in a spring, from the depths of the soul to the lips, a name
which one repeats over and over again, which one whispers
ceaselessly, everywhere, like a prayer.
"I am going to tell you our story, for love only has one, which
is always the same. I met her and loved her; that is all. And for
a whole year I have lived on her tenderness, on her caresses, in
her arms, in her dresses, on her words, so completely wrapped up,
bound, and absorbed in everything which came from her, that I no
longer cared whether it was day or night, or whether I was dead
or alive, on this old earth of ours.
"And then she died. How? I do not know; I no longer know
anything. But one evening she came home wet, for it was raining
heavily, and the next day she coughed, and she coughed for about
a week, and took to her bed. What happened I do not remember now,
but doctors came, wrote, and went away. Medicines were brought,
and some women made her drink them. Her hands were hot, her
forehead was burning, and her eyes bright and sad. When I spoke
to her, she answered me, but I do not remember what we said. I
have forgotten everything, everything, everything! She died, and
I very well remember her slight, feeble sigh. The nurse said:
'Ah!' and I understood, I understood!
"I knew nothing more, nothing. I saw a priest, who said: 'Your
mistress?' and it seemed to me as if he were insulting her. As
she was dead, nobody had the right to say that any longer, and I
turned him out. Another came who was very kind and tender, and I
shed tears when he spoke to me about her.
"They consulted me about the funeral, but I do not remember
anything that they said, though I recollected the coffin, and the
sound of the hammer when they nailed her down in it. Oh! God,
God!
"She was buried! Buried! She! In that hole! Some people
came--female friends. I made my escape and ran away. I ran, and
then walked through the streets, went home, and the next day
started on a journey.
 * * * * * * *
"Yesterday I returned to Paris, and when I saw my room again--our
room, our bed, our furniture, everything that remains of the life
of a human being after death--I was seized by such a violent
attack of fresh grief, that I felt like opening the window and
throwing myself out into the street. I could not remain any
longer among these things, between these walls which had inclosed
and sheltered her, which retained a thousand atoms of her, of her
skin and of her breath, in their imperceptible crevices. I took
up my hat to make my escape, and just as I reached the door, I
passed the large glass in the hall, which she had put there so
that she might look at herself every day from head to foot as she
went out, to see if her toilette looked well, and was correct and
pretty, from her little boots to her bonnet.
"I stopped short in front of that looking-glass in which she had
so often been reflected--so often, so often, that it must have
retained her reflection. I was standing there. trembling, with my
eyes fixed on the glass--on that flat, profound, empty
glass--which had contained her entirely, and had possessed her as
much as I, as my passionate looks had. I felt as if I loved that
glass. I touched it; it was cold. Oh! the recollection! sorrowful
mirror, burning mirror, horrible mirror, to make men suffer such
torments! Happy is the man whose heart forgets everything that it
has contained, everything that has passed before it, everything
that has looked at itself in it, or has been reflected in its
affection, in its love! How I suffer!
"I went out without knowing it, without wishing it, and toward
the cemetery. I found her simple grave, a white marble cross,
with these few words:
          " 'She loved, was loved, and died.'
"She is there, below, decayed! How horrible! I sobbed with my
forehead on the ground, and I stopped there for a long time, a
long time. Then I saw that it was getting dark, and a strange,
mad wish, the wish of a despairing lover, seized me. I wished to
pass the night, the last night, in weeping on her grave. But I
should be seen and driven out. How was I to manage? I was
cunning, and got up and began to roam about in that city of the
dead. I walked and walked. How small this city is, in comparison
with the other, the city in which we live. And yet, how much more
numerous the dead are than the living. We want high houses, wide
streets, and much room for the four generations who see the
daylight at the same time, drink water from the spring, and wine
from the vines, and eat bread from the plains.
"And for all the generations of the dead, for all that ladder of
humanity that has descended down to us, there is scarcely
anything, scarcely anything! The earth takes them back, and
oblivion effaces them. Adieu!
"At the end of the cemetery, I suddenly perceived that I was in
its oldest part, where those who had been dead a long time are
mingling with the soil, where the crosses themselves are decayed,
where possibly newcomers will be put to-morrow. It is full of
untended roses, of strong and dark cypress-trees, a sad and
beautiful garden, nourished on human flesh.
"I was alone, perfectly alone. So I crouched in a green tree and
hid myself there completely amid the thick and somber branches. I
waited, clinging to the stem, like a shipwrecked man does to a
plank.
"When it was quite dark, I left my refuge and began to walk
softly, slowly, inaudibly, through that ground full of dead
people. I wandered about for a long time, but could not find her
tomb again. I went on with extended arms, knocking against the
tombs with my hands, my feet, my knees, my chest, even with my
head, without being able to find her. I groped about like a blind
man finding his way, I felt the stones, the crosses, the iron
railings, the metal wreaths, and the wreaths of faded flowers! I
read the names with my fingers, by passing them over the letters.
What a night! What a night! I could not find her again!
"There was no moon. What a night! I was frightened, horribly
frightened in these narrow paths, between two rows of graves.
Graves! graves! graves! nothing but graves! On my right, on my
left, in front of me, around me, everywhere there were graves! I
sat down on one of them, for I could not walk any longer, my
knees were so weak. I could hear my heart beat! And I heard
something else as well. What? A confused, nameless noise. Was the
noise in my head, in the impenetrable night, or beneath the
mysterious earth, the earth sown with human corpses? I looked all
around me, but I cannot say how long I remained there; I was
paralyzed with terror, cold with fright, ready to shout out,
ready to die.
"Suddenly, it seemed to me that the slab of marble on which I was
sitting, was moving. Certainly it was moving, as if it were being
raised. With a bound, I sprang on to the neighboring tomb, and I
saw, yes, I distinctly saw the stone which I had just quitted
rise upright. Then the dead person appeared, a naked skeleton,
pushing the stone back with its bent back. I saw it quite
clearly, although the night was so dark. On the cross I could
read:
" 'Here lies Jacques Olivant, who died at the age of fifty-one.
He loved his family, was kind and honorable, and died in the
grace of the Lord.'
"The dead man also read what was inscribed on his tombstone; then
he picked up a stone off the path, a little, pointed stone and
began to scrape the letters carefully. He slowly effaced them,
and with the hollows of his eyes he looked at the places where
they had been engraved. Then with the tip of the bone that had
been his forefinger, he wrote in luminous letters, like those
lines which boys trace on walls with the tip of a lucifer match:
" 'Here reposes Jacques Olivant, who died at the age of
fifty-one. He hastened his father's death by his unkindness, as
he wished to inherit his fortune, he tortured his wife, tormented
his children, deceived his neighbors, robbed everyone he could,
and died wretched.'
"When he had finished writing, the dead man stood motionless,
looking at his work. On turning round I saw that all the graves
were open, that all the dead bodies had emerged from them, and
that all had effaced the lies inscribed on the gravestones by
their relations, substituting the truth instead. And I saw that
all had been the tormentors of their neighbors--malicious,
dishonest, hypocrites, liars, rogues, calumniators, envious; that
they had stolen, deceived, performed every disgraceful, every
abominable action, these good fathers, these faithful wives,
these devoted sons, these chaste daughters, these honest
tradesmen, these men and women who were called irreproachable.
They were all writing at the same time, on the threshold of their
eternal abode, the truth, the terrible and the holy truth of
which everybody was ignorant, or pretended to be ignorant, while
they were alive.
"I thought that SHE also must have written something on her
tombstone, and now running without any fear among the half-open
coffins, among the corpses and skeletons, I went toward her, sure
that I should find her immediately. I recognized her at once,
without seeing her face, which was covered by the winding-sheet,
and on the marble cross, where shortly before I had read:
          " 'She loved, was loved, and died.'
I now saw:
" 'Having gone out in the rain one day, in order to deceive her
lover, she caught cold and died.'
 * * * * * * *
"It appears that they found me at daybreak, lying on the grave
unconscious."
THE DIARY OF A MADMAN
He was dead--the head of a high tribunal, the upright magistrate,
whose irreproachable life was a proverb in all the courts of
France. Advocates, young counselors, judges had saluted, bowing
low in token of profound respect, remembering that grand face,
pale and thin, illumined by two bright, deep-set eyes.
He had passed his life in pursuing crime and in protecting the
weak. Swindlers and murderers had no more redoubtable enemy, for
he seemed to read in the recesses of their souls their most
secret thoughts.
He was dead, now, at the age of eighty-two, honored by the homage
and followed by the regrets of a whole people. Soldiers in red
breeches had escorted him to the tomb, and men in white cravats
had shed on his grave tears that seemed to be real.
But listen to the strange paper found by the dismayed notary in
the desk where the judge had kept filed the records of great
criminals! It was entitled:
                    WHY?
June 20, 1851. I have just left court. I have condemned Blondel
to death! Now, why did this man kill his five children?
Frequently one meets with people to whom killing is a pleasure.
Yes, yes, it should be a pleasure--the greatest of all, perhaps,
for is not killing most like creating? To make and to destroy!
These two words contain the history of the universe, the history
of all worlds, all that is, all! Why is it not intoxicating to
kill?
June 25. To think that there is a being who lives, who walks, who
runs. A being? What is a being? An animated thing which bears in
it the principle of motion, and a will ruling that principle. It
clings to nothing, this thing. Its feet are independent of the
ground. It is a grain of life that moves on the earth, and this
grain of life, coming I know not whence, one can destroy at one's
will. Then nothing nothing more. It perishes; it is finished.
June 26. Why, then, is it a crime to kill? Yes, why? On the
contrary, it is the law of nature. Every being has the mission to
kill; he kills to live, and he lives to kill. The beast kills
without ceasing, all day, every instant of its existence. Man
kills without ceasing, to nourish himself; but since in addition
he needs to kill for pleasure, he has invented the chase! The
child kills the insects he finds, the little birds, all the
little animals that come in his way. But this does not suffice
for the irresistible need of massacre that is in us. It is not
enough to kill beasts; we must kill man too. Long ago this need
was satisfied by human sacrifice. Now, the necessity of living in
society has made murder a crime. We condemn and punish the
assassin! But as we cannot live without yielding to this natural
and imperious instinct of death, we relieve ourselves from time
to time, by wars. Then a whole nation slaughters another nation.
It is a feast of blood, a feast that maddens armies and
intoxicates the civilians, women and children, who read, by
lamplight at night, the feverish story of massacre.
And do we despise those picked out to accomplish these butcheries
of men? No, they are loaded with honors. They are clad in gold
and in resplendent stuffs; they wear plumes on their heads and
ornaments on their breasts; and they are given crosses, rewards,
titles of every kind. They are proud, respected, loved by women,
cheered by the crowd, solely because their mission is to shed
human blood! They drag through the streets their instruments of
death, and the passer-by, clad in black, looks on with envy. For
to kill is the great law put by nature in the heart of existence!
There is nothing more beautiful and honorable than killing!
June 30. To kill is the law, because Nature loves eternal youth.
She seems to cry in all her unconscious acts: "Quick! quick!
quick!" The more she destroys, the more she renews herself.
July 2. It must be a pleasure, unique and full of zest, to kill
to place before you a living, thinking being; to make therein a
little hole, nothing but a little hole, and to see that red
liquid flow which is the blood, which is the life; and then to
have before you only a heap of limp flesh, cold, inert, void of
thought!
August 5. I, who have passed my life in judging, condemning,
killing by words pronounced, killing by the guillotine those who
had killed by the knife, if I should do as all the assassins whom
I have smitten have done, I, I--who would know it?
August 10. Who would ever know? Who would ever suspect me,
especially if I should choose a being I had no interest in doing
away with?
August 22. I could resist no longer. I have killed a little
creature as an experiment, as a beginning. Jean, my servant, had
a goldfinch in a cage hung in the office window. I sent him on an
errand, and I took the little bird in my hand, in my hand where I
felt its heart beat. It was warm. I went up to my room. From time
to time I squeezed it tighter; its heart beat faster; it was
atrocious and delicious. I was nearly choking it. But I could not
see the blood.
Then I took scissors, short nail scissors, and I cut its throat
in three strokes, quite gently. It opened its bill, it struggled
to escape me, but I held it, oh! I held it--I could have held a
mad dog--and I saw the blood trickle.
And then I did as assassins do--real ones. I washed the scissors
and washed my hands. I sprinkled water, and took the body, the
corpse, to the garden to hide it. I buried it under a
strawberry-plant. It will never be found. Every day I can eat a
strawberry from that plant. How one can enjoy life, when one
knows how!
My servant cried; he thought his bird flown. How could he suspect
me? Ah!
August 25. I must kill a man! I must!
August 30. It is done. But what a little thing! I had gone for a
walk in the forest of Vernes. I was thinking of nothing,
literally nothing. See! a child on the road, a little child
eating a slice of bread and butter. He stops to see me pass and
says, "Good day, Mr. President."
And the thought enters my head: "Shall I kill him?"
I answer: "You are alone, my boy?"
"Yes, sir."
"All alone in the wood?"
"Yes, sir."
The wish to kill him intoxicated me like wine. I approached him
quite softly, persuaded that he was going to run away. And
suddenly I seized him by the throat. He held my wrists in his
little hands, and his body writhed like a feather on the fire.
Then he moved no more. I threw the body in the ditch, then some
weeds on top of it. I returned home and dined well. What a little
thing it was! In the evening I was very gay, light, rejuvenated,
and passed the evening at the Prefect's. They found me witty. But
I have not seen blood! I am not tranquil.
August 31. The body has been discovered. They are hunting for the
assassin. Ah!
September 1. Two tramps have been arrested. Proofs are lacking.
September 2. The parents have been to see me. They wept! Ah!
October 6. Nothing has been discovered. Some strolling vagabond
must have done the deed. Ah! If I had seen the blood flow it
seems to me I should be tranquil now!
October 10. Yet another. I was walking by the river, after
breakfast. And I saw, under a willow, a fisherman asleep. It was
noon. A spade, as if expressly put there for me, was standing in
a potato-field near by.
I took it. I returned; I raised it like a club, and with one blow
of the edge I cleft the fisherman's head. Oh! he bled, this
one!--rose-colored blood. It flowed into the water quite gently.
And I went away with a grave step. If I had been seen! Ah! I
should have made an excellent assassin.
October 25. The affair of the fisherman makes a great noise. His
nephew, who fished with him, is charged with the murder.
October 26. The examining magistrate affirms that the nephew is
guilty. Everybody in town believes it. Ah! ah!
October 27. The nephew defends himself badly. He had gone to the
village to buy bread and cheese, he declares. He swears that his
uncle had been killed in his absence! Who would believe him?
October 28. The nephew has all but confessed, so much have they
made him lose his head! Ah! Justice!
November 15. There are overwheming proofs against the nephew, who
was his uncle's heir. I shall preside at the sessions.
January 25, 1852. To death! to death! to death! I have had him
condemned to death! The advocate-general spoke like an angel! Ah!
Yet another! I shall go to see him executed!
March 10. It is done. They guillotined him this morning. He died
very well! very well! That gave me pleasure! How fine it is to
see a man's head cut off!
Now, I shall wait, I can wait. It would take such a little thing
to let myself be caught.

The manuscript contained more pages, but told of no new crime.
Alienist physicians to whom the awful story has been submitted
declare that there are in the world many unknown madmen; as
adroit and as terrible as this monstrous lunatic.
AN UNFORTUNATE LIKENESS
It was during one of those sudden changes of the electric light,
which at one time throws rays of exquisite pale pink, of a liquid
gold filtered through the light hair of a woman, and at another,
rays of bluish hue with strange tints, such as the sky assumes at
twilight, in which the women with their bare shoulders looked
like living flowers--it was, I say, on the night of the first of
January at Montonirail's, the dainty painter of tall, undulating
figures, of bright dresses, of Parisian prettiness--that tall
Pescarelle, whom some called "Pussy," though I do not know why,
suddenly said in a low voice:
"Well, people were not altogether mistaken, in fact, were only
half wrong when they coupled my name with that of pretty Lucy
Plonelle. She had caught me, just as a birdcatcher on a frosty
morning catches an imprudent wren on a limed twig--in fact, she
might have done whatever she liked with me.
"I was under the charm of her enigmatical and mocking smile, that
smile in which her teeth gleamed cruelly between her red lips,
and glistened as if they were ready to bite and to heighten the
pleasure of the most delightful, the most voluptuous, kiss by
pain.
"I loved everything in her--her feline suppleness, her languid
looks which emerged from her half-closed lids, full of promises
and temptation, her somewhat extreme elegance, and her hands,
those long, delicate white hands, with blue veins, like the
bloodless hands of a female saint in a stained glass window, and
her slender fingers, on which only the large blood-drop of a ruby
glittered.
"I would have given her all my remaining youth and vigor to have
laid my burning hands upon the back of her cool, round neck, and
to feel that bright, silk, golden mane enveloping me and
caressing my skin. I was never tired of hearing her disdainful,
petulant voice, those vibrations which sounded as if they
proceeded from clear glass, whose music, at times, became hoarse,
harsh, and fierce, like the loud, sonorous calls of the
Valkyries.
"Good heavens! to be her lover, to be her chattel, to belong to
her, to devote one's whole existence to her, to spend one's last
half-penny and to sink in misery, only to have the glory and the
happiness of possessing her splendid beauty, the sweetness of her
kisses, the pink and the white of her demonlike soul all to
myself, if only for a few months!
"It makes you laugh, I know, to think that I should have been
caught like that--I who give such good, prudent advice to my
friends--I who fear love as I do those quicksands and shoals
which appear at low tide and in which one may be swallowed up and
disappear!
"But who can answer for himself, who can defend himself against
such a danger, as the magnetic attraction that inheres in such a
woman? Nevertheless, I got cured and perfectly cured, and that
quite accidentally. This is how the enchantment, which was
apparently so infrangible, was broken.
"On the first night of a play, I was sitting in the stalls close
to Lucy, whose mother had accompanied her, as usual. They
occupied the front of a box, side by side. From some
unsurmountable attraction, I never ceased looking at the woman
whom I loved with all the force of my being. I feasted my eyes on
her beauty, I saw nobody except her in the theater, and did not
listen to the piece that was being performed on the stage.
"Suddenly, however, I felt as if I had received a blow from a
dagger in my heart, and I had an insane hallucination. Lucy had
moved, and her pretty head was in profile, in the same attitude
and with the same lines as her mother. I do not know what shadow
or what play of light had hardened and altered the color of her
delicate features, effacing their ideal prettiness, but the more
I looked at them both, at the one who was young and the one who
was old, the greater the distressing resemblance became.
"I saw Lucy growing older and older, striving against those
accumulating years which bring wrinkles in the face, produce a
double chin and crow's-feet, and spoil the mouth. THEY ALMOST
LOOKED LIKE TWINS.
"I suffered so, that I thought I should go mad. Yet in spite of
myself, instead of shaking off this feeling and making my escape
out of the theater, far away into the noise and life of the
boulevards, I persisted in looking at the other, at the old one,
in examining her, in judging her, in dissecting her with my eyes.
I got excited over her flabby cheeks, over those ridiculous
dimples, that were half filled up, over that treble chin, that
dyed hair, those lusterless eyes, and that nose, which was a
caricature of Lucy's beautiful, attractive little nose.
"I had a prescience of the future. I loved her, and I should love
her more and more every day, that little sorceress who had so
despotically and so quickly conquered me. I should not allow any
participation or any intrigue from the day she gave herself to
me, and once intimately connected, who could tell whether, just
as I was defending myself against it most, the legitimate
termination--marriage--might not come?
"Why not give one's name to a woman whom one loves, and whom one
trusts? The reason was that I should be tied to a disfigured,
ugly creature, with whom I should not venture to be seen in
public. My friends would leer at her with laughter in their eyes,
and with pity in their hearts for the man who was accompanying
those remains.
"And so, as soon as the curtain had fallen, without saying good
day or good evening, I had myself driven to the Moulin Rouge.
 * * * * * * *
"Well," Florise d'Anglet exclaimed, "I shall never take mamma to
the theater with me again, for the men are really going crazy!"
A COUNTRY EXCURSION
For five months they had been talking of going to lunch at some
country restaurant in the neighborhood of Paris, on Madame
Dufour's birthday, and as they were looking forward very
impatiently to the outing, they had risen very early that
morning. Monsieur Dufour had borrowed the milkman's tilted cart,
and drove himself. It was a very neat, two wheeled conveyance,
with a hood, and in it Madame Dufour, resplendent in a wonderful,
sherry-colored silk dress, sat by the side of her husband.
The old grandmother and the daughter were accommodated with two
chairs, and a yellow-haired youth, of whom, however, nothing was
to be seen except his head, lay at the bottom of the trap.
When they got to the bridge of Neuilly, Monsieur Dufour said:
"Here we are in the country at last!" At that warning, his wife
grew sentimental about the beauties of nature. When they got to
the crossroads at Courbevoie, they were seized with admiration
for the tremendous view down there: on the right was the spire of
Argenteuil church, above it rose the hills of Sannois and the
mill of Orgemont, while on the left, the aqueduct of Marly stood
out against the clear morning sky. In the distance they could see
the terrace of Saint-Germain, and opposite to them, at the end of
a low chain of hills, the new fort of Cormeilles. Afar--a very
long way off, beyond the plains and villages--one could see the
somber green of the forests.
The sun was beginning to shine in their faces, the dust got into
their eyes, and on either side of the road there stretched an
interminable tract of bare, ugly country, which smelled
unpleasantly. You would have thought that it had been ravaged by
a pestilence which had even attacked the buildings, for skeletons
of dilapidated and deserted houses; or small cottages left in an
unfinished state, as if the contractors had not been paid, reared
their four roofless walls on each side.
Here and there tall factory-chimneys rose up from the barren
soil, the only vegetation on that putrid land, where the spring
breezes wafted an odor of petroleum and soot, mingled with
another smell that was even still less agreeable. At last,
however, they crossed the Seine a second time. It was delightful
on the bridge; the river sparkled in the sun, and they had a
feeling of quiet satisfaction and enjoyment in drinking in purer
air, not impregnated by the black smoke of factories, nor by the
miasma from the deposits of night-soil. A man whom they met told
them that the name of the place was Bezons; so Monsieur Dufour
pulled up, and read the attractive announcement outside an
eating-house:
"Restaurant Poulin, stews and fried fish, private rooms, arbors,
and swings."
"Well! Madame Dufour, will this suit you? Will you make up your
mind at last?"
She read the announcement in her turn, and then looked at the
house for a time.
It was a white country inn, built by the road-side, and through
the open door she could see the bright zinc of the counter, at
which two workmen out for the day were sitting. At last she made
up her mind, and said:
"Yes, this will do; and, besides, there is a view."
So they drove into a large yard studded with trees, behind the
inn, which was only separated from the river by the towing-path,
and got out. The husband sprang out first, and held out his arms
for his wife. As the step was very high, Madame Dufour, in order
to reach him, had to show the lower part of her limbs, whose
former slenderness had disappeared in fat. Monsieur Dufour, who
was already getting excited by the country air, pinched her calf,
and then, taking her in his arms, set her on to the ground, as if
she had been some enormous bundle. She shook the dust out of the
silk dress, and then looked round, to see in what sort of a place
she was.
She was a stout woman, of about thirty-six, full-blown and
delightful to look at. She could hardly breathe, as she was laced
too tightly, which forced the heaving mass of her superabundant
bosom up to her double chin. Next, the girl put her hand on to
her father's shoulder, and jumped lightly down. The youth with
the yellow hair had got down by stepping on the wheel, and he
helped Monsieur Dufour to get the grandmother out. Then they
unharnessed the horse, which they tied up to a tree, and the
carriage fell back, with both shafts in the air. The man and boy
took off their coats, washed their hands in a pail of water, and
then joined the ladies, who had already taken possession of the
swings.
Mademoiselle Dufour was trying to swing herself standing up, but
she could not succeed in getting a start. She was a pretty girl
of about eighteen; one of those women who suddenly excite your
desire when you meet them in the street, and who leave you with a
vague feeling of uneasiness and of excited senses. She was tall,
had a small waist and large hips, with a dark skin, very large
eyes, and very black hair. Her dress clearly marked the outlines
of her firm, full figure, which was accentuated by the motion of
her hips as she tried to swing herself higher. Her arms were
stretched over her head to hold the rope, so that her bosom rose
at every movement she made. Her hat, which a gust of wind had
blown off, was hanging behind her, and as the swing gradually
rose higher and higher, she showed her delicate limbs up to the
knees each time, and the wind from the perfumed petticoats, more
heady than the fumes of wine, blew into the faces of her father
and friend, who were looking at her in admiration.
Sitting in the other swing, Madame Dufour kept saying in a
monotonous voice:
"Cyprian, come and swing me; do come and swing me, Cyprian!"
At last he complied, and turning up his shirt-sleeves,
as if he intended to work very hard, with much difficulty he set
his wife in motion. She clutched the two ropes, and held her legs
out straight, so as not to touch the ground. She enjoyed feeling
giddy from the motion of the swing, and her whole figure shook
like a jelly on a dish, but as she went higher and higher, she
grew too giddy and got frightened. Every time she was coming
back, she uttered a shriek, which made all the little urchins
come round, and, down below, beneath the garden hedge, she
vaguely saw a row of mischievous heads, making various grimaces
as they laughed.
When a servant girl came out, they ordered lunch.
"Some fried fish, a stewed rabbit, salad, and dessert," Madame
Dufour said, with an important air.
"Bring two quarts of beer and a bottle of claret," her husband
said.
"We will have lunch on the grass," the girl added.
The grandmother, who had an affection for cats, had been petting
one that belonged to the house, and had been bestowing the most
affectionate words on it, for the last ten minutes. The animal,
no doubt secretly pleased by her attentions, kept close to the
good woman, but just out of reach of her hand, and quietly walked
round the trees, against which she rubbed herself, with her tail
up, purring with pleasure.
"Hallo!" exclaimed the youth with the yellow hair, who was
ferreting about, "here are two swell boats!" They all went to
look at them, and saw two beautiful skiffs in a wooden boathouse,
which were as beautifully finished as if they had been objects of
luxury. They were moored side by side, like two tall, slender
girls, in their narrow shining length, and aroused in one a wish
to float in them on warm summer mornings and evenings, along
flower-covered banks of the river, where the trees dip their
branches into the water, where the rushes are continually
rustling in the breeze, and where the swift kingfishers dart
about like flashes of blue lightning.
The whole family looked at them with great respect.
"They are indeed two swell boats," Monsieur Dufour repeated
gravely, and he examined them closely, commenting on them like a
connoisseur. He had been in the habit of rowing in his younger
days, he said, and when he had that in his hands--and he went
through the action of pulling the oars--he did not care a fig for
anybody. He had beaten more than one Englishman formerly at the
Joinville regattas. He grew quite excited at last, and offered to
make a bet that in a boat like that he could row six miles an
hour, without exerting himself.
"Lunch is ready," said the waitress, appearing at the entrance to
the boathouse. They all hurried off, but two young men were
already lunching at the best place, which Madame Dufour had
chosen in her mind as her seat. No doubt they were the owners of
the skiffs, for they were dressed in boating costume. They were
stretched out, almost lying on chairs, and were sunburned, and
had on flannel trousers and thin cotton jerseys, with short
sleeves, which showed their bare arms, which were as strong as
blacksmiths'. They were two strong young fellows, who thought a
great deal of their vigor, and who showed in all their movements
that elasticity and grace of limb which can only be acquired by
exercise, and which is so different to the awkwardness with which
the same continual work stamps the mechanic.
They exchanged a rapid smile when they saw the mother, and then a
look on seeing the daughter.
"Let us give up our place," one of them said; "it will make us
acquainted with them."
The other got up immediately, and holding his black and red
boating-cap in his hand, he politely offered the ladies the only
shady place in the garden. With many excuses they accepted, and
so that it might be more rural, they sat on the grass, without
either tables or chairs.
The two young men took their plates, knives, forks, etc., to a
table a little way off, and began to eat again. Their bare arms,
which they showed continually, rather embarrassed the young girl,
who even pretended to turn her head aside, and not to see them.
But Madame Dufour, who was rather bolder, tempted by feminine
curiosity, looked at them every moment, and no doubt compared
them with the secret unsightliness of her husband. She had
squatted herself on the ground with her legs tucked under her,
after the manner of tailors, and kept wriggling about
continually, under the pretext that ants were crawling about her
somewhere. Monsieur Dufour, whom the politeness of the strangers
had put into rather a bad temper, was trying to find a
comfortable position, which he did not, however, succeed in
doing, while the youth with the yellow hair was eating as
silently as an ogre.
"It is lovely weather, Monsieur," the stout lady said to one of
the boating-men. She wished to be friendly, because they had
given up their place.
"It is, indeed, Madame," he replied; "do you often go into the
country?"
"Oh! Only once or twice a year, to get a little fresh air; and
you, Monsieur?"
"I come and sleep here every night."
"Oh! That must be very nice?"
"Certainly it is, Madame." And he gave them such a practical
account of his daily life, that in the hearts of these
shopkeepers, who were deprived of the meadows, and who longed for
country walks, it roused that innate love of nature, which they
all felt so strongly the whole year round, behind the counter in
their shop.
The girl raised her eyes and looked at the oarsman with
emotion, and Monsieur Dufour spoke for the first time.
"It is indeed a happy life," he said. And then he added: "A
little more rabbit, my dear?"
"No, thank you," she replied, and turning to the young men again,
and pointing to their arms, asked  "Do you never feel cold like
that?"
They both laughed, and amazed the family by telling of the
enormous fatigue they could endure, of bathing while in a state
of tremendous perspiration, of rowing in the fog at night, and
they struck their chests violently, to show how they sounded.
"Ah! You look very strong," the husband said and he did not talk
any more of the time when he used to beat the English. The girl
was looking at them askance now, and the young fellow with the
yellow hair, as he had swallowed some wine the wrong way, and was
coughing violently, bespattered Madame Dufour's sherry-colored
silk dress. Madame got angry, and sent for some water to wash the
spots.
Meanwhile it had grown unbearably hot, the sparkling river looked
like a blaze of fire and the fumes of the wine were getting into
their heads. Monsieur Dufour, who had a violent hiccough, had
unbuttoned his waistcoat and the top of his trousers, while his
wife, who felt choking, was gradually unfastening her dress. The
youth was shaking his yellow wig in a happy frame of mind, and
kept helping himself to wine, and as the old grandmother felt
drunk, she endeavored to be very stiff and dignified. As for the
girl, she showed nothing except a peculiar brightness in her
eyes, while the brown skin on the cheeks became more rosy.
The coffee finished them off; they spoke of singing, and each of
them sang, or repeated a couplet, which the others repeated
enthusiastically. Then they got up with some difficulty, and
while the two women, who were rather dizzy, were getting some
fresh air, the two males, who were altogether drunk, were
performing gymnastic tricks. Heavy, limp, and with scarlet faces,
they hung awkwardly on to the iron rings, without being able to
raise themselves, while their shirts were continually threatening
to part company with their trousers, and to flap in the wind like
flags.
Meanwhile, the two boating-men had got their skiffs into the
water. They came back, and politely asked the ladies whether they
would like a row.
"Would you like one, Monsieur Dufour?" his wife exclaimed.
"Please come!"
He merely gave her a drunken look, without understanding what she
said. Then one of the rowers came up, with two fishing-rods in
his hand; and the hope of catching a gudgeon, that great aim of
the Parisian shopkeeper, made Dufour's dull eyes gleam. He
politely allowed them to do whatever they liked, while he sat in
the shade, under the bridge, with his feet dangling over the
river, by the side of the young man with the yellow hair, who was
sleeping soundly close to him.
One of the boating-men made a martyr of himself, and took the
mother.
"Let us go to the little wood on the Ile aux Anglais!" he called
out, as he rowed off. The other skiff went slower, for the rower
was looking at his companion so intently, that he thought of
nothing else. His emotion paralyzed his strength, while the girl,
who was sitting on the steerer's seat, gave herself up to the
enjoyment of being on the water. She felt disinclined to think,
felt a lassitude in her limbs a complete self-relaxation, as if
she were intoxicated. She had become very flushed, and breathed
pantingly. The effect of the wine, increased by the extreme heat,
made all the trees on the bank seem to bow, as she passed. A
vague wish for enjoyment, a fermentation of her blood, seemed to
pervade her whole body, and she was also a little agitated by
this tete-a-tete on the water, in a place which seemed
depopulated by the heat, with this young man, who thought her so
pretty, whose looks seemed to caress her skin, and whose eyes
were as penetrating and exciting as the sun's rays.
Their inability to speak increased their emotion, and they looked
about them. At last he made an effort and asked her name,
"Henriette," she said.
"Why! My name is Henri," he replied. The sound of their voices
calmed them, and they looked at the banks. The other skiff had
gone ahead of them, and seemed to be waiting for them. The rower
called out:
"We will meet you in the wood; we are going as far as
Robinson's,[1] because Madame Dufour is thirsty." Then he bent
over his oars again and rowed off so quickly that he was soon out
of sight.
[1] A well-known restaurant on the banks of the Seine, much
frequented by the bourgeoisie.
Meanwhile, a continual roar, which they had heard for some time,
came nearer, and the river itself seemed to shiver, as if the
dull noise were rising from its depths.
"What is that noise?" she asked. It was the noise of the weir,
which cut the river in two, at the island. He was explaining it
to her, when above the noise of the waterfall they heard the song
of a bird, which seemed a long way off.
"Listen!" he said; "the nightingales are singing during the day,
so the females must be sitting."
A nightingale! She had never heard one before, and the idea of
listening to one roused visions of poetic tenderness in her
heart. A nightingale! That is to say, the invisible witness of
the lover's interview which Juliette invoked on her balcony[2];
that celestial music which is attuned to human kisses; that
eternal inspirer of all those languorous romances which open
idealized visions to the poor, tender, little hearts of sensitive
girls!
[2] "Romeo and Juliet," Act III., Scene V.
She wanted to hear a nightingale.
"We must not make a noise," her companion said, "and then we can
go into the wood, and sit down close to it."
The skiff seemed to glide. They saw the trees on the island, the
banks of which were so low that they could look into the depths
of the thickets. They stopped, he made the boat fast, Henriette
took hold of Henri's arm, and they went beneath the trees.
"Stoop," he said, so she bent down, and they went into an
inextricable thicket of creepers, leaves, and reed-grass, which
formed an impenetrable retreat, and which the young man
laughingly called "his private room."
Just above their heads, perched in one of the trees which hid
them, the bird was still singing. He uttered shakes and roulades,
and then long, vibrating sounds that filled the air and seemed to
lose themselves in the distance, across the level country,
through that burning silence which hung low upon the whole
country round. They did not speak for fear of frightening the
bird away. They were sitting close together, and slowly Henri's
arm stole round the girl's waist and squeezed it gently. She took
that daring hand, but without anger, and kept removing it
whenever he put it round her; not, however, feeling at all
embarrassed by this caress, just as if it had been something
quite natural which she was resisting just as naturally.
She was listening to the bird in ecstasy. She felt an infinite
longing for happiness, for some sudden demonstration of
tenderness, for a revelation of divine poesy. She felt such a
softening at her heart, and such a relaxation of her nerves, that
she began to cry, without knowing why. The young man was now
straining her close to him, and she did not remove his arm; she
did not think of it. Suddenly the nightingale stopped, and a
voice called out in the distance:
"Henriette!"
"Do not reply," he said in a low voice, "you will drive the bird
away."
But she had no idea of doing so, and they remained in the same
position for some time. Madame Dufour had sat down somewhere or
other, for from time to time they heard the stout lady break out
into little bursts of laughter.
The girl was still crying; she was filled with strange
sensations. Henri's head was on her shoulder, and suddenly he
kissed her on the lips. She was surprised and angry, and, to
avoid him, she stood up.
They were both very pale when they quitted their grassy retreat.
The blue sky looked dull to them, the ardent sun was clouded over
to their eyes, they perceived not the solitude and the silence.
They walked quickly side by side, without speaking or touching
each other, appearing to be irreconcilable enemies, as if disgust
had sprung up between them, and hatred between their souls. From
time to time Henriette called out: "Mamma!"
By and by they heard a noise in a thicket, and Madame Dufour
appeared, looking rather confused, and her companion's face was
wrinkled with smiles that he could not check.
Madame Dufour took his arm, and they returned to the boats. Henri
went on first, still without speaking, by the girl's side, and at
last they got back to Bezons. Monsieur Dufour, who had sobered
up, was waiting for them very impatiently, while the youth with
the yellow hair was having a mouthful of something to eat before
leaving the inn. The carriage was in the yard, with the horse in,
and the grandmother, who had already got in, was frightened at
the thought of being overtaken by night, before they got back to
Paris, the outskirts not being safe.
The young men shook hands with them, and the Dufour family drove
off.
"Good-bye, until we meet again!" the oarsmen cried, and the
answers they got were a sigh and a tear.
 * * * * * * *
Two months later, as Henri was going along the Rue des Martyrs,
he saw "Dufour, Ironmonger," over a door. So he went in, and saw
the stout lady sitting at the counter. They recognized each other
immediately, and after an interchange of polite greetings, he
inquired after them all.
"And how is Mademoiselle Henriette?" he inquired, specially.
"Very well, thank you; she is married."
"Ah!" Mastering his feelings, he added: "To whom was she
married?"
"To that young man who went with us, you know; he has joined us
in business."
"I remember him, perfectly."
He was going out, feeling unhappy, though scarcely knowing why,
when Madame called him back.
"And how is your friend?" she asked, rather shyly.
"He is very well, thank you."
"Please give him our compliments, and beg him to come and call
when he is in the neighborhood." She then added: "Tell him it
will give me great pleasure."
"I will be sure to do so. Adieu!"
"I will not say that; come again, very soon."
 * * * * * * *
The next year, one very hot Sunday, all the details of that
memorable adventure suddenly came back to him so clearly that he
revisited the "private room" in the wood, and was overwhelmed
with astonishment when he went in. She was sitting on the grass,
looking very sad, while by her side, again in his shirt-sleeves,
the young man with the yellow hair was sleeping soundly, like
some brute.
She grew so pale when she saw Henri, that at first he thought she
was going to faint; then, however, they began to talk quite
naturally. But when he told her that he was very fond of that
spot, and went there very often on Sundays, she looked into his
eyes for a long time. "I, too, often think of it," she replied.
"Come, my dear," her husband said, with a yawn; "I think it is
time for us to be going."

　　Chapter I
　　THE MAGNET ATTRACTING--A WAIF AMID FORCES
　　When Caroline Meeber boarded the afternoon train for Chicago, hertotal outfit consisted of a small trunk, a cheap imitationalligator-skin satchel, a small lunch in a paper box, and ayellow leather snap purse, containing her ticket, a scrap ofpaper with her sister's address in Van Buren Street, and fourdollars in money.  It was in August, 1889.  She was eighteenyears of age, bright, timid, and full of the illusions ofignorance and youth.  Whatever touch of regret at partingcharacterised her thoughts, it was certainly not for advantagesnow being given up.  A gush of tears at her mother's farewellkiss, a touch in her throat when the cars clacked by the flourmill where her father worked by the day, a pathetic sigh as thefamiliar green environs of the village passed in review, and thethreads which bound her so lightly to girlhood and home wereirretrievably broken.
　　To be sure there was always the next station, where one mightdescend and return.  There was the great city, bound more closelyby these very trains which came up daily.  Columbia City was notso very far away, even once she was in Chicago.  What, pray, is afew hours--a few hundred miles?  She looked at the little slipbearing her sister's address and wondered.  She gazed at thegreen landscape, now passing in swift review, until her swifterthoughts replaced its impression with vague conjectures of whatChicago might be.
　　When a girl leaves her home at eighteen, she does one of twothings.  Either she falls into saving hands and becomes better,or she rapidly assumes the cosmopolitan standard of virtue andbecomes worse.  Of an intermediate balance, under thecircumstances, there is no possibility.  The city has its cunningwiles, no less than the infinitely smaller and more humantempter.  There are large forces which allure with all thesoulfulness of expression possible in the most cultured human.The gleam of a thousand lights is often as effective as thepersuasive light in a wooing and fascinating eye.  Half theundoing of the unsophisticated and natural mind is accomplishedby forces wholly superhuman.  A blare of sound, a roar of life, avast array of human hives, appeal to the astonished senses inequivocal terms.  Without a counsellor at hand to whispercautious interpretations, what falsehoods may not these thingsbreathe into the unguarded ear!  Unrecognised for what they are,their beauty, like music, too often relaxes, then weakens, thenperverts the simpler human perceptions.
　　Caroline, or Sister Carrie, as she had been half affectionatelytermed by the family, was possessed of a mind rudimentary in itspower of observation and analysis.  Self-interest with her washigh, but not strong.  It was, nevertheless, her guidingcharacteristic.  Warm with the fancies of youth, pretty with theinsipid prettiness of the formative period, possessed of a figurepromising eventual shapeliness and an eye alight with certainnative intelligence, she was a fair example of the middleAmerican class--two generations removed from the emigrant.  Bookswere beyond her interest--knowledge a sealed book.  In theintuitive graces she was still crude.  She could scarcely tossher head gracefully.  Her hands were almost ineffectual.  Thefeet, though small, were set flatly.  And yet she was interestedin her charms, quick to understand the keener pleasures of life,ambitious to gain in material things.  A half-equipped littleknight she was, venturing to reconnoitre the mysterious city anddreaming wild dreams of some vague, far-off supremacy, whichshould make it prey and subject--the proper penitent, grovellingat a woman's slipper.
　　"That," said a voice in her ear, "is one of the prettiest littleresorts in Wisconsin."
　　"Is it?" she answered nervously.
　　The train was just pulling out of Waukesha.  For some time shehad been conscious of a man behind.  She felt him observing hermass of hair.  He had been fidgetting, and with natural intuitionshe felt a certain interest growing in that quarter.  Hermaidenly reserve, and a certain sense of what was conventionalunder the circumstances, called her to forestall and deny thisfamiliarity, but the daring and magnetism of the individual, bornof past experiences and triumphs, prevailed.  She answered.
　　He leaned forward to put his elbows upon the back of her seat andproceeded to make himself volubly agreeable.
　　"Yes, that is a great resort for Chicago people.  The hotels areswell.  You are not familiar with this part of the country, areyou?"
　　"Oh, yes, I am," answered Carrie.  "That is, I live at ColumbiaCity.  I have never been through here, though."
　　"And so this is your first visit to Chicago," he observed.
　　All the time she was conscious of certain features out of theside of her eye.  Flush, colourful cheeks, a light moustache, agrey fedora hat.  She now turned and looked upon him in full, theinstincts of self-protection and coquetry mingling confusedly inher brain.
　　"I didn't say that," she said.
　　"Oh," he answered, in a very pleasing way and with an assumed airof mistake, "I thought you did."
　　Here was a type of the travelling canvasser for a manufacturinghouse--a class which at that time was first being dubbed by theslang of the day "drummers." He came within the meaning of astill newer term, which had sprung into general use amongAmericans in 1880, and which concisely expressed the thought ofone whose dress or manners are calculated to elicit theadmiration of susceptible young women--a "masher."  His suit wasof a striped and crossed pattern of brown wool, new at that time,but since become familiar as a business suit.  The low crotch ofthe vest revealed a stiff shirt bosom of white and pink stripes.From his coat sleeves protruded a pair of linen cuffs of the samepattern, fastened with large, gold plate buttons, set with thecommon yellow agates known as "cat's-eyes."  His fingers boreseveral rings--one, the ever-enduring heavy seal--and from hisvest dangled a neat gold watch chain, from which was suspendedthe secret insignia of the Order of Elks.  The whole suit wasrather tight-fitting, and was finished off with heavy-soled tanshoes, highly polished, and the grey fedora hat.  He was, for theorder of intellect represented, attractive, and whatever he hadto recommend him, you may be sure was not lost upon Carrie, inthis, her first glance.
　　Lest this order of individual should permanently pass, let me putdown some of the most striking characteristics of his mostsuccessful manner and method.  Good clothes, of course, were thefirst essential, the things without which he was nothing.  Astrong physical nature, actuated by a keen desire for thefeminine, was the next.  A mind free of any consideration of theproblems or forces of the world and actuated not by greed, but aninsatiable love of variable pleasure.  His method was alwayssimple.  Its principal element was daring, backed, of course, byan intense desire and admiration for the sex.  Let him meet witha young woman once and he would approach her with an air ofkindly familiarity, not unmixed with pleading, which would resultin most cases in a tolerant acceptance.  If she showed anytendency to coquetry he would be apt to straighten her tie, or ifshe "took up" with him at all, to call her by her first name.  Ifhe visited a department store it was to lounge familiarly overthe counter and ask some leading questions.  In more exclusivecircles, on the train or in waiting stations, he went slower.  Ifsome seemingly vulnerable object appeared he was all attention--to pass the compliments of the day, to lead the way to the parlorcar, carrying her grip, or, failing that, to take a seat next herwith the hope of being able to court her to her destination.Pillows, books, a footstool, the shade lowered; all these figuredin the things which he could do.  If, when she reached herdestination he did not alight and attend her baggage for her, itwas because, in his own estimation, he had signally failed.
　　A woman should some day write the complete philosophy of clothes.No matter how young, it is one of the things she whollycomprehends.  There is an indescribably faint line in the matterof man's apparel which somehow divides for her those who areworth glancing at and those who are not.  Once an individual haspassed this faint line on the way downward he will get no glancefrom her.  There is another line at which the dress of a man willcause her to study her own. This line the individual at her elbownow marked for Carrie.  She became conscious of an inequality.Her own plain blue dress, with its black cotton tape trimmings,now seemed to her shabby.  She felt the worn state of her shoes.
　　"Let's see," he went on, "I know quite a number of people in yourtown.  Morgenroth the clothier and Gibson the dry goods man."
　　"Oh, do you?" she interrupted, aroused by memories of longingstheir show windows had cost her.
　　At last he had a clew to her interest, and followed it deftly.In a few minutes he had come about into her seat.  He talked ofsales of clothing, his travels, Chicago, and the amusements ofthat city.
　　"If you are going there, you will enjoy it immensely. Have yourelatives?"
　　"I am going to visit my sister," she explained.
　　"You want to see Lincoln Park," he said, "and Michigan Boulevard.They are putting up great buildings there. It's a second NewYork--great.  So much to see--theatres, crowds, fine houses--oh,you'll like that."
　　There was a little ache in her fancy of all he described.  Herinsignificance in the presence of so much magnificence faintlyaffected her.  She realised that hers was not to be a round ofpleasure, and yet there was something promising in all thematerial prospect he set forth.  There was something satisfactoryin the attention of this individual with his good clothes.  Shecould not help smiling as he told her of some popular actress ofwhom she reminded him.  She was not silly, and yet attention ofthis sort had its weight.
　　"You will be in Chicago some little time, won't you?" he observedat one turn of the now easy conversation.
　　"I don't know," said Carrie vaguely--a flash vision of thepossibility of her not securing employment rising in her mind.
　　"Several weeks, anyhow," he said, looking steadily into her eyes.
　　There was much more passing now than the mere words indicated.He recognised the indescribable thing that made up forfascination and beauty in her.  She realised that she was ofinterest to him from the one standpoint which a woman bothdelights in and fears. Her manner was simple, though for the veryreason that she had not yet learned the many little affectationswith which women conceal their true feelings.  Some things shedid appeared bold.  A clever companion--had she ever had one--would have warned her never to look a man in the eyes sosteadily.
　　"Why do you ask?" she said.
　　"Well, I'm going to be there several weeks.  I'm going to studystock at our place and get new samples.  I might show you'round."
　　"I don't know whether you can or not.  I mean I don't knowwhether I can.  I shall be living with my sister, and----"
　　"Well, if she minds, we'll fix that."  He took out his pencil anda little pocket note-book as if it were all settled.  "What isyour address there?"
　　She fumbled her purse which contained the address slip.
　　He reached down in his hip pocket and took out a fat purse.  Itwas filled with slips of paper, some mileage books, a roll ofgreenbacks.  It impressed her deeply. Such a purse had never beencarried by any one attentive to her.  Indeed, an experiencedtraveller, a brisk man of the world, had never come within suchclose range before.  The purse, the shiny tan shoes, the smartnew suit, and the air with which he did things, built up for hera dim world of fortune, of which he was the centre.  It disposedher pleasantly toward all he might do.
　　He took out a neat business card, on which was engraved Bartlett,Caryoe & Company, and down in the left-hand corner, Chas. H.Drouet.
　　"That's me," he said, putting the card in her hand and touchinghis name.  "It's pronounced Drew-eh.  Our family was French, onmy father's side."
　　She looked at it while he put up his purse.  Then he got out aletter from a bunch in his coat pocket. "This is the house Itravel for," he went on, pointing to a picture on it, "corner ofState and Lake."  There was pride in his voice.  He felt that itwas something to be connected with such a place, and he made herfeel that way.
　　"What is your address?" he began again, fixing his pencil towrite.
　　She looked at his hand.
　　"Carrie Meeber," she said slowly.  "Three hundred and fifty-fourWest Van Buren Street, care S. C. Hanson."
　　He wrote it carefully down and got out the purse again. "You'llbe at home if I come around Monday night?" he said.
　　"I think so," she answered.
　　How true it is that words are but the vague shadows of thevolumes we mean.  Little audible links, they are, chainingtogether great inaudible feelings and purposes.  Here were thesetwo, bandying little phrases, drawing purses, looking at cards,and both unconscious of how inarticulate all their real feelingswere.  Neither was wise enough to be sure of the working of themind of the other.  He could not tell how his luring succeeded.She could not realise that she was drifting, until he secured heraddress.  Now she felt that she had yielded something--he, thathe had gained a victory.  Already they felt that they weresomehow associated.  Already he took control in directing theconversation.  His words were easy.  Her manner was relaxed.
　　They were nearing Chicago.  Signs were everywhere numerous.Trains flashed by them.  Across wide stretches of flat, openprairie they could see lines of telegraph poles stalking acrossthe fields toward the great city.  Far away were indications ofsuburban towns, some big smokestacks towering high in the air.
　　Frequently there were two-story frame houses standing out in theopen fields, without fence or trees, lone outposts of theapproaching army of homes.
　　To the child, the genius with imagination, or the whollyuntravelled, the approach to a great city for the first time is awonderful thing.  Particularly if it be evening--that mysticperiod between the glare and gloom of the world when life ischanging from one sphere or condition to another.  Ah, thepromise of the night.  What does it not hold for the weary!  Whatold illusion of hope is not here forever repeated!  Says the soulof the toiler to itself, "I shall soon be free.  I shall be inthe ways and the hosts of the merry.  The streets, the lamps, thelighted chamber set for dining, are for me.  The theatre, thehalls, the parties, the ways of rest and the paths of song--theseare mine in the night."  Though all humanity be still enclosed inthe shops, the thrill runs abroad.  It is in the air.  Thedullest feel something which they may not always express ordescribe.  It is the lifting of the burden of toil.
　　Sister Carrie gazed out of the window.  Her companion, affectedby her wonder, so contagious are all things, felt anew someinterest in the city and pointed out its marvels.
　　"This is Northwest Chicago," said Drouet.  "This is the ChicagoRiver," and he pointed to a little muddy creek, crowded with thehuge masted wanderers from far-off waters nosing the black-postedbanks.  With a puff, a clang, and a clatter of rails it was gone."Chicago is getting to be a great town," he went on.  "It's awonder.  You'll find lots to see here."
　　She did not hear this very well.  Her heart was troubled by akind of terror.  The fact that she was alone, away from home,rushing into a great sea of life and endeavour, began to tell.She could not help but feel a little choked for breath--a littlesick as her heart beat so fast.  She half closed her eyes andtried to think it was nothing, that Columbia City was only alittle way off.
　　"Chicago!  Chicago!" called the brakeman, slamming open the door.They were rushing into a more crowded yard, alive with theclatter and clang of life.  She began to gather up her poorlittle grip and closed her hand firmly upon her purse.  Drouetarose, kicked his legs to straighten his trousers, and seized hisclean yellow grip.
　　"I suppose your people will be here to meet you?" he said.  "Letme carry your grip."
　　"Oh, no," she said.  "I'd rather you wouldn't.  I'd rather youwouldn't be with me when I meet my sister."
　　"All right," he said in all kindness.  "I'll be near, though, incase she isn't here, and take you out there safely."
　　"You're so kind," said Carrie, feeling the goodness of suchattention in her strange situation.
　　"Chicago!" called the brakeman, drawing the word out long.  Theywere under a great shadowy train shed, where the lamps werealready beginning to shine out, with passenger cars all about andthe train moving at a snail's pace.  The people in the car wereall up and crowding about the door.
　　"Well, here we are," said Drouet, leading the way to the door."Good-bye, till I see you Monday."
　　"Good-bye," she answered, taking his proffered hand.
　　"Remember, I'll be looking till you find your sister."
　　She smiled into his eyes.
　　They filed out, and he affected to take no notice of her.  Alean-faced, rather commonplace woman recognised Carrie on theplatform and hurried forward.
　　"Why, Sister Carrie!" she began, and there was embrace ofwelcome.
　　Carrie realised the change of affectional atmosphere at once.Amid all the maze, uproar, and novelty she felt cold realitytaking her by the hand.  No world of light and merriment.  Noround of amusement.  Her sister carried with her most of thegrimness of shift and toil.
　　"Why, how are all the folks at home?" she began; "how is father,and mother?"
　　Carrie answered, but was looking away.  Down the aisle, towardthe gate leading into the waiting-room and the street, stoodDrouet.  He was looking back.  When he saw that she saw him andwas safe with her sister he turned to go, sending back the shadowof a smile.  Only Carrie saw it.  She felt something lost to herwhen he moved away.  When he disappeared she felt his absencethoroughly.  With her sister she was much alone, a lone figure ina tossing, thoughtless sea.
　　Chapter II
　　WHAT POVERTY THREATENED--OF GRANITE AND BRASS
　　Minnie's flat, as the one-floor resident apartments were thenbeing called, was in a part of West Van Buren Street inhabited byfamilies of labourers and clerks, men who had come, and werestill coming, with the rush of population pouring in at the rateof 50,000 a year. It was on the third floor, the front windowslooking down into the street, where, at night, the lights ofgrocery stores were shining and children were playing. To Carrie,the sound of the little bells upon the horse-cars, as theytinkled in and out of hearing, was as pleasing as it was novel.She gazed into the lighted street when Minnie brought her intothe front room, and wondered at the sounds, the movement, themurmur of the vast city which stretched for miles and miles inevery direction.
　　Mrs. Hanson, after the first greetings were over, gave Carrie thebaby and proceeded to get supper.  Her husband asked a fewquestions and sat down to read the evening paper.  He was asilent man, American born, of a Swede father, and now employed asa cleaner of refrigerator cars at the stock-yards.  To him thepresence or absence of his wife's sister was a matter ofindifference.  Her personal appearance did not affect him one wayor the other.  His one observation to the point was concerningthe chances of work in Chicago.
　　"It's a big place," he said.  "You can get in somewhere in a fewdays.  Everybody does."
　　It had been tacitly understood beforehand that she was to getwork and pay her board.  He was of a clean, saving disposition,and had already paid a number of monthly instalments on two lotsfar out on the West Side.  His ambition was some day to build ahouse on them.
　　In the interval which marked the preparation of the meal Carriefound time to study the flat.  She had some slight gift ofobservation and that sense, so rich in every woman--intuition.
　　She felt the drag of a lean and narrow life.  The walls of therooms were discordantly papered.  The floors were covered withmatting and the hall laid with a thin rag carpet.  One could seethat the furniture was of that poor, hurriedly patched togetherquality sold by the instalment houses.
　　She sat with Minnie, in the kitchen, holding the baby until itbegan to cry.  Then she walked and sang to it, until Hanson,disturbed in his reading, came and took it.  A pleasant side tohis nature came out here.  He was patient.  One could see that hewas very much wrapped up in his offspring.
　　"Now, now," he said, walking.  "There, there," and there was acertain Swedish accent noticeable in his voice.
　　"You'll want to see the city first, won't you?" said Minnie, whenthey were eating.  "Well, we'll go out Sunday and see LincolnPark.
　　Carrie noticed that Hanson had said nothing to this. He seemed tobe thinking of something else.
　　"Well," she said, "I think I'll look around tomorrow. I've gotFriday and Saturday, and it won't be any trouble.  Which way isthe business part?"
　　Minnie began to explain, but her husband took this part of theconversation to himself.
　　"It's that way," he said, pointing east.  "That's east."  Then hewent off into the longest speech he had yet indulged in,concerning the lay of Chicago.  "You'd better look in those bigmanufacturing houses along Franklin Street and just the otherside of the river," he concluded.  "Lots of girls work there.You could get home easy, too.  It isn't very far."
　　Carrie nodded and asked her sister about the neighbourhood.  Thelatter talked in a subdued tone, telling the little she knewabout it, while Hanson concerned himself with the baby.  Finallyhe jumped up and handed the child to his wife.
　　"I've got to get up early in the morning, so I'll go to bed," andoff he went, disappearing into the dark little bedroom off thehall, for the night.
　　"He works way down at the stock-yards," explained Minnie, "sohe's got to get up at half-past five."
　　"What time do you get up to get breakfast?" asked Carrie.
　　"At about twenty minutes of five."
　　Together they finished the labour of the day, Carrie washing thedishes while Minnie undressed the baby and put it to bed.Minnie's manner was one of trained industry, and Carrie could seethat it was a steady round of toil with her.
　　She began to see that her relations with Drouet would have to beabandoned.  He could not come here.  She read from the manner ofHanson, in the subdued air of Minnie, and, indeed, the wholeatmosphere of the flat, a settled opposition to anything save aconservative round of toil.  If Hanson sat every evening in thefront room and read his paper, if he went to bed at nine, andMinnie a little later, what would they expect of her?  She sawthat she would first need to get work and establish herself on apaying basis before she could think of having company of anysort.  Her little flirtation with Drouet seemed now anextraordinary thing.
　　"No," she said to herself, "he can't come here."
　　She asked Minnie for ink and paper, which were upon the mantel inthe dining-room, and when the latter had gone to bed at ten, gotout Drouet's card and wrote him.
　　"I cannot have you call on me here.  You will have to wait untilyou hear from me again.  My sister's place is so small."
　　She troubled herself over what else to put in the letter.  Shewanted to make some reference to their relations upon the train,but was too timid.  She concluded by thanking him for hiskindness in a crude way, then puzzled over the formality ofsigning her name, and finally decided upon the severe, winding upwith a "Very truly," which she subsequently changed to"Sincerely."  She scaled and addressed the letter, and going inthe front room, the alcove of which contained her bed, drew theone small rocking-chair up to the open window, and sat lookingout upon the night and streets in silent wonder.  Finally,wearied by her own reflections, she began to grow dull in herchair, and feeling the need of sleep, arranged her clothing forthe night and went to bed.
　　When she awoke at eight the next morning, Hanson had gone.  Hersister was busy in the dining-room, which was also the sitting-room, sewing.  She worked, after dressing, to arrange a littlebreakfast for herself, and then advised with Minnie as to whichway to look. The latter had changed considerably since Carrie hadseen her.  She was now a thin, though rugged, woman of twenty-seven, with ideas of life coloured by her husband's, and fasthardening into narrower conceptions of pleasure and duty than hadever been hers in a thoroughly circumscribed youth.  She hadinvited Carrie, not because she longed for her presence, butbecause the latter was dissatisfied at home, and could probablyget work and pay her board here.  She was pleased to see her in away but reflected her husband's point of view in the matter ofwork.  Anything was good enough so long as it paid--say, fivedollars a week to begin with.  A shop girl was the destinyprefigured for the newcomer.  She would get in one of the greatshops and do well enough until--well, until something happened.Neither of them knew exactly what.  They did not figure onpromotion.  They did not exactly count on marriage.  Things wouldgo on, though, in a dim kind of way until the better thing wouldeventuate, and Carrie would be rewarded for coming and toiling inthe city. It was under such auspicious circumstances that shestarted out this morning to look for work.
　　Before following her in her round of seeking, let us look at thesphere in which her future was to lie.  In 1889 Chicago had thepeculiar qualifications of growth which made such adventuresomepilgrimages even on the part of young girls plausible.  Its manyand growing commercial opportunities gave it widespread fame,which made of it a giant magnet, drawing to itself, from allquarters, the hopeful and the hopeless--those who had theirfortune yet to make and those whose fortunes and affairs hadreached a disastrous climax elsewhere.  It was a city of over500,000, with the ambition, the daring, the activity of ametropolis of a million.  Its streets and houses were alreadyscattered over an area of seventy-five square miles.  Itspopulation was not so much thriving upon established commerce asupon the industries which prepared for the arrival of others. Thesound of the hammer engaged upon the erection of new structureswas everywhere heard.  Great industries were moving in.  The hugerailroad corporations which had long before recognised theprospects of the place had seized upon vast tracts of land fortransfer and shipping purposes.  Street-car lines had beenextended far out into the open country in anticipation of rapidgrowth.  The city had laid miles and miles of streets and sewersthrough regions where, perhaps, one solitary house stood outalone--a pioneer of the populous ways to be.  There were regionsopen to the sweeping winds and rain, which were yet lightedthroughout the night with long, blinking lines of gas-lamps,fluttering in the wind.  Narrow board walks extended out, passinghere a house, and there a store, at far intervals, eventuallyending on the open prairie.
　　In the central portion was the vast wholesale and shoppingdistrict, to which the uninformed seeker for work usuallydrifted.  It was a characteristic of Chicago then, and one notgenerally shared by other cities, that individual firms of anypretension occupied individual buildings.  The presence of ampleground made this possible.  It gave an imposing appearance tomost of the wholesale houses, whose offices were upon the groundfloor and in plain view of the street.  The large plates ofwindow glass, now so common, were then rapidly coming into use,and gave to the ground floor offices a distinguished andprosperous look.  The casual wanderer could see as he passed apolished array of office fixtures, much frosted glass, clerkshard at work, and genteel businessmen in "nobby" suits and cleanlinen lounging about or sitting in groups.  Polished brass ornickel signs at the square stone entrances announced the firm andthe nature of the business in rather neat and reserved terms.The entire metropolitan centre possessed a high and mighty aircalculated to overawe and abash the common applicant, and to makethe gulf between poverty and success seem both wide and deep.
　　Into this important commercial region the timid Carrie went.  Shewalked east along Van Buren Street through a region of lesseningimportance, until it deteriorated into a mass of shanties andcoal-yards, and finally verged upon the river.  She walkedbravely forward, led by an honest desire to find employment anddelayed at every step by the interest of the unfolding scene, anda sense of helplessness amid so much evidence of power and forcewhich she did not understand.  These vast buildings, what werethey?  These strange energies and huge interests, for whatpurposes were they there?  She could have understood the meaningof a little stone-cutter's yard at Columbia City, carving littlepieces of marble for individual use, but when the yards of somehuge stone corporation came into view, filled with spur tracksand flat cars, transpierced by docks from the river and traversedoverhead by immense trundling cranes of wood and steel, it lostall significance in her little world.
　　It was so with the vast railroad yards, with the crowded array ofvessels she saw at the river, and the huge factories over theway, lining the water's edge. Through the open windows she couldsee the figures of men and women in working aprons, moving busilyabout. The great streets were wall-lined mysteries to her; thevast offices, strange mazes which concerned far-off individualsof importance.  She could only think of people connected withthem as counting money, dressing magnificently, and riding incarriages.  What they dealt in, how they laboured, to what end itall came, she had only the vaguest conception.  It was allwonderful, all vast, all far removed, and she sank in spiritinwardly and fluttered feebly at the heart as she thought ofentering any one of these mighty concerns and asking forsomething to do--something that she could do--anything.
　　Chapter III
　　WEE QUESTION OF FORTUNE--FOUR-FIFTY A WEEK
　　Once across the river and into the wholesale district, sheglanced about her for some likely door at which to apply.  As shecontemplated the wide windows and imposing signs, she becameconscious of being gazed upon and understood for what she was--awage-seeker. She had never done this thing before, and lackedcourage.   To avoid a certain indefinable shame she felt at beingcaught spying about for a position, she quickened her steps andassumed an air of indifference supposedly common to one upon anerrand.  In this way she passed many manufacturing and wholesalehouses without once glancing in.  At last, after several blocksof walking, she felt that this would not do, and began to lookabout again, though without relaxing her pace.  A little way onshe saw a great door which, for some reason, attracted herattention.  It was ornamented by a small brass sign, and seemedto be the entrance to a vast hive of six or seven floors."Perhaps," she thought, "they may want some one," and crossedover to enter.  When she came within a score of feet of thedesired goal, she saw through the window a young man in a greychecked suit.  That he had anything to do with the concern, shecould not tell, but because he happened to be looking in herdirection her weakening heart misgave her and she hurried by, tooovercome with shame to enter.  Over the way stood a great six-story structure, labelled Storm and King, which she viewed withrising hope.  It was a wholesale dry goods concern and employedwomen.  She could see them moving about now and then upon theupper floors. This place she decided to enter, no matter what.She crossed over and walked directly toward the entrance. As shedid so, two men came out and paused in the door. A telegraphmessenger in blue dashed past her and up the few steps that ledto the entrance and disappeared. Several pedestrians out of thehurrying throng which filled the sidewalks passed about her asshe paused, hesitating.  She looked helplessly around, and then,seeing herself observed, retreated.  It was too difficult a task.She could not go past them.
　　So severe a defeat told sadly upon her nerves.  Her feet carriedher mechanically forward, every foot of her progress being asatisfactory portion of a flight which she gladly made.  Blockafter block passed by. Upon streetlamps at the various cornersshe read names such as Madison, Monroe, La Salle, Clark,Dearborn, State, and still she went, her feet beginning to tireupon the broad stone flagging.  She was pleased in part that thestreets were bright and clean.  The morning sun, shining downwith steadily increasing warmth, made the shady side of thestreets pleasantly cool. She looked at the blue sky overhead withmore realisation of its charm than had ever come to her before.
　　Her cowardice began to trouble her in a way.  She turned back,resolving to hunt up Storm and King and enter.  On the way, sheencountered a great wholesale shoe company, through the broadplate windows of which she saw an enclosed executive department,hidden by frosted glass.  Without this enclosure, but just withinthe street entrance, sat a grey-haired gentleman at a smalltable, with a large open ledger before him.  She walked by thisinstitution several times hesitating, but, finding herselfunobserved, faltered past the screen door and stood humblewaiting.
　　"Well, young lady," observed the old gentleman, looking at hersomewhat kindly, "what is it you wish?"
　　"I am, that is, do you--I mean, do you need any help?" shestammered.
　　"Not just at present," he answered smiling.  "Not just atpresent.  Come in some time next week.  Occasionally we need someone."
　　She received the answer in silence and backed awkwardly out.  Thepleasant nature of her reception rather astonished her.  She hadexpected that it would be more difficult, that something cold andharsh would be said--she knew not what.  That she had not beenput to shame and made to feel her unfortunate position, seemedremarkable.
　　Somewhat encouraged, she ventured into another large structure.It was a clothing company, and more people were in evidence--well-dressed men of forty and more, surrounded by brass railings.
　　An office boy approached her.
　　"Who is it you wish to see?" he asked.
　　"I want to see the manager," she said.He ran away and spoke to one of a group of three men who wereconferring together.  One of these came towards her.
　　"Well?" he said coldly.  The greeting drove all courage from herat once.
　　"Do you need any help?" she stammered.
　　"No," he replied abruptly, and turned upon his heel.
　　She went foolishly out, the office boy deferentially swinging thedoor for her, and gladly sank into the obscuring crowd.  It was asevere setback to her recently pleased mental state.
　　Now she walked quite aimlessly for a time, turning here andthere, seeing one great company after another, but finding nocourage to prosecute her single inquiry. High noon came, and withit hunger.  She hunted out an unassuming restaurant and entered,but was disturbed to find that the prices were exorbitant for thesize of her purse.  A bowl of soup was all that she could afford,and, with this quickly eaten, she went out again.  It restoredher strength somewhat and made her moderately bold to pursue thesearch.
　　In walking a few blocks to fix upon some probable place, sheagain encountered the firm of Storm and King, and this timemanaged to get in.  Some gentlemen were conferring close at hand,but took no notice of her.  She was left standing, gazingnervously upon the floor.  When the limit of her distress hadbeen nearly reached, she was beckoned to by a man at one of themany desks within the near-by railing.
　　"Who is it you wish to see?" he required.
　　"Why, any one, if you please," she answered.  "I am looking forsomething to do."
　　"Oh, you want to see Mr. McManus," he returned.  "Sit down," andhe pointed to a chair against the neighbouring wall.  He went onleisurely writing, until after a time a short, stout gentlemancame in from the street.
　　"Mr. McManus," called the man at the desk, "this young womanwants to see you."
　　The short gentleman turned about towards Carrie, and she aroseand came forward.
　　"What can I do for you, miss?" he inquired, surveying hercuriously.
　　"I want to know if I can get a position," she inquired.
　　"As what?" he asked.
　　"Not as anything in particular," she faltered.
　　"Have you ever had any experience in the wholesale dry goodsbusiness?" he questioned.
　　"No, sir," she replied.
　　"Are you a stenographer or typewriter?"
　　"No, sir.""Well, we haven't anything here," he said.  "We employ onlyexperienced help."
　　She began to step backward toward the door, when something abouther plaintive face attracted him.
　　"Have you ever worked at anything before?" he inquired.
　　"No, sir," she said.
　　"Well, now, it's hardly possible that you would get anything todo in a wholesale house of this kind.  Have you tried thedepartment stores?"
　　She acknowledged that she had not.
　　"Well, if I were you," he said, looking at her rather genially,"I would try the department stores.  They often need young womenas clerks."
　　"Thank you," she said, her whole nature relieved by this spark offriendly interest.
　　"Yes," he said, as she moved toward the door, "you try thedepartment stores," and off he went.
　　At that time the department store was in its earliest form ofsuccessful operation, and there were not many. The first three inthe United States, established about 1884, were in Chicago.Carrie was familiar with the names of several through theadvertisements in the "Daily News," and now proceeded to seekthem.  The words of Mr. McManus had somehow managed to restoreher courage, which had fallen low, and she dared to hope thatthis new line would offer her something.  Some time she spent inwandering up and down, thinking to encounter the buildings bychance, so readily is the mind, bent upon prosecuting a hard butneedful errand, eased by that self-deception which the semblanceof search, without the reality, gives.  At last she inquired of apolice officer, and was directed to proceed "two blocks up,"where she would find "The Fair."
　　The nature of these vast retail combinations, should they everpermanently disappear, will form an interesting chapter in thecommercial history of our nation.  Such a flowering out of amodest trade principle the world had never witnessed up to thattime.  They were along the line of the most effective retailorganisation, with hundreds of stores coordinated into one andlaid out upon the most imposing and economic basis.  They werehandsome, bustling, successful affairs, with a host of clerks anda swarm of patrons.  Carrie passed along the busy aisles, muchaffected by the remarkable displays of trinkets, dress goods,stationery, and jewelry.  Each separate counter was a show placeof dazzling interest and attraction.  She could not help feelingthe claim of each trinket and valuable upon her personally, andyet she did not stop.  There was nothing there which she couldnot have used--nothing which she did not long to own.  The daintyslippers and stockings, the delicately frilled skirts andpetticoats, the laces, ribbons, hair-combs, purses, all touchedher with individual desire, and she felt keenly the fact that notany of these things were in the range of her purchase.  She was awork-seeker, an outcast without employment, one whom the averageemployee could tell at a glance was poor and in need of asituation.
　　It must not be thought that any one could have mistaken her for anervous, sensitive, high-strung nature, cast unduly upon a cold,calculating, and unpoetic world. Such certainly she was not.  Butwomen are peculiarly sensitive to their adornment.
　　Not only did Carrie feel the drag of desire for all which was newand pleasing in apparel for women, but she noticed too, with atouch at the heart, the fine ladies who elbowed and ignored her,brushing past in utter disregard of her presence, themselveseagerly enlisted in the materials which the store contained.Carrie was not familiar with the appearance of her more fortunatesisters of the city.  Neither had she before known the nature andappearance of the shop girls with whom she now compared poorly.They were pretty in the main, some even handsome, with an air ofindependence and indifference which added, in the case of themore favoured, a certain piquancy.  Their clothes were neat, inmany instances fine, and wherever she encountered the eye of oneit was only to recognise in it a keen analysis of her ownposition--her individual shortcomings of dress and that shadow ofmanner which she thought must hang about her and make clear toall who and what she was.  A flame of envy lighted in her heart.She realised in a dim way how much the city held--wealth,fashion, ease--every adornment for women, and she longed fordress and beauty with a whole heart.
　　On the second floor were the managerial offices, to which, aftersome inquiry, she was now directed. There she found other girlsahead of her, applicants like herself, but with more of thatself-satisfied and independent air which experience of the citylends; girls who scrutinised her in a painful manner.  After await of perhaps three-quarters of an hour, she was called inturn.
　　"Now," said a sharp, quick-mannered Jew, who was sitting at aroll-top desk near the window, "have you ever worked in any otherstore?"
　　"No, sir," said Carrie.
　　"Oh, you haven't," he said, eyeing her keenly.
　　"No, sir," she replied.
　　"Well, we prefer young women just now with some experience.  Iguess we can't use you."
　　Carrie stood waiting a moment, hardly certain whether theinterview had terminated.
　　"Don't wait!" he exclaimed.  "Remember we are very busy here."
　　Carrie began to move quickly to the door.
　　"Hold on," he said, calling her back.  "Give me your name andaddress.  We want girls occasionally."
　　When she had gotten safely into the street, she could scarcelyrestrain the tears.  It was not so much the particular rebuffwhich she had just experienced, but the whole abashing trend ofthe day.  She was tired and nervous.  She abandoned the thoughtof appealing to the other department stores and now wandered on,feeling a certain safety and relief in mingling with the crowd.
　　In her indifferent wandering she turned into Jackson Street, notfar from the river, and was keeping her way along the south sideof that imposing thoroughfare, when a piece of wrapping paper,written on with marking ink and tacked up on the door, attractedher attention. It read, "Girls wanted--wrappers & stitchers."She hesitated a moment, then entered.
　　The firm of Speigelheim & Co., makers of boys' caps, occupied onefloor of the building, fifty feet in width and some eighty feetin depth.  It was a place rather dingily lighted, the darkestportions having incandescent lights, filled with machines andwork benches.  At the latter laboured quite a company of girlsand some men.  The former were drabby-looking creatures, stainedin face with oil and dust, clad in thin, shapeless, cottondresses and shod with more or less worn shoes.  Many of them hadtheir sleeves rolled up, revealing bare arms, and in some cases,owing to the heat, their dresses were open at the neck.  Theywere a fair type of nearly the lowest order of shop-girls--careless, slouchy, and more or less pale from confinement.  Theywere not timid, however; were rich in curiosity, and strong indaring and slang.
　　Carrie looked about her, very much disturbed and quite sure thatshe did not want to work here.  Aside from making heruncomfortable by sidelong glances, no one paid her the leastattention.  She waited until the whole department was aware ofher presence.  Then some word was sent around, and a foreman, inan apron and shirt sleeves, the latter rolled up to hisshoulders, approached.
　　"Do you want to see me?" he asked.
　　"Do you need any help?" said Carrie, already learning directnessof address.
　　"Do you know how to stitch caps?" he returned.
　　"No, sir," she replied.
　　"Have you ever had any experience at this kind of work?" heinquired.
　　She answered that she had not.
　　"Well," said the foreman, scratching his ear meditatively, "we doneed a stitcher.  We like experienced help, though.  We've hardlygot time to break people in."  He paused and looked away out ofthe window.  "We might, though, put you at finishing," heconcluded reflectively.
　　"How much do you pay a week?" ventured Carrie, emboldened by acertain softness in the man's manner and his simplicity ofaddress.
　　"Three and a half," he answered.
　　"Oh," she was about to exclaim, but checked herself and allowedher thoughts to die without expression.
　　"We're not exactly in need of anybody," he went on vaguely,looking her over as one would a package.  "You can come on Mondaymorning, though," he added, "and I'll put you to work."
　　"Thank you," said Carrie weakly.
　　"If you come, bring an apron," he added.
　　He walked away and left her standing by the elevator, never somuch as inquiring her name.
　　While the appearance of the shop and the announcement of theprice paid per week operated very much as a blow to Carrie'sfancy, the fact that work of any kind was offered after so rude around of experience was gratifying.  She could not begin tobelieve that she would take the place, modest as her aspirationswere. She had been used to better than that.  Her mere experienceand the free out-of-door life of the country caused her nature torevolt at such confinement.  Dirt had never been her share.  Hersister's flat was clean. This place was grimy and low, the girlswere careless and hardened.  They must be bad-minded and hearted,she imagined.  Still, a place had been offered her.  SurelyChicago was not so bad if she could find one place in one day.She might find another and better later.
　　Her subsequent experiences were not of a reassuring nature,however.  From all the more pleasing or imposing places she wasturned away abruptly with the most chilling formality.  In otherswhere she applied only the experienced were required.  She metwith painful rebuffs, the most trying of which had been in amanufacturing cloak house, where she had gone to the fourth floorto inquire.
　　"No, no," said the foreman, a rough, heavily built individual,who looked after a miserably lighted workshop, "we don't want anyone.  Don't come here."
　　With the wane of the afternoon went her hopes, her courage, andher strength.  She had been astonishingly persistent.  So earnestan effort was well deserving of a better reward.  On every hand,to her fatigued senses, the great business portion grew larger,harder, more stolid in its indifference.  It seemed as if it wasall closed to her, that the struggle was too fierce for her tohope to do anything at all.  Men and women hurried by in long,shifting lines.  She felt the flow of the tide of effort andinterest--felt her own helplessness without quite realising thewisp on the tide that she was.  She cast about vainly for somepossible place to apply, but found no door which she had thecourage to enter.  It would be the same thing all over.  The oldhumiliation of her plea, rewarded by curt denial.  Sick at heartand in body, she turned to the west, the direction of Minnie'sflat, which she had now fixed in mind, and began that wearisome,baffled retreat which the seeker for employment at nightfall toooften makes.  In passing through Fifth Avenue, south towards VanBuren Street, where she intended to take a car, she passed thedoor of a large wholesale shoe house, through the plate-glasswindows of which she could see a middle-aged gentleman sitting ata small desk.  One of those forlorn impulses which often grow outof a fixed sense of defeat, the last sprouting of a baffled anduprooted growth of ideas, seized upon her.  She walkeddeliberately through the door and up to the gentleman, who lookedat her weary face with partially awakened interest.
　　"What is it?" he said.
　　"Can you give me something to do?" said Carrie.
　　"Now, I really don't know," he said kindly.  "What kind of workis it you want--you're not a typewriter, are you?"
　　"Oh, no," answered Carrie.
　　"Well, we only employ book-keepers and typewriters here.  Youmight go around to the side and inquire upstairs.  They did wantsome help upstairs a few days ago.  Ask for Mr. Brown."
　　She hastened around to the side entrance and was taken up by theelevator to the fourth floor.
　　"Call Mr. Brown, Willie," said the elevator man to a boy near by.
　　Willie went off and presently returned with the information thatMr. Brown said she should sit down and that he would be around ina little while.
　　It was a portion of the stock room which gave no idea of thegeneral character of the place, and Carrie could form no opinionof the nature of the work.
　　"So you want something to do," said Mr. Brown, after he inquiredconcerning the nature of her errand.  "Have you ever beenemployed in a shoe factory before?"
　　"No, sir," said Carrie.
　　"What is your name?" he inquired, and being informed, "Well, Idon't know as I have anything for you.  Would you work for fourand a half a week?"
　　Carrie was too worn by defeat not to feel that it wasconsiderable.  She had not expected that he would offer her lessthan six.  She acquiesced, however, and he took her name andaddress.
　　"Well," he said, finally, "you report here at eight o'clockMonday morning.  I think I can find something for you to do."
　　He left her revived by the possibilities, sure that she had foundsomething at last.  Instantly the blood crept warmly over herbody.  Her nervous tension relaxed. She walked out into the busystreet and discovered a new atmosphere.  Behold, the throng wasmoving with a lightsome step.  She noticed that men and womenwere smiling.  Scraps of conversation and notes of laughterfloated to her.  The air was light.  People were already pouringout of the buildings, their labour ended for the day.  Shenoticed that they were pleased, and thoughts of her sister's homeand the meal that would be awaiting her quickened her steps.  Shehurried on, tired perhaps, but no longer weary of foot.  Whatwould not Minnie say!  Ah, the long winter in Chicago--thelights, the crowd, the amusement!  This was a great, pleasingmetropolis after all.  Her new firm was a goodly institution.Its windows were of huge plate glass.  She could probably do wellthere.  Thoughts of Drouet returned--of the things he had toldher.  She now felt that life was better, that it was livelier,sprightlier.  She boarded a car in the best of spirits, feelingher blood still flowing pleasantly.  She would live in Chicago,her mind kept saying to itself.  She would have a better timethan she had ever had before--she would be happy.
　　Chapter IV
　　THE SPENDINGS OF FANCY--FACTS ANSWER WITH SNEERS
　　For the next two days Carrie indulged in the most high-flownspeculations.
　　Her fancy plunged recklessly into privileges and amusements whichwould have been much more becoming had she been cradled a childof fortune.  With ready will and quick mental selection shescattered her meagre four-fifty per week with a swift andgraceful hand. Indeed, as she sat in her rocking-chair theseseveral evenings before going to bed and looked out upon thepleasantly lighted street, this money cleared for its prospectivepossessor the way to every joy and every bauble which the heartof woman may desire.  "I will have a fine time," she thought.
　　Her sister Minnie knew nothing of these rather wild cerebrations,though they exhausted the markets of delight.  She was too busyscrubbing the kitchen woodwork and calculating the purchasingpower of eighty cents for Sunday's dinner.  When Carrie hadreturned home, flushed with her first success and ready, for allher weariness, to discuss the now interesting events which led upto her achievement, the former had merely smiled approvingly andinquired whether she would have to spend any of it for car fare.This consideration had not entered in before, and it did not nowfor long affect the glow of Carrie's enthusiasm.  Disposed as shethen was to calculate upon that vague basis which allows thesubtraction of one sum from another without any perceptiblediminution, she was happy.
　　When Hanson came home at seven o'clock, he was inclined to be alittle crusty--his usual demeanour before supper.  This nevershowed so much in anything he said as in a certain solemnity ofcountenance and the silent manner in which he slopped about.  Hehad a pair of yellow carpet slippers which he enjoyed wearing,and these he would immediately substitute for his solid pair ofshoes.  This, and washing his face with the aid of common washingsoap until it glowed a shiny red, constituted his onlypreparation for his evening meal. He would then get his eveningpaper and read in silence.
　　For a young man, this was rather a morbid turn of character, andso affected Carrie.  Indeed, it affected the entire atmosphere ofthe flat, as such things are inclined to do, and gave to hiswife's mind its subdued and tactful turn, anxious to avoidtaciturn replies. Under the influence of Carrie's announcement hebrightened up somewhat.
　　"You didn't lose any time, did you?" he remarked, smiling alittle.
　　"No," returned Carrie with a touch of pride.
　　He asked her one or two more questions and then turned to playwith the baby, leaving the subject until it was brought up againby Minnie at the table.
　　Carrie, however, was not to be reduced to the common level ofobservation which prevailed in the flat.
　　"It seems to be such a large company," she said, at one place.
　　"Great big plate-glass windows and lots of clerks.  The man I sawsaid they hired ever so many people."
　　"It's not very hard to get work now," put in Hanson, "if you lookright."
　　Minnie, under the warming influence of Carrie's good spirits andher husband's somewhat conversational mood, began to tell Carrieof some of the well-known things to see--things the enjoyment ofwhich cost nothing.
　　"You'd like to see Michigan Avenue.  There are such fine houses.It is such a fine street."
　　"Where is H. R. Jacob's?" interrupted Carrie, mentioning one ofthe theatres devoted to melodrama which went by that name at thetime.
　　"Oh, it's not very far from here," answered Minnie. "It's inHalstead Street, right up here."
　　"How I'd like to go there.  I crossed Halstead Street to-day,didn't I?"
　　At this there was a slight halt in the natural reply. Thoughtsare a strangely permeating factor.  At her suggestion of going tothe theatre, the unspoken shade of disapproval to the doing ofthose things which involved the expenditure of money--shades offeeling which arose in the mind of Hanson and then in Minnie--slightly affected the atmosphere of the table.  Minnie answered"yes," but Carrie could feel that going to the theatre was poorlyadvocated here.  The subject was put off for a little while untilHanson, through with his meal, took his paper and went into thefront room.
　　When they were alone, the two sisters began a somewhat freerconversation, Carrie interrupting it to hum a little, as theyworked at the dishes.
　　"I should like to walk up and see Halstead Street, if it isn'ttoo far," said Carrie, after a time.  "Why don't we go to thetheatre to-night?"
　　"Oh, I don't think Sven would want to go to-night," returnedMinnie.  "He has to get up so early."
　　"He wouldn't mind--he'd enjoy it," said Carrie.
　　"No, he doesn't go very often," returned Minnie.
　　"Well, I'd like to go," rejoined Carrie.  "Let's you and me go."
　　Minnie pondered a while, not upon whether she could or would go--for that point was already negatively settled with her--but uponsome means of diverting the thoughts of her sister to some othertopic.
　　"We'll go some other time," she said at last, finding no readymeans of escape.
　　Carrie sensed the root of the opposition at once.
　　"I have some money," she said.  "You go with me." Minnie shookher head.
　　"He could go along," said Carrie.
　　"No," returned Minnie softly, and rattling the dishes to drownthe conversation.  "He wouldn't."
　　It had been several years since Minnie had seen Carrie, and inthat time the latter's character had developed a few shades.Naturally timid in all things that related to her ownadvancement, and especially so when without power or resource,her craving for pleasure was so strong that it was the one stayof her nature.  She would speak for that when silent on all else.
　　"Ask him," she pleaded softly.
　　Minnie was thinking of the resource which Carrie's board wouldadd.  It would pay the rent and would make the subject ofexpenditure a little less difficult to talk about with herhusband.  But if Carrie was going to think of running around inthe beginning there would be a hitch somewhere.  Unless Carriesubmitted to a solemn round of industry and saw the need of hardwork without longing for play, how was her coming to the city toprofit them?  These thoughts were not those of a cold, hardnature at all.  They were the serious reflections of a mind whichinvariably adjusted itself, without much complaining, to suchsurroundings as its industry could make for it.
　　At last she yielded enough to ask Hanson.  It was a half-heartedprocedure without a shade of desire on her part.
　　"Carrie wants us to go to the theatre," she said, looking in uponher husband.  Hanson looked up from his paper, and they exchangeda mild look, which said as plainly as anything: "This isn't whatwe expected."
　　"I don't care to go," he returned.  "What does she want to see?"
　　"H. R. Jacob's," said Minnie.
　　He looked down at his paper and shook his head negatively.
　　When Carrie saw how they looked upon her proposition, she gaineda still clearer feeling of their way of life.  It weighed on her,but took no definite form of opposition.
　　"I think I'll go down and stand at the foot of the stairs," shesaid, after a time.
　　Minnie made no objection to this, and Carrie put on her hat andwent below.
　　"Where has Carrie gone?" asked Hanson, coming back into thedining-room when he heard the door close.
　　"She said she was going down to the foot of the stairs," answeredMinnie.  "I guess she just wants to look out a while."
　　"She oughtn't to be thinking about spending her money on theatresalready, do you think?" he said.
　　"She just feels a little curious, I guess," ventured Minnie."Everything is so new."
　　"I don't know," said Hanson, and went over to the baby, hisforehead slightly wrinkled.
　　He was thinking of a full career of vanity and wastefulness whicha young girl might indulge in, and wondering how Carrie couldcontemplate such a course when she had so little, as yet, withwhich to do.
　　On Saturday Carrie went out by herself--first toward the river,which interested her, and then back along Jackson Street, whichwas then lined by the pretty houses and fine lawns whichsubsequently caused it to be made into a boulevard.  She wasstruck with the evidences of wealth, although there was, perhaps,not a person on the street worth more than a hundred thousanddollars.  She was glad to be out of the flat, because already shefelt that it was a narrow, humdrum place, and that interest andjoy lay elsewhere.  Her thoughts now were of a more liberalcharacter, and she punctuated them with speculations as to thewhereabouts of Drouet.  She was not sure but that he might callanyhow Monday night, and, while she felt a little disturbed atthe possibility, there was, nevertheless, just the shade of awish that he would.
　　On Monday she arose early and prepared to go to work. She dressedherself in a worn shirt-waist of dotted blue percale, a skirt oflight-brown serge rather faded, and a small straw hat which shehad worn all summer at Columbia City.  Her shoes were old, andher necktie was in that crumpled, flattened state which time andmuch wearing impart.  She made a very average looking shop-girlwith the exception of her features. These were slightly more eventhan common, and gave her a sweet, reserved, and pleasingappearance.
　　It is no easy thing to get up early in the morning when one isused to sleeping until seven and eight, as Carrie had been athome.  She gained some inkling of the character of Hanson's lifewhen, half asleep, she looked out into the dining-room at sixo'clock and saw him silently finishing his breakfast.  By thetime she was dressed he was gone, and she, Minnie, and the babyate together, the latter being just old enough to sit in a highchair and disturb the dishes with a spoon. Her spirits weregreatly subdued now when the fact of entering upon strange anduntried duties confronted her.  Only the ashes of all her finefancies were remaining--ashes still concealing, nevertheless, afew red embers of hope.  So subdued was she by her weakeningnerves, that she ate quite in silence going over imaginaryconceptions of the character of the shoe company, the nature ofthe work, her employer's attitude.  She was vaguely feeling thatshe would come in contact with the great owners, that her workwould be where grave, stylishly dressed men occasionally look on.
　　"Well, good luck," said Minnie, when she was ready to go.  Theyhad agreed it was best to walk, that morning at least, to see ifshe could do it every day--sixty cents a week for car fare beingquite an item under the circumstances.
　　"I'll tell you how it goes to-night," said Carrie.
　　Once in the sunlit street, with labourers tramping by in eitherdirection, the horse-cars passing crowded to the rails with thesmall clerks and floor help in the great wholesale houses, andmen and women generally coming out of doors and passing about theneighbourhood, Carrie felt slightly reassured.  In the sunshineof the morning, beneath the wide, blue heavens, with a fresh windastir, what fears, except the most desperate, can find aharbourage?  In the night, or the gloomy chambers of the day,fears and misgivings wax strong, but out in the sunlight thereis, for a time, cessation even of the terror of death.
　　Carrie went straight forward until she crossed the river, andthen turned into Fifth Avenue.  The thoroughfare, in this part,was like a walled canon of brown stone and dark red brick.  Thebig windows looked shiny and clean.  Trucks were rumbling inincreasing numbers; men and women, girls and boys were movingonward in all directions.  She met girls of her own age, wholooked at her as if with contempt for her diffidence.  Shewondered at the magnitude of this life and at the importance ofknowing much in order to do anything in it at all.  Dread at herown inefficiency crept upon her.  She would not know how, shewould not be quick enough.  Had not all the other places refusedher because she did not know something or other?  She would bescolded, abused, ignominiously discharged.
　　It was with weak knees and a slight catch in her breathing thatshe came up to the great shoe company at Adams and Fifth Avenueand entered the elevator.  When she stepped out on the fourthfloor there was no one at hand, only great aisles of boxes piledto the ceiling. She stood, very much frightened, awaiting someone.
　　Presently Mr. Brown came up.  He did not seem to recosnise her.
　　"What is it you want?" he inquired.
　　Carrie's heart sank.
　　"You said I should come this morning to see about work--"
　　"Oh," he interrupted.  "Um--yes.  What is your name?"
　　"Carrie Meeber."
　　"Yes," said he.  "You come with me."
　　He led the way through dark, box-lined aisles which had the smellof new shoes, until they came to an iron door which opened intothe factory proper.  There was a large, low-ceiled room, withclacking, rattling machines at which men in white shirt sleevesand blue gingham aprons were working.  She followed himdiffidently through the clattering automatons, keeping her eyesstraight before her, and flushing slightly. They crossed to a farcorner and took an elevator to the sixth floor.  Out of the arrayof machines and benches, Mr. Brown signalled a foreman.
　　"This is the girl," he said, and turning to Carrie, "You go withhim."  He then returned, and Carrie followed her new superior toa little desk in a corner, which he used as a kind of officialcentre.
　　"You've never worked at anything like this before, have you?" hequestioned, rather sternly.
　　"No, sir," she answered.
　　He seemed rather annoyed at having to bother with such help, butput down her name and then led her across to where a line ofgirls occupied stools in front of clacking machines.  On theshoulder of one of the girls who was punching eye-holes in onepiece of the upper, by the aid of the machine, he put his hand.
　　"You," he said, "show this girl how to do what you're doing.When you get through, come to me."
　　The girl so addressed rose promptly and gave Carrie her place.
　　"It isn't hard to do," she said, bending over.  "You just takethis so, fasten it with this clamp, and start the machine."
　　She suited action to word, fastened the piece of leather, whichwas eventually to form the right half of the upper of a man'sshoe, by little adjustable clamps, and pushed a small steel rodat the side of the machine.  The latter jumped to the task ofpunching, with sharp, snapping clicks, cutting circular bits ofleather out of the side of the upper, leaving the holes whichwere to hold the laces.  After observing a few times, the girllet her work at it alone.  Seeing that it was fairly well done,she went away.
　　The pieces of leather came from the girl at the machine to herright, and were passed on to the girl at her left.  Carrie saw atonce that an average speed was necessary or the work would pileup on her and all those below would be delayed.  She had no timeto look about, and bent anxiously to her task.  The girls at herleft and right realised her predicament and feelings, and, in away, tried to aid her, as much as they dared, by working slower.
　　At this task she laboured incessantly for some time, findingrelief from her own nervous fears and imaginings in the humdrum,mechanical movement of the machine.  She felt, as the minutespassed, that the room was not very light.  It had a thick odourof fresh leather, but that did not worry her.  She felt the eyesof the other help upon her, and troubled lest she was not workingfast enough.
　　Once, when she was fumbling at the little clamp, having made aslight error in setting in the leather, a great hand appearedbefore her eyes and fastened the clamp for her.  It was theforeman.  Her heart thumped so that she could scarcely see to goon.
　　"Start your machine," he said, "start your machine. Don't keepthe line waiting."
　　This recovered her sufficiently and she went excitedly on, hardlybreathing until the shadow moved away from behind her.  Then sheheaved a great breath.
　　As the morning wore on the room became hotter.  She felt the needof a breath of fresh air and a drink of water, but did notventure to stir.  The stool she sat on was without a back orfoot-rest, and she began to feel uncomfortable.  She found, aftera time, that her back was beginning to ache.  She twisted andturned from one position to another slightly different, but itdid not ease her for long.  She was beginning to weary.
　　"Stand up, why don't you?" said the girl at her right, withoutany form of introduction.  "They won't care."
　　Carrie looked at her gratefully.  "I guess I will," she said.
　　She stood up from her stool and worked that way for a while, butit was a more difficult position.  Her neck and shoulders achedin bending over.
　　The spirit of the place impressed itself on her in a rough way.She did not venture to look around, but above the clack of themachine she could hear an occasional remark.  She could also notea thing or two out of the side of her eye.
　　"Did you see Harry last night?" said the girl at her left,addressing her neighbour.
　　"No."
　　"You ought to have seen the tie he had on.  Gee, but he was amark."
　　"S-s-t," said the other girl, bending over her work. The first,silenced, instantly assumed a solemn face. The foreman passedslowly along, eyeing each worker distinctly.  The moment he wasgone, the conversation was resumed again.
　　"Say," began the girl at her left, "what jeh think he said?"
　　"I don't know."
　　"He said he saw us with Eddie Harris at Martin's last night.""No!"  They both giggled.
　　A youth with tan-coloured hair, that needed clipping very badly,came shuffling along between the machines, bearing a basket ofleather findings under his left arm, and pressed against hisstomach.  When near Carrie, he stretched out his right hand andgripped one girl under the arm.
　　"Aw, let me go," she exclaimed angrily.  "Duffer."
　　He only grinned broadly in return.
　　"Rubber!" he called back as she looked after him. There wasnothing of the gallant in him.
　　Carrie at last could scarcely sit still.  Her legs began to tireand she wanted to get up and stretch. Would noon never come?  Itseemed as if she had worked an entire day.  She was not hungry atall, but weak, and her eyes were tired, straining at the onepoint where the eye-punch came down.  The girl at the rightnoticed her squirmings and felt sorry for her.  She wasconcentrating herself too thoroughly--what she did reallyrequired less mental and physical strain.  There was nothing tobe done, however.  The halves of the uppers came piling steadilydown.  Her hands began to ache at the wrists and then in thefingers, and towards the last she seemed one mass of dull,complaining muscles, fixed in an eternal position and performinga single mechanical movement which became more and moredistasteful, until as last it was absolutely nauseating.  Whenshe was wondering whether the strain would ever cease, a dull-sounding bell clanged somewhere down an elevator shaft, and theend came.  In an instant there was a buzz of action andconversation. All the girls instantly left their stools andhurried away in an adjoining room, men passed through, comingfrom some department which opened on the right.  The whirlingwheels began to sing in a steadily modifying key, until at lastthey died away in a low buzz.  There was an audible stillness, inwhich the common voice sounded strange.
　　Carrie got up and sought her lunch box.  She was stiff, a littledizzy, and very thirsty.  On the way to the small space portionedoff by wood, where all the wraps and lunches were kept, sheencountered the foreman, who stared at her hard.
　　"Well," he said, "did you get along all right?"
　　"I think so," she replied, very respectfully.
　　"Um," he replied, for want of something better, and walked on.
　　Under better material conditions, this kind of work would nothave been so bad, but the new socialism which involves pleasantworking conditions for employees had not then taken hold uponmanufacturing companies.
　　The place smelled of the oil of the machines and the new leather--a combination which, added to the stale odours of the building,was not pleasant even in cold weather.  The floor, thoughregularly swept every evening, presented a littered surface.  Notthe slightest provision had been made for the comfort of theemployees, the idea being that something was gained by givingthem as little and making the work as hard and unremunerative aspossible.  What we know of foot-rests, swivel-back chairs,dining-rooms for the girls, clean aprons and curling ironssupplied free, and a decent cloak room, were unthought of.  Thewashrooms were disagreeable, crude, if not foul places, and thewhole atmosphere was sordid.
　　Carrie looked about her, after she had drunk a tinful of waterfrom a bucket in one corner, for a place to sit and eat.  Theother girls had ranged themselves about the windows or the work-benches of those of the men who had gone out.  She saw no placewhich did not hold a couple or a group of girls, and being tootimid to think of intruding herself, she sought out her machineand, seated upon her stool, opened her lunch on her lap.  Thereshe sat listening to the chatter and comment about her.  It was,for the most part, silly and graced by the current slang.Several of the men in the room exchanged compliments with thegirls at long range.
　　"Say, Kitty," called one to a girl who was doing a waltz step ina few feet of space near one of the windows, "are you going tothe ball with me?"
　　"Look out, Kitty," called another, "you'll jar your back hair."
　　"Go on, Rubber," was her only comment.
　　As Carrie listened to this and much more of similar familiarbadinage among the men and girls, she instinctively withdrew intoherself.  She was not used to this type, and felt that there wassomething hard and low about it all.  She feared that the youngboys about would address such remarks to her--boys who, besideDrouet, seemed uncouth and ridiculous.  She made the averagefeminine distinction between clothes, putting worth, goodness,and distinction in a dress suit, and leaving all the unlovelyqualities and those beneath notice in overalls and jumper.
　　She was glad when the short half hour was over and the wheelsbegan to whirr again.  Though wearied, she would beinconspicuous.  This illusion ended when another young man passedalong the aisle and poked her indifferently in the ribs with histhumb.  She turned about, indignation leaping to her eyes, but hehad gone on and only once turned to grin.  She found it difficultto conquer an inclination to cry.
　　The girl next her noticed her state of mind.  "Don't you mind,"she said.  "He's too fresh."
　　Carrie said nothing, but bent over her work.  She felt as thoughshe could hardly endure such a life.  Her idea of work had beenso entirely different.  All during the long afternoon she thoughtof the city outside and its imposing show, crowds, and finebuildings.  Columbia City and the better side of her home lifecame back.  By three o'clock she was sure it must be six, and byfour it seemed as if they had forgotten to note the hour and wereletting all work overtime.  The foreman became a true ogre,prowling constantly about, keeping her tied down to her miserabletask.  What she heard of the conversation about her only made herfeel sure that she did not want to make friends with any ofthese.  When six o'clock came she hurried eagerly away, her armsaching and her limbs stiff from sitting in one position.
　　As she passed out along the hall after getting her hat, a youngmachine hand, attracted by her looks, made bold to jest with her.
　　"Say, Maggie," he called, "if you wait, I'll walk with you."
　　It was thrown so straight in her direction that she knew who wasmeant, but never turned to look.
　　In the crowded elevator, another dusty, toil-stained youth triedto make an impression on her by leering in her face.
　　One young man, waiting on the walk outside for the appearance ofanother, grinned at her as she passed.
　　"Ain't going my way, are you?" he called jocosely.
　　Carrie turned her face to the west with a subdued heart.  As sheturned the corner, she saw through the great shiny window thesmall desk at which she had applied.  There were the crowds,hurrying with the same buzz and energy-yielding enthusiasm.  Shefelt a slight relief, but it was only at her escape.  She feltashamed in the face of better dressed girls who went by.  Shefelt as though she should be better served, and her heartrevolted.
　　Chapter V
　　A GLITTERING NIGHT FLOWER--THE USE OF A NAME
　　Drouet did not call that evening.  After receiving the letter, hehad laid aside all thought of Carrie for the time being and wasfloating around having what he considered a gay time.  On thisparticular evening he dined at "Rector's," a restaurant of somelocal fame, which occupied a basement at Clark and MonroeStreets. There--after he visited the resort of Fitzgerald andMoy's in Adams Street, opposite the imposing Federal Building.There he leaned over the splendid bar and swallowed a glass ofplain whiskey and purchased a couple of cigars, one of which helighted.  This to him represented in part high life--a fairsample of what the whole must be.  Drouet was not a drinker inexcess. He was not a moneyed man.  He only craved the best, ashis mind conceived it, and such doings seemed to him a part ofthe best.  Rector's, with its polished marble walls and floor,its profusion of lights, its show of china and silverware, and,above all, its reputation as a resort for actors and professionalmen, seemed to him the proper place for a successful man to go.He loved fine clothes, good eating, and particularly the companyand acquaintanceship of successful men.  When dining, it was asource of keen satisfaction to him to know that Joseph Jeffersonwas wont to come to this same place, or that Henry E. Dixie, awell-known performer of the day, was then only a few tables off.At Rector's he could always obtain this satisfaction, for thereone could encounter politicians, brokers, actors, some rich young"rounders" of the town, all eating and drinking amid a buzz ofpopular commonplace conversation.
　　"That's So-and-so over there," was a common remark of thesegentlemen among themselves, particularly among those who had notyet reached, but hoped to do so, the dazzling height which moneyto dine here lavishly represented.
　　"You don't say so," would be the reply.
　　"Why, yes, didn't you know that?  Why, he's manager of the GrandOpera House."
　　When these things would fall upon Drouet's ears, he wouldstraighten himself a little more stiffly and eat with solidcomfort.  If he had any vanity, this augmented it, and if he hadany ambition, this stirred it.  He would be able to flash a rollof greenbacks too some day.  As it was, he could eat where THEYdid.
　　His preference for Fitzgerald and Moy's Adams Street place wasanother yard off the same cloth.  This was really a gorgeoussaloon from a Chicago standpoint. Like Rector's, it was alsoornamented with a blaze of incandescent lights, held in handsomechandeliers.  The floors were of brightly coloured tiles, thewalls a composition of rich, dark, polished wood, which reflectedthe light, and coloured stucco-work, which gave the place a verysumptuous appearance.  The long bar was a blaze of lights,polished woodwork, coloured and cut glassware, and many fancybottles.  It was a truly swell saloon, with rich screens, fancywines, and a line of bar goods unsurpassed in the country.
　　At Rector's, Drouet had met Mr. G. W. Hurstwood, manager ofFitzgerald and Moy's.  He had been pointed out as a verysuccessful and well-known man about town. Hurstwood looked thepart, for, besides being slightly under forty, he had a good,stout constitution, an active manner, and a solid, substantialair, which was composed in part of his fine clothes, his cleanlinen, his jewels, and, above all, his own sense of hisimportance.  Drouet immediately conceived a notion of him asbeing some one worth knowing, and was glad not only to meet him,but to visit the Adams Street bar thereafter whenever he wanted adrink or a cigar.
　　Hurstwood was an interesting character after his kind. He wasshrewd and clever in many little things, and capable of creatinga good impression.  His managerial position was fairly important--a kind of stewardship which was imposing, but lacked financialcontrol.  He had risen by perseverance and industry, through longyears of service, from the position of barkeeper in a commonplacesaloon to his present altitude.  He had a little office in theplace, set off in polished cherry and grill-work, where he kept,in a roll-top desk, the rather simple accounts of the place--supplies ordered and needed.  The chief executive and financialfunctions devolved upon the owners--Messrs. Fitzgerald and Moy--and upon a cashier who looked after the money taken in.
　　For the most part he lounged about, dressed in excellent tailoredsuits of imported goods, a solitaire ring, a fine blue diamond inhis tie, a striking vest of some new pattern, and a watch-chainof solid gold, which held a charm of rich design, and a watch ofthe latest make and engraving.  He knew by name, and could greetpersonally with a "Well, old fellow," hundreds of actors,merchants, politicians, and the general run of successfulcharacters about town, and it was part of his success to do so.He had a finely graduated scale of informality and friendship,which improved from the "How do you do?" addressed to thefifteen-dollar-a-week clerks and office attaches, who, by longfrequenting of the place, became aware of his position, to the"Why, old man, how are you?" which he addressed to those noted orrich individuals who knew him and were inclined to be friendly.There was a class, however, too rich, too famous, or toosuccessful, with whom he could not attempt any familiarity ofaddress, and with these he was professionally tactful, assuming agrave and dignified attitude, paying them the deference whichwould win their good feeling without in the least compromisinghis own bearing and opinions.  There were, in the last place, afew good followers, neither rich nor poor, famous, nor yetremarkably successful, with whom he was friendly on the score ofgood-fellowship. These were the kind of men with whom he wouldconverse longest and most seriously.  He loved to go out and havea good time once in a while--to go to the races, the theatres,the sporting entertainments at some of the clubs.  He kept ahorse and neat trap, had his wife and two children, who were wellestablished in a neat house on the North Side near Lincoln Park,and was altogether a very acceptable individual of our greatAmerican upper class--the first grade below the luxuriously rich.
　　Hurstwood liked Drouet.  The latter's genial nature and dressyappearance pleased him.  He knew that Drouet was only atravelling salesman--and not one of many years at that--but thefirm of Bartlett, Caryoe & Company was a large and prosperoushouse, and Drouet stood well. Hurstwood knew Caryoe quite well,having drunk a glass now and then with him, in company withseveral others, when the conversation was general.  Drouet hadwhat was a help in his business, a moderate sense of humour, andcould tell a good story when the occasion required.  He couldtalk races with Hurstwood, tell interesting incidents concerninghimself and his experiences with women, and report the state oftrade in the cities which he visited, and so managed to makehimself almost invariably agreeable.  To-night he wasparticularly so, since his report to the company had beenfavourably commented upon, his new samples had beensatisfactorily selected, and his trip marked out for the next sixweeks.
　　"Why, hello, Charlie, old man," said Hurstwood, as Drouet came inthat evening about eight o'clock.  "How goes it?"  The room wascrowded.
　　Drouet shook hands, beaming good nature, and they strolledtowards the bar.
　　"Oh, all right."
　　"I haven't seen you in six weeks.  When did you get in?"
　　"Friday," said Drouet.  "Had a fine trip."
　　"Glad of it," said Hurstwood, his black eyes lit with a warmthwhich half displaced the cold make-believe that usually dwelt inthem.  "What are you going to take?" he added, as the barkeeper,in snowy jacket and tie, leaned toward them from behind the bar.
　　"Old Pepper," said Drouet.
　　"A little of the same for me," put in Hurstwood.
　　"How long are you in town this time?" inquired Hurstwood.
　　"Only until Wednesday.  I'm going up to St. Paul."
　　"George Evans was in here Saturday and said he saw you inMilwaukee last week."
　　"Yes, I saw George," returned Drouet.  "Great old boy, isn't he?We had quite a time there together."
　　The barkeeper was setting out the glasses and bottle before them,and they now poured out the draught as they talked, Drouetfilling his to within a third of full, as was considered proper,and Hurstwood taking the barest suggestion of whiskey andmodifying it with seltzer.
　　"What's become of Caryoe?" remarked Hurstwood.  "I haven't seenhim around here in two weeks."
　　"Laid up, they say," exclaimed Drouet.  "Say, he's a gouty oldboy!"
　　"Made a lot of money in his time, though, hasn't he?"
　　"Yes, wads of it," returned Drouet.  "He won't live much longer.Barely comes down to the office now."
　　"Just one boy, hasn't he?" asked Hurstwood.
　　"Yes, and a swift-pacer," laughed Drouet.
　　"I guess he can't hurt the business very much, though, with theother members all there."
　　"No, he can't injure that any, I guess."
　　Hurstwood was standing, his coat open, his thumbs in his pockets,the light on his jewels and rings relieving them with agreeabledistinctness.  He was the picture of fastidious comfort.
　　To one not inclined to drink, and gifted with a more serious turnof mind, such a bubbling, chattering, glittering chamber mustever seem an anomaly, a strange commentary on nature and life.Here come the moths, in endless procession, to bask in the lightof the flame. Such conversation as one may hear would not warranta commendation of the scene upon intellectual grounds. It seemsplain that schemers would choose more sequestered quarters toarrange their plans, that politicians would not gather here incompany to discuss anything save formalities, where the sharp-eared may hear, and it would scarcely be justified on the scoreof thirst, for the majority of those who frequent these moregorgeous places have no craving for liquor. Nevertheless, thefact that here men gather, here chatter, here love to pass andrub elbows, must be explained upon some grounds.  It must be thata strange bundle of passions and vague desires give rise to sucha curious social institution or it would not be.
　　Drouet, for one, was lured as much by his longing for pleasure asby his desire to shine among his betters. The many friends he methere dropped in because they craved, without, perhaps,consciously analysing it, the company, the glow, the atmospherewhich they found. One might take it, after all, as an augur ofthe better social order, for the things which they satisfiedhere, though sensory, were not evil.  No evil could come out ofthe contemplation of an expensively decorated chamber.  The worsteffect of such a thing would be, perhaps, to stir up in thematerial-minded an ambition to arrange their lives upon asimilarly splendid basis. In the last analysis, that wouldscarcely be called the fault of the decorations, but rather ofthe innate trend of the mind.  That such a scene might stir theless expensively dressed to emulate the more expensively dressedcould scarcely be laid at the door of anything save the falseambition of the minds of those so affected.  Remove the elementso thoroughly and solely complained of--liquor--and there wouldnot be one to gainsay the qualities of beauty and enthusiasmwhich would remain.  The pleased eye with which our modernrestaurants of fashion are looked upon is proof of thisassertion.
　　Yet, here is the fact of the lighted chamber, the dressy, greedycompany, the small, self-interested palaver, the disorganized,aimless, wandering mental action which it represents--the love oflight and show and finery which, to one outside, under the serenelight of the eternal stars, must seem a strange and shiny thing.Under the stars and sweeping night winds, what a lamp-flower itmust bloom; a strange, glittering night-flower, odour-yielding,insect-drawing, insect-infested rose of pleasure.
　　"See that fellow coming in there?" said Hurstwood, glancing at agentleman just entering, arrayed in a high hat and Prince Albertcoat, his fat cheeks puffed and red as with good eating.
　　"No, where?" said Drouet.
　　"There," said Hurstwood, indicating the direction by a cast ofhis eye, "the man with the silk hat."
　　"Oh, yes," said Drouet, now affecting not to see.  "Who is he?"
　　"That's Jules Wallace, the spiritualist."
　　Drouet followed him with his eyes, much interested.
　　"Doesn't look much like a man who sees spirits, does he?" saidDrouet.
　　"Oh, I don't know," returned Hurstwood.  "He's got the money, allright," and a little twinkle passed over his eyes.
　　"I don't go much on those things, do you?" asked Drouet.
　　"Well, you never can tell," said Hurstwood.  "There may besomething to it.  I wouldn't bother about it myself, though.  Bythe way," he added, "are you going anywhere to-night?"
　　"'The Hole in the Ground,'" said Drouet, mentioning the popularfarce of the time.
　　"Well, you'd better be going.  It's half after eight already,"and he drew out his watch.
　　The crowd was already thinning out considerably--some bound forthe theatres, some to their clubs, and some to that mostfascinating of all the pleasures--for the type of man thererepresented, at least--the ladies.
　　"Yes, I will," said Drouet.
　　"Come around after the show.  I have something I want to showyou," said Hurstwood.
　　"Sure," said Drouet, elated.
　　"You haven't anything on hand for the night, have you?" addedHurstwood.
　　"Not a thing."
　　"Well, come round, then."
　　"I struck a little peach coming in on the train Friday," remarkedDrouet, by way of parting.  "By George, that's so, I must go andcall on her before I go away."
　　"Oh, never mind her," Hurstwood remarked.
　　"Say, she was a little dandy, I tell you," went on Drouetconfidentially, and trying to impress his friend.
　　"Twelve o'clock," said Hurstwood.
　　"That's right," said Drouet, going out.
　　Thus was Carrie's name bandied about in the most frivolous andgay of places, and that also when the little toiler was bemoaningher narrow lot, which was almost inseparable from the earlystages of this, her unfolding fate.
　　Chapter VI
　　THE MACHINE AND THE MAIDEN--A KNIGHT OF TO-DAY
　　At the flat that evening Carrie felt a new phase of itsatmosphere.  The fact that it was unchanged, while her feelingswere different, increased her knowledge of its character.Minnie, after the good spirits Carrie manifested at first,expected a fair report.  Hanson supposed that Carrie would besatisfied.
　　"Well," he said, as he came in from the hall in his workingclothes, and looked at Carrie through the dining-room door, "howdid you make out?"
　　"Oh," said Carrie, "it's pretty hard.  I don't like it."
　　There was an air about her which showed plainer than any wordsthat she was both weary and disappointed.
　　"What sort of work is it?" he asked, lingering a moment as heturned upon his heel to go into the bathroom.
　　"Running a machine," answered Carrie.
　　It was very evident that it did not concern him much, save fromthe side of the flat's success.  He was irritated a shade becauseit could not have come about in the throw of fortune for Carrieto be pleased.
　　Minnie worked with less elation than she had just before Carriearrived.  The sizzle of the meat frying did not sound quite sopleasing now that Carrie had reported her discontent.  To Carrie,the one relief of the whole day would have been a jolly home, asympathetic reception, a bright supper table, and some one tosay: "Oh, well, stand it a little while.  You will get somethingbetter," but now this was ashes. She began to see that theylooked upon her complaint as unwarranted, and that she wassupposed to work on and say nothing.  She knew that she was topay four dollars for her board and room, and now she felt that itwould be an exceedingly gloomy round, living with these people.
　　Minnie was no companion for her sister--she was too old.  Herthoughts were staid and solemnly adapted to a condition.  IfHanson had any pleasant thoughts or happy feelings he concealedthem.  He seemed to do all his mental operations without the aidof physical expression.  He was as still as a deserted chamber.Carrie, on the other hand, had the blood of youth and someimagination.  Her day of love and the mysteries of courtship werestill ahead.  She could think of things she would like to do, ofclothes she would like to wear, and of places she would like tovisit.  These were the things upon which her mind ran, and it waslike meeting with opposition at every turn to find no one here tocall forth or respond to her feelings.
　　She had forgotten, in considering and explaining the result ofher day, that Drouet might come.  Now, when she saw howunreceptive these two people were, she hoped he would not.  Shedid not know exactly what she would do or how she would explainto Drouet, if he came. After supper she changed her clothes.When she was trimly dressed she was rather a sweet little being,with large eyes and a sad mouth. Her face expressed the mingledexpectancy, dissatisfaction, and depression she felt.  Shewandered about after the dishes were put away, talked a littlewith Minnie, and then decided to go down and stand in the door atthe foot of the stairs. If Drouet came, she could meet him there.Her face took on the semblance of a look of happiness as she puton her hat to go below.
　　"Carrie doesn't seem to like her place very well," said Minnie toher husband when the latter came out, paper in hand, to sit inthe dining-room a few minutes.
　　"She ought to keep it for a time, anyhow," said Hanson. "Has shegone downstairs?"
　　"Yes," said Minnie.
　　"I'd tell her to keep it if I were you.  She might be here weekswithout getting another one."
　　Minnie said she would, and Hanson read his paper.
　　"If I were you," he said a little later, "I wouldn't let herstand in the door down there.  It don't look good."
　　"I'll tell her," said Minnie.
　　The life of the streets continued for a long time to interestCarrie.  She never wearied of wondering where the people in thecars were going or what their enjoyments were.  Her imaginationtrod a very narrow round, always winding up at points whichconcerned money, looks, clothes, or enjoyment.  She would have afar-off thought of Columbia City now and then, or an irritatingrush of feeling concerning her experiences of the present day,but, on the whole, the little world about her enlisted her wholeattention.
　　The first floor of the building, of which Hanson's flat was thethird, was occupied by a bakery, and to this, while she wasstanding there, Hanson came down to buy a loaf of bread.  She wasnot aware of his presence until he was quite near her.
　　"I'm after bread," was all he said as he passed.
　　The contagion of thought here demonstrated itself. While Hansonreally came for bread, the thought dwelt with him that now hewould see what Carrie was doing. No sooner did he draw near herwith that in mind than she felt it.  Of course, she had nounderstanding of what put it into her head, but, nevertheless, itaroused in her the first shade of real antipathy to him.  Sheknew now that she did not like him.  He was suspicious.
　　A thought will colour a world for us.  The flow of Carrie'smeditations had been disturbed, and Hanson had not long goneupstairs before she followed.  She had realised with the lapse ofthe quarter hours that Drouet was not coming, and somehow shefelt a little resentful, a little as if she had been forsaken--was not good enough.  She went upstairs, where everything wassilent.  Minnie was sewing by a lamp at the table. Hanson hadalready turned in for the night.  In her weariness anddisappointment Carrie did no more than announce that she wasgoing to bed.
　　"Yes, you'd better," returned Minnie.  "You've got to get upearly, you know."
　　The morning was no better.  Hanson was just going out the door asCarrie came from her room.  Minnie tried to talk with her duringbreakfast, but there was not much of interest which they couldmutually discuss.  As on the previous morning, Carrie walked downtown, for she began to realise now that her four-fifty would noteven allow her car fare after she paid her board.  This seemed amiserable arrangement.  But the morning light swept away thefirst misgivings of the day, as morning light is ever wont to do.
　　At the shoe factory she put in a long day, scarcely so wearisomeas the preceding, but considerably less novel.  The head foreman,on his round, stopped by her machine.
　　"Where did you come from?" he inquired.
　　"Mr. Brown hired me," she replied.
　　"Oh, he did, eh!" and then, "See that you keep things going."
　　The machine girls impressed her even less favourably. They seemedsatisfied with their lot, and were in a sense "common." Carriehad more imagination than they. She was not used to slang.  Herinstinct in the matter of dress was naturally better.  Shedisliked to listen to the girl next to her, who was ratherhardened by experience.
　　"I'm going to quit this," she heard her remark to her neighbour."What with the stipend and being up late, it's too much for mehealth."
　　They were free with the fellows, young and old, about the place,and exchanged banter in rude phrases, which at first shocked her.She saw that she was taken to be of the same sort and addressedaccordingly.
　　"Hello," remarked one of the stout-wristed sole-workers to her atnoon.  "You're a daisy." He really expected to hear the common"Aw! go chase yourself!" in return, and was sufficiently abashed,by Carrie's silently moving away, to retreat, awkwardly grinning.
　　That night at the flat she was even more lonely--the dullsituation was becoming harder to endure.  She could see that theHansons seldom or never had any company.  Standing at the streetdoor looking out, she ventured to walk out a little way.  Hereasy gait and idle manner attracted attention of an offensive butcommon sort.  She was slightly taken back at the overtures of awell-dressed man of thirty, who in passing looked at her, reducedhis pace, turned back, and said:
　　"Out for a little stroll, are you, this evening?"
　　Carrie looked at him in amazement, and then summoned sufficientthought to reply: "Why, I don't know you," backing away as shedid so.
　　"Oh, that don't matter," said the other affably.
　　She bandied no more words with him, but hurried away, reachingher own door quite out of breath.  There was something in theman's look which frightened her.
　　During the remainder of the week it was very much the same.  Oneor two nights she found herself too tired to walk home, andexpended car fare.  She was not very strong, and sitting all dayaffected her back.  She went to bed one night before Hanson.
　　Transplantation is not always successful in the matter of flowersor maidens.  It requires sometimes a richer soil, a betteratmosphere to continue even a natural growth.  It would have beenbetter if her acclimatization had been more gradual--less rigid.She would have done better if she had not secured a position soquickly, and had seen more of the city which she constantlytroubled to know about.
　　On the first morning it rained she found that she had noumbrella.  Minnie loaned her one of hers, which was worn andfaded.  There was the kind of vanity in Carrie that troubled atthis.  She went to one of the great department stores and boughtherself one, using a dollar and a quarter of her small store topay for it.
　　"What did you do that for, Carrie?" asked Minnie when she saw it.
　　"Oh, I need one," said Carrie.
　　"You foolish girl."
　　Carrie resented this, though she did not reply.  She was notgoing to be a common shop-girl, she thought; they need not thinkit, either.
　　On the first Saturday night Carrie paid her board, four dollars.Minnie had a quaver of conscience as she took it, but did notknow how to explain to Hanson if she took less.  That worthy gaveup just four dollars less toward the household expenses with asmile of satisfaction.  He contemplated increasing his Buildingand Loan payments.  As for Carrie, she studied over the problemof finding clothes and amusement on fifty cents a week.  Shebrooded over this until she was in a state of mental rebellion.
　　"I'm going up the street for a walk," she said after supper.
　　"Not alone, are you?" asked Hanson.
　　"Yes," returned Carrie.
　　"I wouldn't," said Minnie.
　　"I want to see SOMETHING," said Carrie, and by the tone she putinto the last word they realised for the first time she was notpleased with them.
　　"What's the matter with her?" asked Hanson, when she went intothe front room to get her hat.
　　"I don't know," said Minnie.
　　"Well, she ought to know better than to want to go out alone."
　　Carrie did not go very far, after all.  She returned and stood inthe door.  The next day they went out to Garfield Park, but itdid not please her.  She did not look well enough.  In the shopnext day she heard the highly coloured reports which girls giveof their trivial amusements.  They had been happy.  On severaldays it rained and she used up car fare.  One night she gotthoroughly soaked, going to catch the car at Van Buren Street.All that evening she sat alone in the front room looking out uponthe street, where the lights were reflected on the wet pavements,thinking. She had imagination enough to be moody.
　　On Saturday she paid another four dollars and pocketed her fiftycents in despair.  The speaking acquaintanceship which she formedwith some of the girls at the shop discovered to her the factthat they had more of their earnings to use for themselves thanshe did.  They had young men of the kind whom she, since herexperience with Drouet, felt above, who took them about.  Shecame to thoroughly dislike the light-headed young fellows of theshop.  Not one of them had a show of refinement.  She saw onlytheir workday side.
　　There came a day when the first premonitory blast of winter sweptover the city.  It scudded the fleecy clouds in the heavens,trailed long, thin streamers of smoke from the tall stacks, andraced about the streets and corners in sharp and sudden puffs.Carrie now felt the problem of winter clothes.  What was she todo? She had no winter jacket, no hat, no shoes.  It was difficultto speak to Minnie about this, but at last she summoned thecourage.
　　"I don't know what I'm going to do about clothes," she said oneevening when they were together.  "I need a hat."
　　Minnie looked serious.
　　"Why don't you keep part of your money and buy yourself one?" shesuggested, worried over the situation which the withholding ofCarrie's money would create.
　　"I'd like to for a week or so, if you don't mind," venturedCarrie.
　　"Could you pay two dollars?" asked Minnie.
　　Carrie readily acquiesced, glad to escape the trying situation,and liberal now that she saw a way out.  She was elated and beganfiguring at once.  She needed a hat first of all.  How Minnieexplained to Hanson she never knew.  He said nothing at all, butthere were thoughts in the air which left disagreeableimpressions.
　　The new arrangement might have worked if sickness had notintervened.  It blew up cold after a rain one afternoon whenCarrie was still without a jacket.  She came out of the warm shopat six and shivered as the wind struck her.  In the morning shewas sneezing, and going down town made it worse.  That day herbones ached and she felt light-headed.  Towards evening she feltvery ill, and when she reached home was not hungry.  Minnienoticed her drooping actions and asked her about herself.
　　"I don't know," said Carrie.  "I feel real bad."
　　She hung about the stove, suffered a chattering chill, and wentto bed sick.  The next morning she was thoroughly feverish.
　　Minnie was truly distressed at this, but maintained a kindlydemeanour.  Hanson said perhaps she had better go back home for awhile.  When she got up after three days, it was taken forgranted that her position was lost.  The winter was near at hand,she had no clothes, and now she was out of work.
　　"I don't know," said Carrie; "I'll go down Monday and see if Ican't get something."
　　If anything, her efforts were more poorly rewarded on this trialthan the last.  Her clothes were nothing suitable for fallwearing.  Her last money she had spent for a hat.  For three daysshe wandered about, utterly dispirited.  The attitude of the flatwas fast becoming unbearable.  She hated to think of going backthere each evening.  Hanson was so cold.  She knew it could notlast much longer.  Shortly she would have to give up and go home.
　　On the fourth day she was down town all day, having borrowed tencents for lunch from Minnie.  She had applied in the cheapestkind of places without success. She even answered for a waitressin a small restaurant where she saw a card in the window, butthey wanted an experienced girl.  She moved through the thickthrong of strangers, utterly subdued in spirit.  Suddenly a handpulled her arm and turned her about.
　　"Well, well!" said a voice.  In the first glance she beheldDrouet.  He was not only rosy-cheeked, but radiant.  He was theessence of sunshine and good-humour.  "Why, how are you, Carrie?"he said.  "You're a daisy.  Where have you been?"
　　Carrie smiled under his irresistible flood of geniality.
　　"I've been out home," she said.
　　"Well," he said, "I saw you across the street there. I thought itwas you.  I was just coming out to your place.  How are you,anyhow?"
　　"I'm all right," said Carrie, smiling.
　　Drouet looked her over and saw something different.
　　"Well," he said, "I want to talk to you.  You're not goinganywhere in particular, are you?"
　　"Not just now," said Carrie.
　　"Let's go up here and have something to eat.  George! but I'mglad to see you again."
　　She felt so relieved in his radiant presence, so much lookedafter and cared for, that she assented gladly, though with theslightest air of holding back.
　　"Well," he said, as he took her arm--and there was an exuberanceof good-fellowship in the word which fairly warmed the cockles ofher heart.
　　They went through Monroe Street to the old Windsor dining-room,which was then a large, comfortable place, with an excellentcuisine and substantial service. Drouet selected a table close bythe window, where the busy rout of the street could be seen.  Heloved the changing panorama of the street--to see and be seen ashe dined.
　　"Now," he said, getting Carrie and himself comfortably settled,"what will you have?"
　　Carrie looked over the large bill of fare which the waiter handedher without really considering it.  She was very hungry, and thethings she saw there awakened her desires, but the high pricesheld her attention. "Half broiled spring chicken--seventy-five.Sirloin steak with mushrooms--one twenty-five." She had dimlyheard of these things, but it seemed strange to be called toorder from the list.
　　"I'll fix this," exclaimed Drouet.  "Sst! waiter."
　　That officer of the board, a full-chested, round-faced negro,approached, and inclined his ear.
　　"Sirloin with mushrooms," said Drouet.  "Stuffed tomatoes."
　　"Yassah," assented the negro, nodding his head.
　　"Hashed brown potatoes."
　　"Yassah."
　　"Asparagus."
　　"Yassah."
　　"And a pot of coffee."
　　Drouet turned to Carrie.  "I haven't had a thing since breakfast.Just got in from Rock Island.  I was going off to dine when I sawyou."
　　Carrie smiled and smiled.
　　"What have you been doing?" he went on.  "Tell me all aboutyourself.  How is your sister?"
　　"She's well," returned Carrie, answering the last query.
　　He looked at her hard.
　　"Say," he said, "you haven't been sick, have you?"
　　Carrie nodded.
　　"Well, now, that's a blooming shame, isn't it?  You don't lookvery well.  I thought you looked a little pale.  What have youbeen doing?"
　　"Working," said Carrie.
　　"You don't say so!  At what?"
　　She told him.
　　"Rhodes, Morgenthau and Scott--why, I know that house. over hereon Fifth Avenue, isn't it?  They're a close-fisted concern.  Whatmade you go there?"
　　"I couldn't get anything else," said Carrie frankly.
　　"Well, that's an outrage," said Drouet.  "You oughtn't to beworking for those people.  Have the factory right back of thestore, don't they?"
　　"Yes," said Carrie.
　　"That isn't a good house," said Drouet.  "You don't want to workat anything like that, anyhow."
　　He chatted on at a great rate, asking questions, explainingthings about himself, telling her what a good restaurant it was,until the waiter returned with an immense tray, bearing the hotsavoury dishes which had been ordered.  Drouet fairly shone inthe matter of serving.  He appeared to great advantage behind thewhite napery and silver platters of the table and displaying hisarms with a knife and fork.  As he cut the meat his rings almostspoke.  His new suit creaked as he stretched to reach the plates,break the bread, and pour the coffee.  He helped Carrie to arousing plateful and contributed the warmth of his spirit to herbody until she was a new girl.  He was a splendid fellow in thetrue popular understanding of the term, and captivated Carriecompletely.
　　That little soldier of fortune took her good turn in an easy way.She felt a little out of place, but the great room soothed herand the view of the well-dressed throng outside seemed a splendidthing.  Ah, what was it not to have money!  What a thing it wasto be able to come in here and dine!  Drouet must be fortunate.He rode on trains, dressed in such nice clothes, was so strong,and ate in these fine places.  He seemed quite a figure of a man,and she wondered at his friendship and regard for her.
　　"So you lost your place because you got sick, eh?" he said."What are you going to do now?"
　　"Look around," she said, a thought of the need that hung outsidethis fine restaurant like a hungry dog at her heels passing intoher eyes.
　　"Oh, no," said Drouet, "that won't do.  How long have you beenlooking?"
　　"Four days," she answered.
　　"Think of that!" he said, addressing some problematicalindividual.  "You oughtn't to be doing anything like that.  Thesegirls," and he waved an inclusion of all shop and factory girls,"don't get anything.  Why, you can't live on it, can you?"
　　He was a brotherly sort of creature in his demeanour. When he hadscouted the idea of that kind of toil, he took another tack.Carrie was really very pretty. Even then, in her commonplacegarb, her figure was evidently not bad, and her eyes were largeand gentle. Drouet looked at her and his thoughts reached home.She felt his admiration.  It was powerfully backed by hisliberality and good-humour.  She felt that she liked him--thatshe could continue to like him ever so much.  There was somethingeven richer than that, running as a hidden strain, in her mind.Every little while her eyes would meet his, and by that means theinterchanging current of feeling would be fully connected.
　　"Why don't you stay down town and go to the theatre with me?" hesaid, hitching his chair closer.  The table was not very wide.
　　"Oh, I can't," she said.
　　"What are you going to do to-night?"
　　"Nothing," she answered, a little drearily.
　　"You don't like out there where you are, do you?"
　　"Oh, I don't know."
　　"What are you going to do if you don't get work?"
　　"Go back home, I guess."
　　There was the least quaver in her voice as she said this.Somehow, the influence he was exerting was powerful.  They cameto an understanding of each other without words--he of hersituation, she of the fact that he realised it."No," he said, "you can't make it!" genuine sympathy filling hismind for the time.  "Let me help you.  You take some of mymoney."
　　"Oh, no!" she said, leaning back.
　　"What are you going to do?" he said.
　　She sat meditating, merely shaking her head.
　　He looked at her quite tenderly for his kind.  There were someloose bills in his vest pocket--greenbacks. They were soft andnoiseless, and he got his fingers about them and crumpled them upin his hand.
　　"Come on," he said, "I'll see you through all right. Get yourselfsome clothes."
　　It was the first reference he had made to that subject, and nowshe realised how bad off she was.  In his crude way he had struckthe key-note.  Her lips trembled a little.
　　She had her hand out on the table before her.  They were quitealone in their corner, and he put his larger, warmer hand overit.
　　"Aw, come, Carrie," he said, "what can you do alone? Let me helpyou."
　　He pressed her hand gently and she tried to withdraw it.  At thishe held it fast, and she no longer protested.  Then he slippedthe greenbacks he had into her palm, and when she began toprotest, he whispered:
　　"I'll loan it to you--that's all right.  I'll loan it to you."
　　He made her take it.  She felt bound to him by a strange tie ofaffection now.  They went out, and he walked with her far outsouth toward Polk Street, talking.
　　"You don't want to live with those people?" he said in one place,abstractedly.  Carrie heard it, but it made only a slightimpression.
　　"Come down and meet me to morrow," he said, "and we'll go to thematinee.  Will you?"
　　Carrie protested a while, but acquiesced.
　　"You're not doing anything.  Get yourself a nice pair of shoesand a jacket."
　　She scarcely gave a thought to the complication which wouldtrouble her when he was gone.  In his presence, she was of hisown hopeful, easy-way-out mood.
　　"Don't you bother about those people out there," he said atparting.  "I'll help you."
　　Carrie left him, feeling as though a great arm had slipped outbefore her to draw off trouble.  The money she had accepted wastwo soft, green, handsome ten-dollar bills.
　　Chapter VII
　　THE LURE OF THE MATERIAL--BEAUTY SPEAKS FOR ITSELF
　　The true meaning of money yet remains to be popularly explainedand comprehended.  When each individual realises for himself thatthis thing primarily stands for and should only be accepted as amoral due--that it should be paid out as honestly stored energy,and not as a usurped privilege--many of our social, religious,and political troubles will have permanently passed. As forCarrie, her understanding of the moral significance of money wasthe popular understanding, nothing more.  The old definition:"Money: something everybody else has and I must get," would haveexpressed her understanding of it thoroughly.  Some of it she nowheld in her hand--two soft, green ten-dollar bills--and she feltthat she was immensely better off for the having of them.  It wassomething that was power in itself.  One of her order of mindwould have been content to be cast away upon a desert island witha bundle of money, and only the long strain of starvation wouldhave taught her that in some cases it could have no value.  Eventhen she would have had no conception of the relative value ofthe thing; her one thought would, undoubtedly, have concerned thepity of having so much power and the inability to use it.
　　The poor girl thrilled as she walked away from Drouet. She feltashamed in part because she had been weak enough to take it, buther need was so dire, she was still glad.  Now she would have anice new jacket!  Now she would buy a nice pair of pretty buttonshoes.  She would get stockings, too, and a skirt, and, and--until already, as in the matter of her prospective salary, shehad got beyond, in her desires, twice the purchasing power of herbills.
　　She conceived a true estimate of Drouet.  To her, and indeed toall the world, he was a nice, good-hearted man.  There wasnothing evil in the fellow.  He gave her the money out of a goodheart--out of a realisation of her want.  He would not have giventhe same amount to a poor young man, but we must not forget thata poor young man could not, in the nature of things, haveappealed to him like a poor young girl. Femininity affected hisfeelings.  He was the creature of an inborn desire.  Yet nobeggar could have caught his eye and said, "My God, mister, I'mstarving," but he would gladly have handed out what wasconsidered the proper portion to give beggars and thought no moreabout it.  There would have been no speculation, nophilosophising.  He had no mental process in him worthy thedignity of either of those terms.  In his good clothes and finehealth, he was a merry, unthinking moth of the lamp.  Deprived ofhis position, and struck by a few of the involved and bafflingforces which sometimes play upon man, he would have been ashelpless as Carrie--as helpless, as non-understanding, aspitiable, if you will, as she.
　　Now, in regard to his pursuit of women, he meant them no harm,because he did not conceive of the relation which he hoped tohold with them as being harmful.  He loved to make advances towomen, to have them succumb to his charms, not because he was acold-blooded, dark, scheming villain, but because his inborndesire urged him to that as a chief delight.  He was vain, he wasboastful, he was as deluded by fine clothes as any silly-headedgirl.  A truly deep-dyed villain could have hornswaggled him asreadily as he could have flattered a pretty shop-girl.  His finesuccess as a salesman lay in his geniality and the thoroughlyreputable standing of his house.  He bobbed about among men, averitable bundle of enthusiasm--no power worthy the name ofintellect, no thoughts worthy the adjective noble, no feelingslong continued in one strain.  A Madame Sappho would have calledhim a pig; a Shakespeare would have said "my merry child"; old,drinking Caryoe thought him a clever, successful businessman.  Inshort, he was as good as his intellect conceived.
　　The best proof that there was something open and commendableabout the man was the fact that Carrie took the money.  No deep,sinister soul with ulterior motives could have given her fifteencents under the guise of friendship.  The unintellectual are notso helpless.  Nature has taught the beasts of the field to flywhen some unheralded danger threatens.  She has put into thesmall, unwise head of the chipmunk the untutored fear of poisons."He keepeth His creatures whole," was not written of beastsalone.  Carrie was unwise, and, therefore, like the sheep in itsunwisdom, strong in feeling.  The instinct of self-protection,strong in all such natures, was roused but feebly, if at all, bythe overtures of Drouet.
　　When Carrie had gone, he felicitated himself upon her goodopinion.  By George, it was a shame young girls had to be knockedaround like that.  Cold weather coming on and no clothes.  Tough.He would go around to Fitzgerald and Moy's and get a cigar.  Itmade him feel light of foot as he thought about her.
　　Carrie reached home in high good spirits, which she couldscarcely conceal.  The possession of the money involved a numberof points which perplexed her seriously. How should she buy anyclothes when Minnie knew that she had no money?  She had nosooner entered the flat than this point was settled for her.  Itcould not be done.  She could think of no way of explaining.
　　"How did you come out?" asked Minnie, referring to the day.
　　Carrie had none of the small deception which could feel one thingand say something directly opposed.  She would prevaricate, butit would be in the line of her feelings at least.  So instead ofcomplaining when she felt so good, she said:
　　"I have the promise of something."
　　"Where?"
　　"At the Boston Store."
　　"Is it sure promised?" questioned Minnie.
　　"Well, I'm to find out to-morrow," returned Carrie disliking todraw out a lie any longer than was necessary.
　　Minnie felt the atmosphere of good feeling which Carrie broughtwith her.  She felt now was the time to express to Carrie thestate of Hanson's feeling about her entire Chicago venture.
　　"If you shouldn't get it--" she paused, troubled for an easy way.
　　"If I don't get something pretty soon, I think I'll go home."
　　Minnie saw her chance.
　　"Sven thinks it might be best for the winter, anyhow."
　　The situation flashed on Carrie at once.  They were unwilling tokeep her any longer, out of work.  She did not blame Minnie, shedid not blame Hanson very much. Now, as she sat there digestingthe remark, she was glad she had Drouet's money."Yes," she said after a few moments, "I thought of doing that."
　　She did not explain that the thought, however, had aroused allthe antagonism of her nature.  Columbia City, what was there forher?  She knew its dull, little round by heart.  Here was thegreat, mysterious city which was still a magnet for her.  Whatshe had seen only suggested its possibilities.  Now to turn backon it and live the little old life out there--she almostexclaimed against the thought.
　　She had reached home early and went in the front room to think.What could she do?  She could not buy new shoes and wear themhere.  She would need to save part of the twenty to pay her farehome.  She did not want to borrow of Minnie for that.  And yet,how could she explain where she even got that money?  If shecould only get enough to let her out easy.
　　She went over the tangle again and again.  Here, in the morning,Drouet would expect to see her in a new jacket, and that couldn'tbe.  The Hansons expected her to go home, and she wanted to getaway, and yet she did not want to go home.  In the light of theway they would look on her getting money without work, the takingof it now seemed dreadful.  She began to be ashamed.  The wholesituation depressed her.  It was all so clear when she was withDrouet.  Now it was all so tangled, so hopeless--much worse thanit was before, because she had the semblance of aid in her handwhich she could not use.
　　Her spirits sank so that at supper Minnie felt that she must havehad another hard day.  Carrie finally decided that she would givethe money back.  It was wrong to take it.  She would go down inthe morning and hunt for work.  At noon she would meet Drouet asagreed and tell him.  At this decision her heart sank, until shewas the old Carrie of distress.
　　Curiously, she could not hold the money in her hand withoutfeeling some relief.  Even after all her depressing conclusions,she could sweep away all thought about the matter and then thetwenty dollars seemed a wonderful and delightful thing.  Ah,money, money, money!  What a thing it was to have.  How plenty ofit would clear away all these troubles.
　　In the morning she got up and started out a little early.  Herdecision to hunt for work was moderately strong, but the money inher pocket, after all her troubling over it, made the workquestion the least shade less terrible.  She walked into thewholesale district, but as the thought of applying came with eachpassing concern, her heart shrank.  What a coward she was, shethought to herself.  Yet she had applied so often.  It would bethe same old story.  She walked on and on, and finally did gointo one place, with the old result.  She came out feeling thatluck was against her.  It was no use.
　　Without much thinking, she reached Dearborn Street. Here was thegreat Fair store with its multitude of delivery wagons about itslong window display, its crowd of shoppers.  It readily changedher thoughts, she who was so weary of them.  It was here that shehad intended to come and get her new things.  Now for relief fromdistress; she thought she would go in and see.  She would look atthe jackets.
　　There is nothing in this world more delightful than that middlestate in which we mentally balance at times, possessed of themeans, lured by desire, and yet deterred by conscience or want ofdecision.  When Carrie began wandering around the store amid thefine displays she was in this mood.  Her original experience inthis same place had given her a high opinion of its merits.  Nowshe paused at each individual bit of finery, where before she hadhurried on.  Her woman's heart was warm with desire for them.How would she look in this, how charming that would make her!She came upon the corset counter and paused in rich reverie asshe noted the dainty concoctions of colour and lace theredisplayed.  If she would only make up her mind, she could haveone of those now.  She lingered in the jewelry department.  Shesaw the earrings, the bracelets, the pins, the chains.  Whatwould she not have given if she could have had them all!  Shewould look fine too, if only she had some of these things.
　　The jackets were the greatest attraction.  When she entered thestore, she already had her heart fixed upon the peculiar littletan jacket with large mother-of-pearl buttons which was all therage that fall.  Still she delighted to convince herself thatthere was nothing she would like better.  She went about amongthe glass cases and racks where these things were displayed, andsatisfied herself that the one she thought of was the proper one.All the time she wavered in mind, now persuading herself that shecould buy it right away if she chose, now recalling to herselfthe actual condition.  At last the noon hour was dangerouslynear, and she had done nothing.  She must go now and return themoney.
　　Drouet was on the corner when she came up.
　　"Hello," he said, "where is the jacket and"--looking down--"theshoes?"
　　Carrie had thought to lead up to her decision in some intelligentway, but this swept the whole fore-schemed situation by theboard.
　　"I came to tell you that--that I can't take the money."
　　"Oh, that's it, is it?" he returned.  "Well, you come on with me.Let's go over here to Partridge's."
　　Carrie walked with him.  Behold, the whole fabric of doubt andimpossibility had slipped from her mind.  She could not get atthe points that were so serious, the things she was going to makeplain to him.
　　"Have you had lunch yet?  Of course you haven't.  Let's go inhere," and Drouet turned into one of the very nicely furnishedrestaurants off State Street, in Monroe.
　　"I mustn't take the money," said Carrie, after they were settledin a cosey corner, and Drouet had ordered the lunch.  "I can'twear those things out there. They--they wouldn't know where I gotthem."
　　"What do you want to do," he smiled, "go without them?"
　　"I think I'll go home," she said, wearily.
　　"Oh, come," he said, "you've been thinking it over too long.I'll tell you what you do.  You say you can't wear them outthere.  Why don't you rent a furnished room and leave them inthat for a week?"
　　Carrie shook her head.  Like all women, she was there to objectand be convinced.  It was for him to brush the doubts away andclear the path if he could."Why are you going home?" he asked.
　　"Oh, I can't get anything here."
　　They won't keep you?" he remarked, intuitively.
　　"They can't," said Carrie.
　　"I'll tell you what you do," he said.  "You come with me.  I'lltake care of you."
　　Carrie heard this passively.  The peculiar state which she was inmade it sound like the welcome breath of an open door.  Drouetseemed of her own spirit and pleasing.  He was clean, handsome,well-dressed, and sympathetic.  His voice was the voice of afriend.
　　"What can you do back at Columbia City?" he went on, rousing bythe words in Carrie's mind a picture of the dull world she hadleft.  "There isn't anything down there.  Chicago's the place.You can get a nice room here and some clothes, and then you cando something."
　　Carrie looked out through the window into the busy street.  Thereit was, the admirable, great city, so fine when you are not poor.An elegant coach, with a prancing pair of bays, passed by,carrying in its upholstered depths a young lady.
　　"What will you have if you go back?" asked Drouet. There was nosubtle undercurrent to the question.  He imagined that she wouldhave nothing at all of the things he thought worth while.
　　Carrie sat still, looking out.  She was wondering what she coulddo.  They would be expecting her to go home this week.
　　Drouet turned to the subject of the clothes she was going to buy.
　　"Why not get yourself a nice little jacket?  You've got to haveit.  I'll loan you the money.  You needn't worry about taking it.You can get yourself a nice room by yourself.  I won't hurt you."
　　Carrie saw the drift, but could not express her thoughts.  Shefelt more than ever the helplessness of her case.
　　"If I could only get something to do," she said.
　　"Maybe you can," went on Drouet, "if you stay here. You can't ifyou go away.  They won't let you stay out there.  Now, why notlet me get you a nice room?  I won't bother you--you needn't beafraid.  Then, when you get fixed up, maybe you could getsomething."
　　He looked at her pretty face and it vivified his mentalresources.  She was a sweet little mortal to him--there was nodoubt of that.  She seemed to have some power back of heractions.  She was not like the common run of store-girls.  Shewasn't silly.
　　In reality, Carrie had more imagination than he--more taste.  Itwas a finer mental strain in her that made possible herdepression and loneliness.  Her poor clothes were neat, and sheheld her head unconsciously in a dainty way.
　　"Do you think I could get something?" she asked.
　　"Sure," he said, reaching over and filling her cup with tea."I'll help you."
　　She looked at him, and he laughed reassuringly.
　　"Now I'll tell you what we'll do.  We'll go over here toPartridge's and you pick out what you want.  Then we'll lookaround for a room for you.  You can leave the things there.  Thenwe'll go to the show to-night."
　　Carrie shook her head.
　　"Well, you can go out to the flat then, that's all right.  Youdon't need to stay in the room.  Just take it and leave yourthings there."
　　She hung in doubt about this until the dinner was over.
　　"Let's go over and look at the jackets," he said.
　　Together they went.  In the store they found that shine andrustle of new things which immediately laid hold of Carrie'sheart.  Under the influence of a good dinner and Drouet'sradiating presence, the scheme proposed seemed feasible.  Shelooked about and picked a jacket like the one which she hadadmired at The Fair.  When she got it in her hand it seemed somuch nicer.  The saleswoman helped her on with it, and, byaccident, it fitted perfectly.  Drouet's face lightened as he sawthe improvement.  She looked quite smart.
　　"That's the thing," he said.
　　Carrie turned before the glass.  She could not help feelingpleased as she looked at herself.  A warm glow crept into hercheeks.
　　"That's the thing," said Drouet.  "Now pay for it."
　　"It's nine dollars," said Carrie.
　　"That's all right--take it," said Drouet.
　　She reached in her purse and took out one of the bills. The womanasked if she would wear the coat and went off.  In a few minutesshe was back and the purchase was closed.
　　From Partridge's they went to a shoe store, where Carrie wasfitted for shoes.  Drouet stood by, and when he saw how nice theylooked, said, "Wear them." Carrie shook her head, however.  Shewas thinking of returning to the flat.  He bought her a purse forone thing, and a pair of gloves for another, and let her buy thestockings.
　　"To-morrow," he said, "you come down here and buy yourself askirt."
　　In all of Carrie's actions there was a touch of misgiving.  Thedeeper she sank into the entanglement, the more she imagined thatthe thing hung upon the few remaining things she had not done.Since she had not done these, there was a way out.
　　Drouet knew a place in Wabash Avenue where there were rooms.  Heshowed Carrie the outside of these, and said: "Now, you're mysister." He carried the arrangement off with an easy hand when itcame to the selection, looking around, criticising, opining."Her trunk will be here in a day or so," he observed to thelandlady, who was very pleased.
　　When they were alone, Drouet did not change in the least.  Hetalked in the same general way as if they were out in the street.Carrie left her things.
　　"Now," said Drouet, "why don't you move to-night?"
　　"Oh, I can't," said Carrie.
　　"Why not?"
　　"I don't want to leave them so."
　　He took that up as they walked along the avenue.  It was a warmafternoon.  The sun had come out and the wind had died down.  Ashe talked with Carrie, he secured an accurate detail of theatmosphere of the flat.
　　"Come out of it," he said, "they won't care.  I'll help you getalong."
　　She listened until her misgivings vanished.  He would show herabout a little and then help her get something.  He reallyimagined that he would.  He would be out on the road and shecould be working.
　　"Now, I'll tell you what you do," he said, "you go out there andget whatever you want and come away."
　　She thought a long time about this.  Finally she agreed.  Hewould come out as far as Peoria Street and wait for her.  She wasto meet him at half-past eight. At half-past five she reachedhome, and at six her determination was hardened.
　　"So you didn't get it?" said Minnie, referring to Carrie's storyof the Boston Store.
　　Carrie looked at her out of the corner of her eye. "No," sheanswered.
　　"I don't think you'd better try any more this fall," said Minnie.
　　Carrie said nothing.
　　When Hanson came home he wore the same inscrutable demeanour.  Hewashed in silence and went off to read his paper.  At dinnerCarrie felt a little nervous. The strain of her own plans wereconsiderable, and the feeling that she was not welcome here wasstrong.
　　"Didn't find anything, eh?" said Hanson.
　　"No."
　　He turned to his eating again, the thought that it was a burdento have her here dwelling in his mind.  She would have to gohome, that was all.  Once she was away, there would be no morecoming back in the spring.
　　Carrie was afraid of what she was going to do, but she wasrelieved to know that this condition was ending. They would notcare.  Hanson particularly would be glad when she went.  He wouldnot care what became of her.
　　After dinner she went into the bathroom, where they could notdisturb her, and wrote a little note.
　　"Good-bye, Minnie," it read.  "I'm not going home.  I'm going tostay in Chicago a little while and look for work.  Don't worry.I'll be all right."
　　In the front room Hanson was reading his paper.  As usual, shehelped Minnie clear away the dishes and straighten up.  Then shesaid:
　　"I guess I'll stand down at the door a little while." She couldscarcely prevent her voice from trembling.
　　Minnie remembered Hanson's remonstrance.
　　"Sven doesn't think it looks good to stand down there," she said.
　　"Doesn't he?" said Carrie.  "I won't do it any more after this."
　　She put on her hat and fidgeted around the table in the littlebedroom, wondering where to slip the note. Finally she put itunder Minnie's hair-brush.
　　When she had closed the hall-door, she paused a moment andwondered what they would think.  Some thought of the queerness ofher deed affected her.  She went slowly down the stairs.  Shelooked back up the lighted step, and then affected to stroll upthe street.  When she reached the corner she quickened her pace.
　　As she was hurrying away, Hanson came back to his wife.
　　"Is Carrie down at the door again?" he asked.
　　"Yes," said Minnie; "she said she wasn't going to do it anymore."
　　He went over to the baby where it was playing on the floor andbegan to poke his finger at it.
　　Drouet was on the corner waiting, in good spirits.
　　"Hello, Carrie," he said, as a sprightly figure of a girl drewnear him.  "Got here safe, did you?  Well, we'll take a car."
　　Chapter VIII
　　INTIMATIONS BY WINTER--AN AMBASSADOR SUMMONED
　　Among the forces which sweep and play throughout the universe,untutored man is but a wisp in the wind.  Our civilisation isstill in a middle stage, scarcely beast, in that it is no longerwholly guided by instinct; scarcely human, in that it is not yetwholly guided by reason.  On the tiger no responsibility rests.We see him aligned by nature with the forces of life--he is borninto their keeping and without thought he is protected.  We seeman far removed from the lairs of the jungles, his innateinstincts dulled by too near an approach to free-will, his free-will not sufficiently developed to replace his instincts andafford him perfect guidance.
　　He is becoming too wise to hearken always to instincts anddesires; he is still too weak to always prevail against them.  Asa beast, the forces of life aligned him with them; as a man, hehas not yet wholly learned to align himself with the forces.  Inthis intermediate stage he wavers--neither drawn in harmony withnature by his instincts nor yet wisely putting himself intoharmony by his own free-will.  He is even as a wisp in the wind,moved by every breath of passion, acting now by his will and nowby his instincts, erring with one, only to retrieve by the other,falling by one, only to rise by the other--a creature ofincalculable variability.  We have the consolation of knowingthat evolution is ever in action, that the ideal is a light thatcannot fail.  He will not forever balance thus between good andevil.  When this jangle of free-will instinct shall have beenadjusted, when perfect under standing has given the former thepower to replace the latter entirely, man will no longer vary.The needle of understanding will yet point steadfast andunwavering to the distinct pole of truth.
　　In Carrie--as in how many of our worldlings do they not?--instinct and reason, desire and understanding, were at war forthe mastery.  She followed whither her craving led.  She was asyet more drawn than she drew.
　　When Minnie found the note next morning, after a night of mingledwonder and anxiety, which was not exactly touched by yearning,sorrow, or love, she exclaimed: "Well, what do you think ofthat?"
　　"What?" said Hanson.
　　"Sister Carrie has gone to live somewhere else."
　　Hanson jumped out of bed with more celerity than he usuallydisplayed and looked at the note.  The only indication of histhoughts came in the form of a little clicking sound made by histongue; the sound some people make when they wish to urge on ahorse.
　　"Where do you suppose she's gone to?" said Minnie, thoroughlyaroused.
　　"I don't know," a touch of cynicism lighting his eye. "Now shehas gone and done it."
　　Minnie moved her head in a puzzled way.
　　"Oh, oh," she said, "she doesn't know what she has done."
　　"Well," said Hanson, after a while, sticking his hands out beforehim, "what can you do?"
　　Minnie's womanly nature was higher than this.  She figured thepossibilities in such cases.
　　"Oh," she said at last, "poor Sister Carrie!"
　　At the time of this particular conversation, which occurred at 5A.M., that little soldier of fortune was sleeping a rathertroubled sleep in her new room, alone.
　　Carrie's new state was remarkable in that she saw possibilitiesin it.  She was no sensualist, longing to drowse sleepily in thelap of luxury.  She turned about, troubled by her daring, glad ofher release, wondering whether she would get something to do,wondering what Drouet would do.  That worthy had his future fixedfor him beyond a peradventure.  He could not help what he wasgoing to do.  He could not see clearly enough to wish to dodifferently.  He was drawn by his innate desire to act the oldpursuing part.  He would need to delight himself with Carrie assurely as he would need to eat his heavy breakfast.  He mightsuffer the least rudimentary twinge of conscience in whatever hedid, and in just so far he was evil and sinning.  But whatevertwinges of conscience he might have would be rudimentary, you maybe sure.
　　The next day he called upon Carrie, and she saw him in herchamber.  He was the same jolly, enlivening soul.
　　"Aw," he said, "what are you looking so blue about? Come on outto breakfast.  You want to get your other clothes to-day."
　　Carrie looked at him with the hue of shifting thought in herlarge eyes.
　　"I wish I could get something to do," she said.
　　"You'll get that all right," said Drouet.  "What's the useworrying right now?  Get yourself fixed up.  See the city.  Iwon't hurt you."
　　"I know you won't," she remarked, half truthfully.
　　"Got on the new shoes, haven't you?  Stick 'em out. George, theylook fine.  Put on your jacket."
　　Carrie obeyed.
　　"Say, that fits like a T, don't it?" he remarked, feeling the setof it at the waist and eyeing it from a few paces with realpleasure.  "What you need now is a new skirt.  Let's go tobreakfast."
　　Carrie put on her hat.
　　"Where are the gloves?" he inquired.
　　"Here," she said, taking them out of the bureau drawer.
　　"Now, come on," he said.
　　Thus the first hour of misgiving was swept away.
　　It went this way on every occasion.  Drouet did not leave hermuch alone.  She had time for some lone wanderings, but mostly hefilled her hours with sight-seeing.  At Carson, Pirie's he boughther a nice skirt and shirt waist.  With his money she purchasedthe little necessaries of toilet, until at last she looked quiteanother maiden.  The mirror convinced her of a few things whichshe had long believed.  She was pretty, yes, indeed!  How niceher hat set, and weren't her eyes pretty.  She caught her littlered lip with her teeth and felt her first thrill of power.Drouet was so good.
　　They went to see "The Mikado" one evening, an opera which washilariously popular at that time.  Before going, they made offfor the Windsor dining-room, which was in Dearborn Street, aconsiderable distance from Carrie's room.  It was blowing upcold, and out of her window Carrie could see the western sky,still pink with the fading light, but steely blue at the topwhere it met the darkness.  A long, thin cloud of pink hung inmidair, shaped like some island in a far-off sea. Somehow theswaying of some dead branches of trees across the way broughtback the picture with which she was familiar when she looked fromtheir front window in December days at home.She paused and wrung her little hands.
　　"What's the matter?" said Drouet.
　　"Oh, I don't know," she said, her lip trembling.
　　He sensed something, and slipped his arm over her shoulder,patting her arm.
　　"Come on," he said gently, "you're all right."
　　She turned to slip on her jacket.
　　"Better wear that boa about your throat to night."
　　They walked north on Wabash to Adams Street and then west.  Thelights in the stores were already shining out in gushes of goldenhue.  The arc lights were sputtering overhead, and high up werethe lighted windows of the tall office buildings.  The chill windwhipped in and out in gusty breaths.  Homeward bound, the sixo'clock throng bumped and jostled. Light overcoats were turned upabout the ears, hats were pulled down.  Little shop-girls wentfluttering by in pairs and fours, chattering, laughing.  It was aspectacle of warm-blooded humanity.
　　Suddenly a pair of eyes met Carrie's in recognition. They werelooking out from a group of poorly dressed girls.  Their clotheswere faded and loose-hanging, their jackets old, their generalmake-up shabby.
　　Carrie recognised the glance and the girl.  She was one of thosewho worked at the machines in the shoe factory.  The latterlooked, not quite sure, and then turned her head and looked.Carrie felt as if some great tide had rolled between them.  Theold dress and the old machine came back.  She actually started.Drouet didn't notice until Carrie bumped into a pedestrian.
　　"You must be thinking," he said.
　　They dined and went to the theatre.  That spectacle pleasedCarrie immensely.  The colour and grace of it caught her eye.She had vain imaginings about place and power, about far-offlands and magnificent people. When it was over, the clatter ofcoaches and the throng of fine ladies made her stare.
　　"Wait a minute," said Drouet, holding her back in the showy foyerwhere ladies and gentlemen were moving in a social crush, skirtsrustling, lace-covered heads nodding, white teeth showing throughparted lips. "Let's see."
　　"Sixty-seven," the coach-caller was saying, his voice lifted in asort of euphonious cry.  "Sixty-seven."
　　"Isn't it fine?" said Carrie.
　　"Great," said Drouet.  He was as much affected by this show offinery and gayety as she.  He pressed her arm warmly.  Once shelooked up, her even teeth glistening through her smiling lips,her eyes alight.  As they were moving out he whispered down toher, "You look lovely!"  They were right where the coach-callerwas swinging open a coach-door and ushering in two ladies.
　　"You stick to me and we'll have a coach," laughed Drouet.
　　Carrie scarcely heard, her head was so full of the swirl of life.They stopped in at a restaurant for a little after-theatre lunch.Just a shade of a thought of the hour entered Carrie's head, butthere was no household law to govern her now.  If any habits everhad time to fix upon her, they would have operated here.  Habitsare peculiar things.  They will drive the really non-religiousmind out of bed to say prayers that are only a custom and not adevotion.  The victim of habit, when he has neglected the thingwhich it was his custom to do, feels a little scratching in thebrain, a little irritating something which comes of being out ofthe rut, and imagines it to be the prick of conscience, thestill, small voice that is urging him ever to righteousness.  Ifthe digression is unusual enough, the drag of habit will be heavyenough to cause the unreasoning victim to return and perform theperfunctory thing.  "Now, bless me," says such a mind, "I havedone my duty," when, as a matter of fact, it has merely done itsold, unbreakable trick once again.
　　Carrie had no excellent home principles fixed upon her. If shehad, she would have been more consciously distressed.  Now thelunch went off with considerable warmth.  Under the influence ofthe varied occurrences, the fine, invisible passion which wasemanating from Drouet, the food, the still unusual luxury, she
　　relaxed and heard with open ears.  She was again the victim ofthe city's hypnotic influence.
　　"Well," said Drouet at last, "we had better be going."
　　They had been dawdling over the dishes, and their eyes hadfrequently met.  Carrie could not help but feel the vibration offorce which followed, which, indeed, was his gaze.  He had a wayof touching her hand in explanation, as if to impress a fact uponher.  He touched it now as he spoke of going.
　　They arose and went out into the street.  The downtown sectionwas now bare, save for a few whistling strollers, a few owl cars,a few open resorts whose windows were still bright.  Out WabashAvenue they strolled, Drouet still pouring forth his volume ofsmall information.  He had Carrie's arm in his, and held itclosely as he explained.  Once in a while, after some witticism,he would look down, and his eyes would meet hers.  At last theycame to the steps, and Carrie stood up on the first one, her headnow coming even with his own.  He took her hand and held itgenially.  He looked steadily at her as she glanced about, warmlymusing.
　　At about that hour, Minnie was soundly sleeping, after a longevening of troubled thought.  She had her elbow in an awkwardposition under her side.  The muscles so held irritated a fewnerves, and now a vague scene floated in on the drowsy mind.  Shefancied she and Carrie were somewhere beside an old coal-mine.She could see the tall runway and the heap of earth and coal castout.  There was a deep pit, into which they were looking; theycould see the curious wet stones far down where the walldisappeared in vague shadows.  An old basket, used fordescending, was hanging there, fastened by a worn rope.
　　"Let's get in," said Carrie.
　　"Oh, no," said Minnie.
　　"Yes, come on," said Carrie.
　　She began to pull the basket over, and now, in spite of allprotest, she had swung over and was going down.
　　"Carrie," she called, "Carrie, come back"; but Carrie was fardown now and the shadow had swallowed her completely.
　　She moved her arm.
　　Now the mystic scenery merged queerly and the place was by watersshe had never seen.  They were upon some board or ground orsomething that reached far out, and at the end of this wasCarrie.  They looked about, and now the thing was sinking, andMinnie heard the low sip of the encroaching water.
　　"Come on, Carrie," she called, but Carrie was reaching fartherout.  She seemed to recede, and now it was difficult to call toher.
　　"Carrie," she called, "Carrie," but her own voice sounded faraway, and the strange waters were blurring everything.  She cameaway suffering as though she had lost something.  She was moreinexpressibly sad than she had ever been in life.
　　It was this way through many shifts of the tired brain, thosecurious phantoms of the spirit slipping in, blurring strangescenes, one with the other.  The last one made her cry out, forCarrie was slipping away somewhere over a rock, and her fingershad let loose and she had seen her falling.
　　"Minnie!  What's the matter?  Here, wake up," said Hanson,disturbed, and shaking her by the shoulder.
　　"Wha--what's the matter?" said Minnie, drowsily.
　　"Wake up," he said, "and turn over.  You're talking in yoursleep."
　　A week or so later Drouet strolled into Fitzgerald and Moy's,spruce in dress and manner.
　　"Hello, Charley," said Hurstwood, looking out from his officedoor.
　　Drouet strolled over and looked in upon the manager at his desk."When do you go out on the road again?" he inquired.
　　"Pretty soon," said Drouet.
　　"Haven't seen much of you this trip," said Hurstwood.
　　"Well, I've been busy," said Drouet.
　　They talked some few minutes on general topics.
　　"Say," said Drouet, as if struck by a sudden idea, "I want you tocome out some evening."
　　"Out where?" inquired Hurstwood.
　　"Out to my house, of course," said Drouet, smiling.
　　Hurstwood looked up quizzically, the least suggestion of a smilehovering about his lips.  He studied the face of Drouet in hiswise way, and then with the demeanour of a gentleman, said:"Certainly; glad to."
　　"We'll have a nice game of euchre."
　　"May I bring a nice little bottle of Sec?" asked Hurstwood."Certainly," said Drouet.  "I'll introduce you."
　　Chapter IX
　　CONVENTION'S OWN TINDER-BOX--THE EYE THAT IS GREEN
　　Hurstwood's residence on the North Side, near Lincoln Park, was abrick building of a very popular type then, a three-story affairwith the first floor sunk a very little below the level of thestreet.  It had a large bay window bulging out from the secondfloor, and was graced in front by a small grassy plot, twenty-five feet wide and ten feet deep.  There was also a small rearyard, walled in by the fences of the neighbours and holding astable where he kept his horse and trap.
　　The ten rooms of the house were occupied by himself, his wifeJulia, and his son and daughter, George, Jr., and Jessica.  Therewere besides these a maid-servant, represented from time to timeby girls of various extraction, for Mrs. Hurstwood was not alwayseasy to please.
　　"George, I let Mary go yesterday," was not an unfrequentsalutation at the dinner table.
　　"All right," was his only reply.  He had long since wearied ofdiscussing the rancorous subject.
　　A lovely home atmosphere is one of the flowers of the world, thanwhich there is nothing more tender, nothing more delicate,nothing more calculated to make strong and just the naturescradled and nourished within it. Those who have never experiencedsuch a beneficent influence will not understand wherefore thetear springs glistening to the eyelids at some strange breath inlovely music.  The mystic chords which bind and thrill the heartof the nation, they will never know.
　　Hurstwood's residence could scarcely be said to be infused withthis home spirit.  It lacked that toleration and regard withoutwhich the home is nothing.  There was fine furniture, arranged assoothingly as the artistic perception of the occupants warranted.There were soft rugs, rich, upholstered chairs and divans, agrand piano, a marble carving of some unknown Venus by someunknown artist, and a number of small bronzes gathered fromheaven knows where, but generally sold by the large furniturehouses along with everything else which goes to make the"perfectly appointed house."
　　In the dining-room stood a sideboard laden with glisteningdecanters and other utilities and ornaments in glass, thearrangement of which could not be questioned.  Here was somethingHurstwood knew about. He had studied the subject for years in hisbusiness. He took no little satisfaction in telling each Mary,shortly after she arrived, something of what the art of the thingrequired.  He was not garrulous by any means. On the contrary,there was a fine reserve in his manner toward the entire domesticeconomy of his life which was all that is comprehended by thepopular term, gentlemanly.  He would not argue, he would not talkfreely.  In his manner was something of the dogmatist. What hecould not correct, he would ignore.  There was a tendency in himto walk away from the impossible thing.
　　There was a time when he had been considerably enamoured of hisJessica, especially when he was younger and more confined in hissuccess.  Now, however, in her seventeenth year, Jessica haddeveloped a certain amount of reserve and independence which wasnot inviting to the richest form of parental devotion. She was inthe high school, and had notions of life which were decidedlythose of a patrician.  She liked nice clothes and urged for themconstantly.  Thoughts of love and elegant individualestablishments were running in her head.  She met girls at thehigh school whose parents were truly rich and whose fathers hadstanding locally as partners or owners of solid businesses.These girls gave themselves the airs befitting the thrivingdomestic establishments from whence they issued.  They were theonly ones of the school about whom Jessica concerned herself.
　　Young Hurstwood, Jr., was in his twentieth year, and was alreadyconnected in a promising capacity with a large real estate firm.He contributed nothing for the domestic expenses of the family,but was thought to be saving his money to invest in real estate.He had some ability, considerable vanity, and a love of pleasurethat had not, as yet, infringed upon his duties, whatever theywere.  He came in and went out, pursuing his own plans andfancies, addressing a few words to his mother occasionally,relating some little incident to his father, but for the mostpart confining himself to those generalities with which mostconversation concerns itself.  He was not laying bare his desiresfor any one to see.  He did not find any one in the house whoparticularly cared to see.
　　Mrs. Hurstwood was the type of woman who has ever endeavoured toshine and has been more or less chagrined at the evidences ofsuperior capability in this direction elsewhere.  Her knowledgeof life extended to that little conventional round of society ofwhich she was not--but longed to be--a member.  She was notwithout realisation already that this thing was impossible, sofar as she was concerned.  For her daughter, she hoped betterthings.  Through Jessica she might rise a little.  ThroughGeorge, Jr.'s, possible success she might draw to herself theprivilege of pointing proudly.  Even Hurstwood was doing wellenough, and she was anxious that his small real estate adventuresshould prosper.  His property holdings, as yet, were rathersmall, but his income was pleasing and his position withFitzgerald and Moy was fixed.  Both those gentlemen were onpleasant and rather informal terms with him.
　　The atmosphere which such personalities would create must beapparent to all.  It worked out in a thousand littleconversations, all of which were of the same calibre.
　　"I'm going up to Fox Lake to-morrow," announced George, Jr., atthe dinner table one Friday evening.
　　"What's going on up there?" queried Mrs. Hurstwood.
　　"Eddie Fahrway's got a new steam launch, and he wants me to comeup and see how it works."
　　"How much did it cost him?" asked his mother.
　　"Oh, over two thousand dollars.  He says it's a dandy."
　　"Old Fahrway must be making money," put in Hurstwood.
　　"He is, I guess.  Jack told me they were shipping Vegacura toAustralia now--said they sent a whole box to Cape Town lastweek."
　　"Just think of that!" said Mrs. Hurstwood, "and only four yearsago they had that basement in Madison Street."
　　"Jack told me they were going to put up a six-story building nextspring in Robey Street."
　　"Just think of that!" said Jessica.
　　On this particular occasion Hurstwood wished to leave early.
　　"I guess I'll be going down town," he remarked, rising.
　　"Are we going to McVicker's Monday?" questioned Mrs. Hurstwood,without rising.
　　"Yes," he said indifferently.
　　They went on dining, while he went upstairs for his hat and coat.Presently the door clicked.
　　"I guess papa's gone," said Jessica.
　　The latter's school news was of a particular stripe.
　　"They're going to give a performance in the Lyceum, upstairs,"she reported one day, "and I'm going to be in it."
　　"Are you?" said her mother.
　　"Yes, and I'll have to have a new dress.  Some of the nicestgirls in the school are going to be in it.  Miss Palmer is goingto take the part of Portia."
　　"Is she?" said Mrs. Hurstwood.
　　"They've got that Martha Griswold in it again.  She thinks shecan act."
　　"Her family doesn't amount to anything, does it?" said Mrs.Hurstwood sympathetically.  "They haven't anything, have they?"
　　"No," returned Jessica, "they're poor as church mice."
　　She distinguished very carefully between the young boys of theschool, many of whom were attracted by her beauty.
　　"What do you think?" she remarked to her mother one evening;"that Herbert Crane tried to make friends with me."
　　"Who is he, my dear?" inquired Mrs. Hurstwood.
　　"Oh, no one," said Jessica, pursing her pretty lips. "He's just astudent there.  He hasn't anything."
　　The other half of this picture came when young Blyford, son ofBlyford, the soap manufacturer, walked home with her. Mrs.Hurstwood was on the third floor, sitting in a rocking-chairreading, and happened to look out at the time.
　　"Who was that with you, Jessica?" she inquired, as Jessica cameupstairs.
　　"It's Mr. Blyford, mamma," she replied.
　　"Is it?" said Mrs. Hurstwood.
　　"Yes, and he wants me to stroll over into the park with him,"explained Jessica, a little flushed with running up the stairs.
　　"All right, my dear," said Mrs. Hurstwood.  "Don't be gone long."
　　As the two went down the street, she glanced interestedly out ofthe window.  It was a most satisfactory spectacle indeed, mostsatisfactory.
　　In this atmosphere Hurstwood had moved for a number of years, notthinking deeply concerning it.  His was not the order of natureto trouble for something better, unless the better wasimmediately and sharply contrasted.  As it was, he received andgave, irritated sometimes by the little displays of selfishindifference, pleased at times by some show of finery whichsupposedly made for dignity and social distinction.  The life ofthe resort which he managed was his life.  There he spent most ofhis time.  When he went home evenings the house looked nice.With rare exceptions the meals were acceptable, being the kindthat an ordinary servant can arrange.  In part, he was interestedin the talk of his son and daughter, who always looked well.  Thevanity of Mrs. Hurstwood caused her to keep her person rathershowily arrayed, but to Hurstwood this was much better thanplainness. There was no love lost between them.  There was nogreat feeling of dissatisfaction.  Her opinion on any subject wasnot startling.  They did not talk enough together to come to theargument of any one point.  In the accepted and popular phrase,she had her ideas and he had his.  Once in a while he would meeta woman whose youth, sprightliness, and humour would make hiswife seem rather deficient by contrast, but the temporarydissatisfaction which such an encounter might arouse would becounterbalanced by his social position and a certain matter ofpolicy.  He could not complicate his home life, because it mightaffect his relations with his employers.  They wanted noscandals. A man, to hold his position, must have a dignifiedmanner, a clean record, a respectable home anchorage. Thereforehe was circumspect in all he did, and whenever he appeared in thepublic ways in the afternoon, or on Sunday, it was with his wife,and sometimes his children.  He would visit the local resorts, orthose near by in Wisconsin, and spend a few stiff, polished daysstrolling about conventional places doing conventional things.He knew the need of it.
　　When some one of the many middle-class individuals whom he knew,who had money, would get into trouble, he would shake his head.It didn't do to talk about those things.  If it came up fordiscussion among such friends as with him passed for close, hewould deprecate the folly of the thing.  "It was all right to doit--all men do those things--but why wasn't he careful?  A mancan't be too careful."  He lost sympathy for the man that made amistake and was found out.
　　On this account he still devoted some time to showing his wifeabout--time which would have been wearisome indeed if it had notbeen for the people he would meet and the little enjoyments whichdid not depend upon her presence or absence.  He watched her withconsiderable curiosity at times, for she was still attractive ina way and men looked at her.  She was affable, vain, subject toflattery, and this combination, he knew quite well, might producea tragedy in a woman of her home position.  Owing to his order ofmind, his confidence in the sex was not great.  His wife neverpossessed the virtues which would win the confidence andadmiration of a man of his nature.  As long as she loved himvigorously he could see how confidence could be, but when thatwas no longer the binding chain--well, something might happen.
　　During the last year or two the expenses of the family seemed alarge thing.  Jessica wanted fine clothes, and Mrs. Hurstwood,not to be outshone by her daughter, also frequently enlivened herapparel.  Hurstwood had said nothing in the past, but one day hemurmured.
　　"Jessica must have a new dress this month," said Mrs. Hurstwoodone morning.
　　Hurstwood was arraying himself in one of his perfection vestsbefore the glass at the time.
　　"I thought she just bought one," he said.
　　"That was just something for evening wear," returned his wifecomplacently.
　　"It seems to me," returned Hurstwood, "that she's spending a gooddeal for dresses of late."
　　"Well, she's going out more," concluded his wife, but the tone ofhis voice impressed her as containing something she had not heardthere before.
　　He was not a man who traveled much, but when he did, he had beenaccustomed to take her along.  On one occasion recently a localaldermanic junket had been arranged to visit Philadelphia--ajunket that was to last ten days.  Hurstwood had been invited.
　　"Nobody knows us down there," said one, a gentleman whose facewas a slight improvement over gross ignorance and sensuality.  Healways wore a silk hat of most imposing proportions.  "We canhave a good time." His left eye moved with just the semblance ofa wink. "You want to come along, George."
　　The next day Hurstwood announced his intention to his wife.
　　"I'm going away, Julia," he said, "for a few days."
　　"Where?" she asked, looking up.
　　"To Philadelphia, on business."
　　She looked at him consciously, expecting something else.
　　"I'll have to leave you behind this time."
　　"All right," she replied, but he could see that she was thinkingthat it was a curious thing.  Before he went she asked him a fewmore questions, and that irritated him.  He began to feel thatshe was a disagreeable attachment.
　　On this trip he enjoyed himself thoroughly, and when it was overhe was sorry to get back.  He was not willingly a prevaricator,and hated thoroughly to make explanations concerning it.  Thewhole incident was glossed over with general remarks, but Mrs.Hurstwood gave the subject considerable thought.  She drove outmore, dressed better, and attended theatres freely to make up forit.
　　Such an atmosphere could hardly come under the category of homelife.  It ran along by force of habit, by force of conventionalopinion.  With the lapse of time it must necessarily become dryerand dryer--must eventually be tinder, easily lighted anddestroyed.
　　Chapter X
　　THE COUNSEL OF WINTER--FORTUNE'S AMBASSADOR CALLS
　　In the light of the world's attitude toward woman and her duties,the nature of Carrie's mental state deserves consideration.Actions such as hers are measured by an arbitrary scale.  Societypossesses a conventional standard whereby it judges all things.All men should be good, all women virtuous.  Wherefore, villain,hast thou failed?
　　For all the liberal analysis of Spencer and our modernnaturalistic philosophers, we have but an infantile perception ofmorals.  There is more in the subject than mere conformity to alaw of evolution.  It is yet deeper than conformity to things ofearth alone.  It is more involved than we, as yet, perceive.Answer, first, why the heart thrills; explain wherefore someplaintive note goes wandering about the world, undying; makeclear the rose's subtle alchemy evolving its ruddy lamp in lightand rain.  In the essence of these facts lie the first principlesof morals.
　　"Oh," thought Drouet, "how delicious is my conquest."
　　"Ah," thought Carrie, with mournful misgivings, "what is it Ihave lost?"
　　Before this world-old proposition we stand, serious, interested,confused; endeavouring to evolve the true theory of morals--thetrue answer to what is right.
　　In the view of a certain stratum of society, Carrie wascomfortably established--in the eyes of the starveling, beaten byevery wind and gusty sheet of rain, she was safe in a halcyonharbour.  Drouet had taken three rooms, furnished, in OgdenPlace, facing Union Park, on the West Side.  That was a little,green-carpeted breathing spot, than which, to-day, there isnothing more beautiful in Chicago.  It afforded a vista pleasantto contemplate.  The best room looked out upon the lawn of thepark, now sear and brown, where a little lake lay sheltered.Over the bare limbs of the trees, which now swayed in the wintrywind, rose the steeple of the Union Park Congregational Church,and far off the towers of several others.
　　The rooms were comfortably enough furnished.  There was a goodBrussels carpet on the floor, rich in dull red and lemon shades,and representing large jardinieres filled with gorgeous,impossible flowers.  There was a large pier-glass mirror betweenthe two windows.  A large, soft, green, plush-covered couchoccupied one corner, and several rocking-chairs were set about.Some pictures, several rugs, a few small pieces of bric-a-brac,and the tale of contents is told.
　　In the bedroom, off the front room, was Carrie's trunk, bought byDrouet, and in the wardrobe built into the wall quite an array ofclothing--more than she had ever possessed before, and of verybecoming designs.  There was a third room for possible use as akitchen, where Drouet had Carrie establish a little portable gasstove for the preparation of small lunches, oysters, Welshrarebits, and the like, of which he was exceedingly fond; and,lastly, a bath.  The whole place was cosey, in that it waslighted by gas and heated by furnace registers, possessing also asmall grate, set with an asbestos back, a method of cheerfulwarming which was then first coming into use.  By her industryand natural love of order, which now developed, the placemaintained an air pleasing in the extreme.
　　Here, then, was Carrie, established in a pleasant fashion, freeof certain difficulties which most ominously confronted her,laden with many new ones which were of a mental order, andaltogether so turned about in all of her earthly relationshipsthat she might well have been a new and different individual.She looked into her glass and saw a prettier Carrie than she hadseen before; she looked into her mind, a mirror prepared of herown and the world's opinions, and saw a worse.  Between these twoimages she wavered, hesitating which to believe.
　　"My, but you're a little beauty," Drouet was wont to exclaim toher.
　　She would look at him with large, pleased eyes.
　　"You know it, don't you?" he would continue.
　　"Oh, I don't know," she would reply, feeling delight in the factthat one should think so, hesitating to believe, though shereally did, that she was vain enough to think so much of herself.
　　Her conscience, however, was not a Drouet, interested to praise.There she heard a different voice, with which she argued,pleaded, excused.  It was no just and sapient counsellor, in itslast analysis.  It was only an average little conscience, a thingwhich represented the world, her past environment, habit,convention, in a confused way.  With it, the voice of the peoplewas truly the voice of God.
　　"Oh, thou failure!" said the voice.
　　"Why?" she questioned.
　　"Look at those about," came the whispered answer. "Look at thosewho are good.  How would they scorn to do what you have done.Look at the good girls; how will they draw away from such as youwhen they know you have been weak.  You had not tried before youfailed."
　　It was when Carrie was alone, looking out across the park, thatshe would be listening to this.  It would come infrequently--whensomething else did not interfere, when the pleasant side was nottoo apparent, when Drouet was not there.  It was somewhat clearin utterance at first, but never wholly convincing.  There wasalways an answer, always the December days threatened.  She wasalone; she was desireful; she was fearful of the whistling wind.The voice of want made answer for her.
　　Once the bright days of summer pass by, a city takes on thatsombre garb of grey, wrapt in which it goes about its laboursduring the long winter.  Its endless buildings look grey, its skyand its streets assume a sombre hue; the scattered, leaflesstrees and wind-blown dust and paper but add to the generalsolemnity of colour.  There seems to be something in the chillbreezes which scurry through the long, narrow thoroughfaresproductive of rueful thoughts.  Not poets alone, nor artists, northat superior order of mind which arrogates to itself allrefinement, feel this, but dogs and all men.  These feel as muchas the poet, though they have not the same power of expression.The sparrow upon the wire, the cat in the doorway, the dray horsetugging his weary load, feel the long, keen breaths of winter.It strikes to the heart of all life, animate and inanimate.  Ifit were not for the artificial fires of merriment, the rush ofprofit-seeking trade, and pleasure-selling amusements; if thevarious merchants failed to make the customary display within andwithout their establishments; if our streets were not strung withsigns of gorgeous hues and thronged with hurrying purchasers, wewould quickly discover how firmly the chill hand of winter laysupon the heart; how dispiriting are the days during which the sunwithholds a portion of our allowance of light and warmth.  We aremore dependent upon these things than is often thought.  We areinsects produced by heat, and pass without it.
　　In the drag of such a grey day the secret voice would reassertitself, feebly and more feebly.
　　Such mental conflict was not always uppermost.  Carrie was not byany means a gloomy soul.  More, she had not the mind to get firmhold upon a definite truth.  When she could not find her way outof the labyrinth of ill-logic which thought upon the subjectcreated, she would turn away entirely.
　　Drouet, all the time, was conducting himself in a model way forone of his sort.  He took her about a great deal, spent moneyupon her, and when he travelled took her with him.  There weretimes when she would be alone for two or three days, while hemade the shorter circuits of his business, but, as a rule, shesaw a great deal of him.
　　"Say, Carrie," he said one morning, shortly after they had soestablished themselves, "I've invited my friend Hurstwood to comeout some day and spend the evening with us."
　　"Who is he?" asked Carrie.  doubtfully.
　　"Oh, he's a nice man.  He's manager of Fitzgerald and Moy's."
　　"What's that?" said Carrie.
　　"The finest resort in town.  It's a way-up, swell place."
　　Carrie puzzled a moment.  She was wondering what Drouet had toldhim, what her attitude would be.
　　"That's all right," said Drouet, feeling her thought. "He doesn'tknow anything.  You're Mrs. Drouet now."
　　There was something about this which struck Carrie as slightlyinconsiderate.  She could see that Drouet did not have thekeenest sensibilities.
　　"Why don't we get married?" she inquired, thinking of the volublepromises he had made.
　　"Well, we will," he said, "just as soon as I get this little dealof mine closed up."
　　He was referring to some property which he said he had, and whichrequired so much attention, adjustment, and what not, thatsomehow or other it interfered with his free moral, personalactions.
　　"Just as soon as I get back from my Denver trip in January we'lldo it."
　　Carrie accepted this as basis for hope--it was a sort of salve toher conscience, a pleasant way out.  Under the circumstances,things would be righted.  Her actions would be justified.She really was not enamoured of Drouet.  She was more clever thanhe.  In a dim way, she was beginning to see where he lacked.  Ifit had not been for this, if she had not been able to measure andjudge him in a way, she would have been worse off than she was.She would have adored him.  She would have been utterly wretchedin her fear of not gaining his affection, of losing his interest,of being swept away and left without an anchorage.  As it was,she wavered a little, slightly anxious, at first, to gain himcompletely, but later feeling at ease in waiting.  She was notexactly sure what she thought of him--what she wanted to do.
　　When Hurstwood called, she met a man who was more clever thanDrouet in a hundred ways.  He paid that peculiar deference towomen which every member of the sex appreciates.  He was notoverawed, he was not overbold.  His great charm wasattentiveness.  Schooled in winning those birds of fine featheramong his own sex, the merchants and professionals who visitedhis resort, he could use even greater tact when endeavouring toprove agreeable to some one who charmed him.  In a pretty womanof any refinement of feeling whatsoever he found his greatestincentive.  He was mild, placid, assured, giving the impressionthat he wished to be of service only--to do something which wouldmake the lady more pleased.
　　Drouet had ability in this line himself when the game was worththe candle, but he was too much the egotist to reach the polishwhich Hurstwood possessed.  He was too buoyant, too full of ruddylife, too assured.  He succeeded with many who were not quiteschooled in the art of love.  He failed dismally where the womanwas slightly experienced and possessed innate refinement. In thecase of Carrie he found a woman who was all of the latter, butnone of the former.  He was lucky in the fact that opportunitytumbled into his lap, as it were.  A few years later, with alittle more experience, the slightest tide of success, and he hadnot been able to approach Carrie at all.
　　"You ought to have a piano here, Drouet," said Hurstwood, smilingat Carrie, on the evening in question, "so that your wife couldplay."
　　Drouet had not thought of that.
　　"So we ought," he observed readily.
　　"Oh, I don't play," ventured Carrie.
　　"It isn't very difficult," returned Hurstwood.  "You could dovery well in a few weeks."
　　He was in the best form for entertaining this evening. Hisclothes were particularly new and rich in appearance.  The coatlapels stood out with that medium stiffness which excellent clothpossesses.  The vest was of a rich Scotch plaid, set with adouble row of round mother-of-pearl buttons.  His cravat was ashiny combination of silken threads, not loud, not inconspicuous.What he wore did not strike the eye so forcibly as that whichDrouet had on, but Carrie could see the elegance of the material.Hurstwood's shoes were of soft, black calf, polished only to adull shine.  Drouet wore patent leather but Carrie could not helpfeeling that there was a distinction in favour of the softleather, where all else was so rich.  She noticed these thingsalmost unconsciously.  They were things which would naturallyflow from the situation. She was used to Drouet's appearance.
　　"Suppose we have a little game of euchre?" suggested Hurstwood,after a light round of conversation.  He was rather dexterous inavoiding everything that would suggest that he knew anything ofCarrie's past.  He kept away from personalities altogether, andconfined himself to those things which did not concernindividuals at all.  By his manner, he put Carrie at her ease,and by his deference and pleasantries he amused her.  Hepretended to be seriously interested in all she said.
　　"I don't know how to play," said Carrie.
　　"Charlie, you are neglecting a part of your duty," he observed toDrouet most affably.  "Between us, though," he went on, "we canshow you."
　　By his tact he made Drouet feel that he admired his choice.There was something in his manner that showed that he was pleasedto be there.  Drouet felt really closer to him than ever before.It gave him more respect for Carrie.  Her appearance came into anew light, under Hurstwood's appreciation.  The situation livenedconsiderably.
　　"Now, let me see," said Hurstwood, looking over Carrie's shouldervery deferentially.  "What have you?" He studied for a moment."That's rather good," he said.
　　"You're lucky.  Now, I'll show you how to trounce your husband.You take my advice."
　　"Here," said Drouet, "if you two are going to scheme together, Iwon't stand a ghost of a show.  Hurstwood's a regular sharp."
　　"No, it's your wife.  She brings me luck.  Why shouldn't shewin?"
　　Carrie looked gratefully at Hurstwood, and smiled at Drouet.  Theformer took the air of a mere friend.  He was simply there toenjoy himself.  Anything that Carrie did was pleasing to him,nothing more.
　　"There," he said, holding back one of his own good cards, andgiving Carrie a chance to take a trick.  "I count that cleverplaying for a beginner."
　　The latter laughed gleefully as she saw the hand coming her way.It was as if she were invincible when Hurstwood helped her.
　　He did not look at her often.  When he did, it was with a mildlight in his eye.  Not a shade was there of anything savegeniality and kindness.  He took back the shifty, clever gleam,and replaced it with one of innocence.  Carrie could not guessbut that it was pleasure with him in the immediate thing.  Shefelt that he considered she was doing a great deal.
　　"It's unfair to let such playing go without earning something,"he said after a time, slipping his finger into the little coinpocket of his coat.  "Let's play for dimes."
　　"All right," said Drouet, fishing for bills.
　　Hurstwood was quicker.  His fingers were full of new ten-centpieces.  "Here we are," he said, supplying each one with a littlestack.
　　"Oh, this is gambling," smiled Carrie.  "It's bad."
　　"No," said Drouet, "only fun.  If you never play for more thanthat, you will go to Heaven."
　　"Don't you moralise," said Hurstwood to Carrie gently, "until yousee what becomes of the money."
　　Drouet smiled.
　　"If your husband gets them, he'll tell you how bad it is."
　　Drouet laughed loud.
　　There was such an ingratiating tone about Hurstwood's voice, theinsinuation was so perceptible that even Carrie got the humour ofit.
　　"When do you leave?" said Hurstwood to Drouet.
　　"On Wednesday," he replied.
　　"It's rather hard to have your husband running about like that,isn't it?" said Hurstwood, addressing Carrie.
　　"She's going along with me this time," said Drouet.
　　"You must both go with me to the theatre before you go."
　　"Certainly," said Drouet.  "Eh, Carrie?"
　　"I'd like it ever so much," she replied.
　　Hurstwood did his best to see that Carrie won the money.  Herejoiced in her success, kept counting her winnings, and finallygathered and put them in her extended hand.  They spread a littlelunch, at which he served the wine, and afterwards he used finetact in going.
　　"Now," he said, addressing first Carrie and then Drouet with hiseyes, "you must be ready at 7.30.  I'll come and get you."
　　They went with him to the door and there was his cab waiting, itsred lamps gleaming cheerfully in the shadow.
　　"Now," he observed to Drouet, with a tone of good-fellowship,"when you leave your wife alone, you must let me show her arounda little.  It will break up her loneliness."
　　"Sure," said Drouet, quite pleased at the attention shown.
　　"You're so kind," observed Carrie.
　　"Not at all," said Hurstwood, "I would want your husband to do asmuch for me."
　　He smiled and went lightly away.  Carrie was thoroughlyimpressed.  She had never come in contact with such grace.  Asfor Drouet, he was equally pleased.
　　"There's a nice man," he remarked to Carrie, as they returned totheir cosey chamber.  "A good friend of mine, too."
　　"He seems to be," said Carrie.
　　Chapter XI
　　THE PERSUASION OF FASHION--FEELING GUARDS O'ER ITS OWN
　　Carrie was an apt student of fortune's ways--of fortune'ssuperficialities.  Seeing a thing, she would immediately set toinquiring how she would look, properly related to it.  Be itknown that this is not fine feeling, it is not wisdom.  Thegreatest minds are not so afflicted; and on the contrary, thelowest order of mind is not so disturbed.  Fine clothes to herwere a vast persuasion; they spoke tenderly and Jesuitically forthemselves.  When she came within earshot of their pleading,desire in her bent a willing ear.  The voice of the so-calledinanimate!  Who shall translate for us the language of thestones?
　　"My dear," said the lace collar she secured from Partridge's, "Ifit you beautifully; don't give me up."
　　"Ah, such little feet," said the leather of the soft new shoes;"how effectively I cover them.  What a pity they should ever wantmy aid."
　　Once these things were in her hand, on her person, she mightdream of giving them up; the method by which they came mightintrude itself so forcibly that she would ache to be rid of thethought of it, but she would not give them up.  "Put on the oldclothes--that torn pair of shoes," was called to her by herconscience in vain.  She could possibly have conquered the fearof hunger and gone back; the thought of hard work and a narrowround of suffering would, under the last pressure of conscience,have yielded, but spoil her appearance?--be old-clothed and poor-appearing?--never!
　　Drouet heightened her opinion on this and allied subjects in sucha manner as to weaken her power of resisting their influence.  Itis so easy to do this when the thing opined is in the line ofwhat we desire. In his hearty way, he insisted upon her goodlooks.  He looked at her admiringly, and she took it at its fullvalue.  Under the circumstances, she did not need to carryherself as pretty women do.  She picked that knowledge up fastenough for herself.  Drouet had a habit, characteristic of hiskind, of looking after stylishly dressed or pretty women on thestreet and remarking upon them.  He had just enough of thefeminine love of dress to be a good judge--not of intellect, butof clothes.  He saw how they set their little feet, how theycarried their chins, with what grace and sinuosity they swungtheir bodies.  A dainty, self-conscious swaying of the hips by awoman was to him as alluring as the glint of rare wine to atoper.  He would turn and follow the disappearing vision with hiseyes.  He would thrill as a child with the unhindered passionthat was in him.  He loved the thing that women love inthemselves, grace.  At this, their own shrine, he knelt withthem, an ardent devotee.
　　"Did you see that woman who went by just now?" he said to Carrieon the first day they took a walk together. "Fine stepper, wasn'tshe?"
　　Carrie looked, and observed the grace commended.
　　"Yes, she is," she returned, cheerfully, a little suggestion ofpossible defect in herself awakening in her mind.  If that was sofine, she must look at it more closely.  Instinctively, she felta desire to imitate it.  Surely she could do that too.
　　When one of her mind sees many things emphasized and re-emphasized and admired, she gathers the logic of it and appliesaccordingly.  Drouet was not shrewd enough to see that this wasnot tactful.  He could not see that it would be better to makeher feel that she was competing with herself, not others betterthan herself. He would not have done it with an older, wiserwoman, but in Carrie he saw only the novice.  Less clever thanshe, he was naturally unable to comprehend her sensibility.  Hewent on educating and wounding her, a thing rather foolish in onewhose admiration for his pupil and victim was apt to grow.
　　Carrie took the instructions affably.  She saw what Drouet liked;in a vague way she saw where he was weak. It lessens a woman'sopinion of a man when she learns that his admiration is sopointedly and generously distributed.  She sees but one object ofsupreme compliment in this world, and that is herself.  If a manis to succeed with many women, he must be all in all to each.
　　In her own apartments Carrie saw things which were lessons in thesame school.
　　In the same house with her lived an official of one of thetheatres, Mr. Frank A. Hale, manager of the Standard, and hiswife, a pleasing-looking brunette of thirty-five.  They werepeople of a sort very common in America today, who liverespectably from hand to mouth.  Hale received a salary of forty-five dollars a week.  His wife, quite attractive, affected thefeeling of youth, and objected to that sort of home life whichmeans the care of a house and the raising of a family.  LikeDrouet and Carrie, they also occupied three rooms on the floorabove.
　　Not long after she arrived Mrs. Hale established social relationswith her, and together they went about.  For a long time this washer only companionship, and the gossip of the manager's wifeformed the medium through which she saw the world.  Suchtrivialities, such praises of wealth, such conventionalexpression of morals as sifted through this passive creature'smind, fell upon Carrie and for the while confused her.
　　On the other hand, her own feelings were a corrective influence.The constant drag to something better was not to be denied.  Bythose things which address the heart was she steadily recalled.In the apartments across the hall were a young girl and hermother.  They were from Evansville, Indiana, the wife anddaughter of a railroad treasurer.  The daughter was here to studymusic, the mother to keep her company.
　　Carrie did not make their acquaintance, but she saw the daughtercoming in and going out.  A few times she had seen her at thepiano in the parlour, and not infrequently had heard her play.This young woman was particularly dressy for her station, andwore a jewelled ring or two which flashed upon her white fingersas she played.
　　Now Carrie was affected by music.  Her nervous compositionresponded to certain strains, much as certain strings of a harpvibrate when a corresponding key of a piano is struck.  She wasdelicately moulded in sentiment, and answered with vagueruminations to certain wistful chords.  They awoke longings forthose things which she did not have.  They caused her to clingcloser to things she possessed.  One short song the young ladyplayed in a most soulful and tender mood.  Carrie heard itthrough the open door from the parlour below.  It was at thathour between afternoon and night when, for the idle, thewanderer, things are apt to take on a wistful aspect.  The mindwanders forth on far journeys and returns with sheaves ofwithered and departed joys.  Carrie sat at her window lookingout.  Drouet had been away since ten in the morning.  She hadamused herself with a walk, a book by Bertha M. Clay which Drouethad left there, though she did not wholly enjoy the latter, andby changing her dress for the evening.  Now she sat looking outacross the park as wistful and depressed as the nature whichcraves variety and life can be under such circumstances.  As shecontemplated her new state, the strain from the parlour belowstole upward.  With it her thoughts became coloured and enmeshed.She reverted to the things which were best and saddest within thesmall limit of her experience.  She became for the moment arepentant.
　　While she was in this mood Drouet came in, bringing with him anentirely different atmosphere.  It was dusk and Carrie had
　　neglected to light the lamp.  The fire in the grate, too, hadburned low.
　　"Where are you, Cad?" he said, using a pet name he had given her.
　　"Here," she answered.
　　There was something delicate and lonely in her voice, but hecould not hear it.  He had not the poetry in him that would seeka woman out under such circumstances and console her for thetragedy of life.  Instead, he struck a match and lighted the gas.
　　"Hello," he exclaimed, "you've been crying."
　　Her eyes were still wet with a few vague tears.
　　"Pshaw," he said, "you don't want to do that."
　　He took her hand, feeling in his good-natured egotism that it wasprobably lack of his presence which had made her lonely.
　　"Come on, now," he went on; "it's all right.  Let's waltz alittle to that music."
　　He could not have introduced a more incongruous proposition.  Itmade clear to Carrie that he could not sympathise with her.  Shecould not have framed thoughts which would have expressed hisdefect or made clear the difference between them, but she feltit.  It was his first great mistake.
　　What Drouet said about the girl's grace, as she tripped outevenings accompanied by her mother, caused Carrie to perceive thenature and value of those little modish ways which women adoptwhen they would presume to be something.  She looked in themirror and pursed up her lips, accompanying it with a little tossof the head, as she had seen the railroad treasurer's daughterdo.  She caught up her skirts with an easy swing, for had notDrouet remarked that in her and several others, and Carrie wasnaturally imitative.  She began to get the hang of those littlethings which the pretty woman who has vanity invariably adopts.In short, her knowledge of grace doubled, and with it herappearance changed.  She became a girl of considerable taste.
　　Drouet noticed this.  He saw the new bow in her hair and the newway of arranging her locks which she affected one morning.
　　"You look fine that way, Cad," he said.
　　"Do I?" she replied, sweetly.  It made her try for other effectsthat selfsame day.
　　She used her feet less heavily, a thing that was brought about byher attempting to imitate the treasurer's daughter's gracefulcarriage.  How much influence the presence of that young woman inthe same house had upon her it would be difficult to say.  But,because of all these things, when Hurstwood called he had found ayoung woman who was much more than the Carrie to whom Drouet hadfirst spoken.  The primary defects of dress and manner hadpassed.  She was pretty, graceful, rich in the timidity born ofuncertainty, and with a something childlike in her large eyeswhich captured the fancy of this starched and conventional poseramong men.  It was the ancient attraction of the fresh for thestale.  If there was a touch of appreciation left in him for thebloom and unsophistication which is the charm of youth, itrekindled now.  He looked into her pretty face and felt thesubtle waves of young life radiating therefrom.  In that largeclear eye he could see nothing that his blase nature couldunderstand as guile.  The little vanity, if he could haveperceived it there, would have touched him as a pleasant thing.
　　"I wonder," he said, as he rode away in his cab, "how Drouet cameto win her."
　　He gave her credit for feelings superior to Drouet at the firstglance.
　　The cab plopped along between the far-receding lines of gas lampson either hand.  He folded his gloved hands and saw only thelighted chamber and Carrie's face.  He was pondering over thedelight of youthful beauty.
　　"I'll have a bouquet for her," he thought.  "Drouet won't mind."He never for a moment concealed the fact of her attraction forhimself.  He troubled himself not at all about Drouet's priority.He was merely floating those gossamer threads of thought which,like the spider's, he hoped would lay hold somewhere.  He did notknow, he could not guess, what the result would be.
　　A few weeks later Drouet, in his peregrinations, encountered oneof his well-dressed lady acquaintances in Chicago on his returnfrom a short trip to Omaha.  He had intended to hurry out toOgden Place and surprise Carrie, but now he fell into aninteresting conversation and soon modified his originalintention.
　　"Let's go to dinner," he said, little recking any chance meetingwhich might trouble his way.
　　"Certainly," said his companion.
　　They visited one of the better restaurants for a social chat.  Itwas five in the afternoon when they met; it was seven-thirtybefore the last bone was picked.
　　Drouet was just finishing a little incident he was relating, andhis face was expanding into a smile, when Hurstwood's eye caughthis own.  The latter had come in with several friends, and,seeing Drouet and some woman, not Carrie, drew his ownconclusion.
　　"Ah, the rascal," he thought, and then, with a touch of righteoussympathy, "that's pretty hard on the little girl."
　　Drouet jumped from one easy thought to another as he caughtHurstwood's eye.  He felt but very little misgiving, until he sawthat Hurstwood was cautiously pretending not to see.  Then someof the latter's impression forced itself upon him.  He thought ofCarrie and their last meeting.  By George, he would have toexplain this to Hurstwood.  Such a chance half-hour with an oldfriend must not have anything more attached to it than it reallywarranted.
　　For the first time he was troubled.  Here was a moralcomplication of which he could not possibly get the ends.Hurstwood would laugh at him for being a fickle boy.  He wouldlaugh with Hurstwood.  Carrie would never hear, his presentcompanion at table would never know, and yet he could not helpfeeling that he was getting the worst of it--there was some faintstigma attached, and he was not guilty.  He broke up the dinnerby becoming dull, and saw his companion on her car.  Then he wenthome.
　　"He hasn't talked to me about any of these later flames," thoughtHurstwood to himself.  "He thinks I think he cares for the girlout there."
　　"He ought not to think I'm knocking around, since I have justintroduced him out there," thought Drouet.
　　"I saw you," Hurstwood said, genially, the next time Drouetdrifted in to his polished resort, from which he could not stayaway.  He raised his forefinger indicatively, as parents do tochildren.
　　"An old acquaintance of mine that I ran into just as I was comingup from the station," explained Drouet.  "She used to be quite abeauty."
　　"Still attracts a little, eh?" returned the other, affecting tojest.
　　"Oh, no," said Drouet, "just couldn't escape her this time."
　　"How long are you here?" asked Hurstwood.
　　"Only a few days."
　　"You must bring the girl down and take dinner with me," he said."I'm afraid you keep her cooped up out there.  I'll get a box forJoe Jefferson."
　　"Not me," answered the drummer.  "Sure I'll come."
　　This pleased Hurstwood immensely.  He gave Drouet no credit forany feelings toward Carrie whatever.  He envied him, and now, ashe looked at the well-dressed jolly salesman, whom he so muchliked, the gleam of the rival glowed in his eye.  He began to"size up" Drouet from the standpoints of wit and fascination.  Hebegan to look to see where he was weak.  There was no disputingthat, whatever he might think of him as a good fellow, he felt acertain amount of contempt for him as a lover.  He could hoodwinkhim all right.  Why, if he would just let Carrie see one suchlittle incident as that of Thursday, it would settle the matter.He ran on in thought, almost exulting, the while he laughed andchatted, and Drouet felt nothing.  He had no power of analysingthe glance and the atmosphere of a man like Hurstwood.  He stoodand smiled and accepted the invitation while his friend examinedhim with the eye of a hawk.
　　The object of this peculiarly involved comedy was not thinking ofeither.  She was busy adjusting her thoughts and feelings tonewer conditions, and was not in danger of suffering disturbingpangs from either quarter.One evening Drouet found her dressing herself before the glass.
　　"Cad," said he, catching her, "I believe you're getting vain."
　　"Nothing of the kind," she returned, smiling.
　　"Well, you're mighty pretty," he went on, slipping his arm aroundher.  "Put on that navy-blue dress of yours and I'll take you tothe show."
　　"Oh, I've promised Mrs. Hale to go with her to the Exposition to-night," she returned, apologetically.
　　"You did, eh?" he said, studying the situation abstractedly.  "Iwouldn't care to go to that myself."
　　"Well, I don't know," answered Carrie, puzzling, but not offeringto break her promise in his favour.
　　Just then a knock came at their door and the maidservant handed aletter in.
　　"He says there's an answer expected," she explained.
　　"It's from Hurstwood," said Drouet, noting the superscription ashe tore it open.
　　"You are to come down and see Joe Jefferson with me to-night," itran in part.  "It's my turn, as we agreed the other day.  Allother bets are off."
　　"Well, what do you say to this?" asked Drouet, innocently, whileCarrie's mind bubbled with favourable replies.
　　"You had better decide, Charlie," she said, reservedly.
　　"I guess we had better go, if you can break that engagementupstairs," said Drouet.
　　"Oh, I can," returned Carrie without thinking.
　　Drouet selected writing paper while Carrie went to change herdress.  She hardly explained to herself why this latestinvitation appealed to her most
　　"Shall I wear my hair as I did yesterday?" she asked, as she cameout with several articles of apparel pending.
　　"Sure," he returned, pleasantly.
　　She was relieved to see that he felt nothing.  She did not credither willingness to go to any fascination Hurstwood held for her.It seemed that the combination of Hurstwood, Drouet, and herselfwas more agreeable than anything else that had been suggested.She arrayed herself most carefully and they started off,extending excuses upstairs.
　　"I say," said Hurstwood, as they came up the theatre lobby, "weare exceedingly charming this evening."
　　Carrie fluttered under his approving glance.
　　"Now, then," he said, leading the way up the foyer into thetheatre.
　　If ever there was dressiness it was here.  It was thepersonification of the old term spick and span.
　　"Did you ever see Jefferson?" he questioned, as he leaned towardCarrie in the box.
　　"I never did," she returned.
　　"He's delightful, delightful," he went on, giving the commonplacerendition of approval which such men know.  He sent Drouet aftera programme, and then discoursed to Carrie concerning Jeffersonas he had heard of him.  The former was pleased beyondexpression, and was really hypnotised by the environment, thetrappings of the box, the elegance of her companion.  Severaltimes their eyes accidentally met, and then there poured intohers such a flood of feeling as she had never before experienced.She could not for the moment explain it, for in the next glanceor the next move of the hand there was seeming indifference,mingled only with the kindest attention.
　　Drouet shared in the conversation, but he was almost dull incomparison.  Hurstwood entertained them both, and now it wasdriven into Carrie's mind that here was the superior man.  Sheinstinctively felt that he was stronger and higher, and yetwithal so simple.  By the end of the third act she was sure thatDrouet was only a kindly soul, but otherwise defective.  He sankevery moment in her estimation by the strong comparison.
　　"I have had such a nice time," said Carrie, when it was all overand they were coming out.
　　"Yes, indeed," added Drouet, who was not in the least aware thata battle had been fought and his defences weakened.  He was likethe Emperor of China, who sat glorying in himself, unaware thathis fairest provinces were being wrested from him.
　　"Well, you have saved me a dreary evening," returned Hurstwood."Good-night."
　　He took Carrie's little hand, and a current of feeling swept fromone to the other.
　　"I'm so tired," said Carrie, leaning back in the car when Drouetbegan to talk.
　　"Well, you rest a little while I smoke," he said, rising, andthen he foolishly went to the forward platform of the car andleft the game as it stood.
　　Chapter XII
　　OF THE LAMPS OF THE MANSIONS--THE AMBASSADOR PLEA
　　Mrs. Hurstwood was not aware of any of her husband's moraldefections, though she might readily have suspected histendencies, which she well understood.  She was a woman uponwhose action under provocation you could never count.  Hurstwood,for one, had not the slightest idea of what she would do undercertain circumstances.  He had never seen her thoroughly aroused.In fact, she was not a woman who would fly into a passion.  Shehad too little faith in mankind not to know that they wereerring.  She was too calculating to jeopardize any advantage shemight gain in the way of information by fruitless clamour.  Herwrath would never wreak itself in one fell blow.  She would waitand brood, studying the details and adding to them until herpower might be commensurate with her desire for revenge.  At thesame time, she would not delay to inflict any injury, big orlittle, which would wound the object of her revenge and stillleave him uncertain as to the source of the evil.  She was acold, self-centred woman, with many a thought of her own whichnever found expression, not even by so much as the glint of aneye.
　　Hurstwood felt some of this in her nature, though he did notactually perceive it.  He dwelt with her in peace and somesatisfaction.  He did not fear her in the least--there was nocause for it.  She still took a faint pride in him, which wasaugmented by her desire to have her social integrity maintained.She was secretly somewhat pleased by the fact that much of herhusband's property was in her name, a precaution which Hurstwoodhad taken when his home interests were somewhat more alluringthan at present.  His wife had not the slightest reason to feelthat anything would ever go amiss with their household, and yetthe shadows which run before gave her a thought of the good of itnow and then.  She was in a position to become refractory withconsiderable advantage, and Hurstwood conducted himselfcircumspectly because he felt that he could not be sure ofanything once she became dissatisfied.
　　It so happened that on the night when Hurstwood, Carrie, andDrouet were in the box at McVickar's, George, Jr., was in thesixth row of the parquet with the daughter of H. B. Carmichael,the third partner of a wholesale dry-goods house of that city.Hurstwood did not see his son, for he sat, as was his wont, asfar back as possible, leaving himself just partially visible,when he bent forward, to those within the first six rows inquestion.  It was his wont to sit this way in every theatre--tomake his personality as inconspicuous as possible where it wouldbe no advantage to him to have it otherwise.
　　He never moved but what, if there was any danger of his conductbeing misconstrued or ill-reported, he looked carefully about himand counted the cost of every inch of conspicuity.
　　The next morning at breakfast his son said:
　　"I saw you, Governor, last night."
　　"Were you at McVickar's?" said Hurstwood, with the best grace inthe world.
　　"Yes," said young George.
　　"Who with?"
　　"Miss Carmichael."
　　Mrs. Hurstwood directed an inquiring glance at her husband, butcould not judge from his appearance whether it was any more thana casual look into the theatre which was referred to.
　　"How was the play?" she inquired.
　　"Very good," returned Hurstwood, "only it's the same old thing,'Rip Van Winkle.'"
　　"Whom did you go with?" queried his wife, with assumedindifference.
　　"Charlie Drouet and his wife.  They are friends of Moy's,visiting here."
　　Owing to the peculiar nature of his position, such a disclosureas this would ordinarily create no difficulty.  His wife took itfor granted that his situation called for certain socialmovements in which she might not be included.  But of late he hadpleaded office duty on several occasions when his wife asked forhis company to any evening entertainment.  He had done so inregard to the very evening in question only the morning before.
　　"I thought you were going to be busy," she remarked, verycarefully.
　　"So I was," he exclaimed.  "I couldn't help the interruption, butI made up for it afterward by working until two."
　　This settled the discussion for the time being, but there was aresidue of opinion which was not satisfactory.  There was no timeat which the claims of his wife could have been moreunsatisfactorily pushed.  For years he had been steadilymodifying his matrimonial devotion, and found her company dull.Now that a new light shone upon the horizon, this older luminarypaled in the west.  He was satisfied to turn his face awayentirely, and any call to look back was irksome.
　　She, on the contrary, was not at all inclined to accept anythingless than a complete fulfilment of the letter of theirrelationship, though the spirit might be wanting.
　　"We are coming down town this afternoon," she remarked, a fewdays later.  "I want you to come over to Kinsley's and meet Mr.Phillips and his wife.  They're stopping at the Tremont, andwe're going to show them around a little."
　　After the occurrence of Wednesday, he could not refuse, thoughthe Phillips were about as uninteresting as vanity and ignorancecould make them.  He agreed, but it was with short grace.  He wasangry when he left the house.
　　"I'll put a stop to this," he thought.  "I'm not going to bebothered fooling around with visitors when I have work to do."
　　Not long after this Mrs. Hurstwood came with a similarproposition, only it was to a matinee this time.
　　"My dear," he returned, "I haven't time.  I'm too busy."
　　"You find time to go with other people, though," she replied,with considerable irritation.
　　"Nothing of the kind," he answered.  "I can't avoid businessrelations, and that's all there is to it."
　　"Well, never mind," she exclaimed.  Her lips tightened.  Thefeeling of mutual antagonism was increased.
　　On the other hand, his interest in Drouet's little shop-girl grewin an almost evenly balanced proportion.  That young lady, underthe stress of her situation and the tutelage of her new friend,changed effectively.  She had the aptitude of the struggler whoseeks emancipation.  The glow of a more showy life was not lostupon her.  She did not grow in knowledge so much as she awakenedin the matter of desire.  Mrs. Hale's extended harangues upon thesubjects of wealth and position taught her to distinguish betweendegrees of wealth.Mrs. Hale loved to drive in the afternoon in the sun when it wasfine, and to satisfy her soul with a sight of those mansions andlawns which she could not afford.  On the North Side had beenerected a number of elegant mansions along what is now known asthe North Shore Drive.  The present lake wall of stone andgranitoid was not then in place, but the road had been well laidout, the intermediate spaces of lawn were lovely to look upon,and the houses were thoroughly new and imposing.  When the winterseason had passed and the first fine days of the early springappeared, Mrs. Hale secured a buggy for an afternoon and invitedCarrie.  They rode first through Lincoln Park and on far outtowards Evanston, turning back at four and arriving at the northend of the Shore Drive at about five o'clock.  At this time ofyear the days are still comparatively short, and the shadows ofthe evening were beginning to settle down upon the great city.Lamps were beginning to burn with that mellow radiance whichseems almost watery and translucent to the eye.  There was asoftness in the air which speaks with an infinite delicacy offeeling to the flesh as well as to the soul.  Carrie felt that itwas a lovely day.  She was ripened by it in spirit for manysuggestions.  As they drove along the smooth pavement anoccasional carriage passed.  She saw one stop and the footmandismount, opening the door for a gentleman who seemed to beleisurely returning from some afternoon pleasure.  Across thebroad lawns, now first freshening into green, she saw lampsfaintly glowing upon rich interiors.  Now it was but a chair, nowa table, now an ornate corner, which met her eye, but it appealedto her as almost nothing else could.  Such childish fancies asshe had had of fairy palaces and kingly quarters now came back.She imagined that across these richly carved entrance-ways, wherethe globed and crystalled lamps shone upon panelled doors setwith stained and designed panes of glass, was neither care norunsatisfied desire.  She was perfectly certain that here washappiness.  If she could but stroll up yon broad walk, cross thatrich entrance-way, which to her was of the beauty of a jewel, andsweep in grace and luxury to possession and command--oh! howquickly would sadness flee; how, in an instant, would theheartache end.  She gazed and gazed, wondering, delighting,longing, and all the while the siren voice of the unrestful waswhispering in her ear.
　　"If we could have such a home as that," said Mrs. Hale sadly,"how delightful it would be."
　　"And yet they do say," said Carrie, "that no one is ever happy."
　　She had heard so much of the canting philosophy of the grapelessfox.
　　"I notice," said Mrs. Hale, "that they all try mighty hard,though, to take their misery in a mansion."
　　When she came to her own rooms, Carrie saw their comparativeinsignificance.  She was not so dull but that she could perceivethey were but three small rooms in a moderately well-furnishedboarding-house.  She was not contrasting it now with what she hadhad, but what she had so recently seen.  The glow of the palatialdoors was still in her eye, the roll of cushioned carriages stillin her ears.  What, after all, was Drouet?  What was she?  At herwindow, she thought it over, rocking to and fro, and gazing outacross the lamp-lit park toward the lamp-lit houses on Warren andAshland avenues.  She was too wrought up to care to go down toeat, too pensive to do aught but rock and sing.  Some old tunescrept to her lips, and, as she sang them, her heart sank.  Shelonged and longed and longed.  It was now for the old cottageroom in Columbia City, now the mansion upon the Shore Drive, nowthe fine dress of some lady, now the elegance of some scene.  Shewas sad beyond measure, and yet uncertain, wishing, fancying.Finally, it seemed as if all her state was one of loneliness andforsakenness, and she could scarce refrain from trembling at thelip.  She hummed and hummed as the moments went by, sitting inthe shadow by the window, and was therein as happy, though shedid not perceive it, as she ever would be.
　　While Carrie was still in this frame of mind, the house-servantbrought up the intelligence that Mr. Hurstwood was in the parlourasking to see Mr. and Mrs. Drouet.
　　"I guess he doesn't know that Charlie is out of town," thoughtCarrie.
　　She had seen comparatively little of the manager during thewinter, but had been kept constantly in mind of him by one thingand another, principally by the strong impression he had made.She was quite disturbed for the moment as to her appearance, butsoon satisfied herself by the aid of the mirror, and went below.
　　Hurstwood was in his best form, as usual.  He hadn't heard thatDrouet was out of town.  He was but slightly affected by theintelligence, and devoted himself to the more general topicswhich would interest Carrie.  It was surprising--the ease withwhich he conducted a conversation.  He was like every man who hashad the advantage of practice and knows he has sympathy.  He knewthat Carrie listened to him pleasurably, and, without the leasteffort, he fell into a train of observation which absorbed herfancy.  He drew up his chair and modulated his voice to such adegree that what he said seemed wholly confidential.  He confinedhimself almost exclusively to his observation of men andpleasures.  He had been here and there, he had seen this andthat.  Somehow he made Carrie wish to see similar things, and allthe while kept her aware of himself.  She could not shut out theconsciousness of his individuality and presence for a moment.  Hewould raise his eyes slowly in smiling emphasis of something, andshe was fixed by their magnetism.  He would draw out, with theeasiest grace, her approval.  Once he touched her hand foremphasis and she only smiled.  He seemed to radiate an atmospherewhich suffused her being.  He was never dull for a minute, andseemed to make her clever.  At least, she brightened under hisinfluence until all her best side was exhibited.  She felt thatshe was more clever with him than with others.  At least, heseemed to find so much in her to applaud.  There was not theslightest touch of patronage.  Drouet was full of it.
　　There had been something so personal, so subtle, in each meetingbetween them, both when Drouet was present and when he wasabsent, that Carrie could not speak of it without feeling a senseof difficulty.  She was no talker.  She could never arrange herthoughts in fluent order.  It was always a matter of feeling withher, strong and deep.  Each time there had been no sentence ofimportance which she could relate, and as for the glances andsensations, what woman would reveal them? Such things had neverbeen between her and Drouet.  As a matter of fact, they couldnever be.  She had been dominated by distress and theenthusiastic forces of relief which Drouet represented at anopportune moment when she yielded to him.  Now she was persuadedby secret current feelings which Drouet had never understood.Hurstwood's glance was as effective as the spoken words of alover, and more.  They called for no immediate decision, andcould not be answered.
　　People in general attach too much importance to words.  They areunder the illusion that talking effects great results.  As amatter of fact, words are, as a rule, the shallowest portion ofall the argument.  They but dimly represent the great surgingfeelings and desires which lie behind.  When the distraction ofthe tongue is removed, the heart listens.
　　In this conversation she heard, instead of his words, the voicesof the things which he represented.  How suave was the counsel ofhis appearance!  How feelingly did his superior state speak foritself!  The growing desire he felt for her lay upon her spiritas a gentle hand.  She did not need to tremble at all, because itwas invisible; she did not need to worry over what other peoplewould say--what she herself would say--because it had notangibility.  She was being pleaded with, persuaded, led intodenying old rights and assuming new ones, and yet there were nowords to prove it.  Such conversation as was indulged in held thesame relationship to the actual mental enactments of the twainthat the low music of the orchestra does to the dramatic incidentwhich it is used to cover.
　　"Have you ever seen the houses along the Lake Shore on the NorthSide?" asked Hurstwood.
　　"Why, I was just over there this afternoon--Mrs. Hale and I.Aren't they beautiful?"
　　"They're very fine," he answered.
　　"Oh, me," said Carrie, pensively.  "I wish I could live in such aplace."
　　"You're not happy," said Hurstwood, slowly, after a slight pause.
　　He had raised his eyes solemnly and was looking into her own.  Heassumed that he had struck a deep chord.  Now was a slight chanceto say a word in his own behalf.  He leaned over quietly andcontinued his steady gaze.  He felt the critical character of theperiod.  She endeavoured to stir, but it was useless.  The wholestrength of a man's nature was working.  He had good cause tourge him on.  He looked and looked, and the longer the situationlasted the more difficult it became.  The little shop-girl wasgetting into deep water.  She was letting her few supports floataway from her.
　　"Oh," she said at last, "you mustn't look at me like that."
　　"I can't help it," he answered.
　　She relaxed a little and let the situation endure, giving himstrength.
　　"You are not satisfied with life, are you?"
　　"No," she answered, weakly.
　　He saw he was the master of the situation--he felt it.  Hereached over and touched her hand.
　　"You mustn't," she exclaimed, jumping up.
　　"I didn't intend to," he answered, easily.
　　She did not run away, as she might have done.  She did notterminate the interview, but he drifted off into a pleasant fieldof thought with the readiest grace.  Not long after he rose togo, and she felt that he was in power."You mustn't feel bad," he said, kindly; "things will straightenout in the course of time."
　　She made no answer, because she could think of nothing to say.
　　"We are good friends, aren't we?" he said, extending his hand.
　　"Yes," she answered.
　　"Not a word, then, until I see you again."
　　He retained a hold on her hand.
　　"I can't promise," she said, doubtfully.
　　"You must be more generous than that," he said, in such a simpleway that she was touched.
　　"Let's not talk about it any more," she returned.
　　"All right," he said, brightening.
　　He went down the steps and into his cab.  Carrie closed the doorand ascended into her room.  She undid her broad lace collarbefore the mirror and unfastened her pretty alligator belt whichshe had recently bought.
　　"I'm getting terrible," she said, honestly affected by a feelingof trouble and shame.  "I don't seem to do anything right."
　　She unloosed her hair after a time, and let it hang in loosebrown waves.  Her mind was going over the events of the evening.
　　"I don't know," she murmured at last, "what I can do."
　　"Well," said Hurstwood as he rode away, "she likes me all right;that I know."
　　The aroused manager whistled merrily for a good four miles to hisoffice an old melody that he had not recalled for fifteen years.
　　Chapter XIII
　　HIS CREDENTIALS ACCEPTED--A BABEL OF TONGUES
　　It was not quite two days after the scene between Carrie andHurstwood in the Ogden Place parlour before he again put in hisappearance.  He had been thinking almost uninterruptedly of her.Her leniency had, in a way, inflamed his regard.  He felt that hemust succeed with her, and that speedily.
　　The reason for his interest, not to say fascination, was deeperthan mere desire.  It was a flowering out of feelings which hadbeen withering in dry and almost barren soil for many years.  Itis probable that Carrie represented a better order of woman thanhad ever attracted him before.  He had had no love affair sincethat which culminated in his marriage, and since then time andthe world had taught him how raw and erroneous was his originaljudgment.  Whenever he thought of it, he told himself that, if hehad it to do over again, he would never marry such a woman.  Atthe same time, his experience with women in general had lessenedhis respect for the sex.  He maintained a cynical attitude, wellgrounded on numerous experiences.  Such women as he had knownwere of nearly one type, selfish, ignorant, flashy.  The wives ofhis friends were not inspiring to look upon.  His own wife haddeveloped a cold, commonplace nature which to him was anythingbut pleasing.  What he knew of that under-world where grovel thebeat-men of society (and he knew a great deal) had hardened hisnature.  He looked upon most women with suspicion--a single eyeto the utility of beauty and dress.  He followed them with akeen, suggestive glance.  At the same time, he was not so dullbut that a good woman commanded his respect.  Personally, he didnot attempt to analyse the marvel of a saintly woman.  He wouldtake off his hat, and would silence the light-tongued and thevicious in her presence--much as the Irish keeper of a Boweryhall will humble himself before a Sister of Mercy, and pay tollto charity with a willing and reverent hand.  But he would notthink much upon the question of why he did so.
　　A man in his situation who comes, after a long round of worthlessor hardening experiences, upon a young, unsophisticated, innocentsoul, is apt either to hold aloof, out of a sense of his ownremoteness, or to draw near and become fascinated and elated byhis discovery.  It is only by a roundabout process that such menever do draw near such a girl.  They have no method, nounderstanding of how to ingratiate themselves in youthful favour,save when they find virtue in the toils.  If, unfortunately, thefly has got caught in the net, the spider can come forth and talkbusiness upon its own terms.  So when maidenhood has wanderedinto the moil of the city, when it is brought within the circleof the "rounder" and the roue, even though it be at the outermostrim, they can come forth and use their alluring arts.
　　Hurstwood had gone, at Drouet's invitation, to meet a new baggageof fine clothes and pretty features.  He entered, expecting toindulge in an evening of lightsome frolic, and then lose track ofthe newcomer forever.  Instead he found a woman whose youth andbeauty attracted him.  In the mild light of Carrie's eye wasnothing of the calculation of the mistress.  In the diffidentmanner was nothing of the art of the courtesan.  He saw at oncethat a mistake had been made, that some difficult conditions hadpushed this troubled creature into his presence, and his interestwas enlisted.  Here sympathy sprang to the rescue, but it was notunmixed with selfishness.  He wanted to win Carrie because hethought her fate mingled with his was better than if it wereunited with Drouet's.  He envied the drummer his conquest as hehad never envied any man in all the course of his experience.
　　Carrie was certainly better than this man, as she was superior,mentally, to Drouet.  She came fresh from the air of the village,the light of the country still in her eye.  Here was neitherguile nor rapacity.  There were slight inherited traits of bothin her, but they were rudimentary.  She was too full of wonderand desire to be greedy.  She still looked about her upon thegreat maze of the city without understanding.  Hurstwood felt thebloom and the youth.  He picked her as he would the fresh fruitof a tree.  He felt as fresh in her presence as one who is takenout of the flash of summer to the first cool breath of spring.
　　Carrie, left alone since the scene in question, and having no onewith whom to counsel, had at first wandered from one strangemental conclusion to another, until at last, tired out, she gaveit up.  She owed something to Drouet, she thought.  It did notseem more than yesterday that he had aided her when she wasworried and distressed.  She had the kindliest feelings for himin every way.  She gave him credit for his good looks, hisgenerous feelings, and even, in fact, failed to recollect hisegotism when he was absent; but she could not feel any bindinginfluence keeping her for him as against all others.  In fact,such a thought had never had any grounding, even in Drouet'sdesires.
　　The truth is, that this goodly drummer carried the doom of allenduring relationships in his own lightsome manner and unstablefancy.  He went merrily on, assured that he was alluring all,that affection followed tenderly in his wake, that things wouldendure unchangingly for his pleasure.  When he missed some oldface, or found some door finally shut to him, it did not grievehim deeply.  He was too young, too successful.  He would remainthus young in spirit until he was dead.
　　As for Hurstwood, he was alive with thoughts and feelingsconcerning Carrie.  He had no definite plans regarding her, buthe was determined to make her confess an affection for him.  Hethought he saw in her drooping eye, her unstable glance, herwavering manner, the symptoms of a budding passion.  He wanted tostand near her and make her lay her hand in his--he wanted tofind out what her next step would be--what the next sign offeeling for him would be.  Such anxiety and enthusiasm had notaffected him for years.  He was a youth again in feeling--acavalier in action.
　　In his position opportunity for taking his evenings out wasexcellent.  He was a most faithful worker in general, and a manwho commanded the confidence of his employers in so far as thedistribution of his time was concerned.  He could take such hoursoff as he chose, for it was well known that he fulfilled hismanagerial duties successfully, whatever time he might take.  Hisgrace, tact, and ornate appearance gave the place an air whichwas most essential, while at the same time his long experiencemade him a most excellent judge of its stock necessities.Bartenders and assistants might come and go, singly or in groups,but, so long as he was present, the host of old-time customerswould barely notice the change.  He gave the place the atmosphereto which they were used.  Consequently, he arranged his hoursvery much to suit himself, taking now an afternoon, now anevening, but invariably returning between eleven and twelve towitness the last hour or two of the day's business and look afterthe closing details.
　　"You see that things are safe and all the employees are out whenyou go home, George," Moy had once remarked to him, and he neveronce, in all the period of his long service, neglected to dothis.  Neither of the owners had for years been in the resortafter five in the afternoon, and yet their manager as faithfullyfulfilled this request as if they had been there regularly toobserve.
　　On this Friday afternoon, scarcely two days after his previousvisit, he made up his mind to see Carrie.  He could not stay awaylonger.
　　"Evans," he said, addressing the head barkeeper, "if any onecalls, I will be back between four and five."
　　He hurried to Madison Street and boarded a horse-car, whichcarried him to Ogden Place in half an hour.
　　Carrie had thought of going for a walk, and had put on a lightgrey woollen dress with a jaunty double-breasted jacket.  She hadout her hat and gloves, and was fastening a white lace tie abouther throat when the housemaid brought up the information that Mr.Hurstwood wished to see her.
　　She started slightly at the announcement, but told the girl tosay that she would come down in a moment, and proceeded to hastenher dressing.
　　Carrie could not have told herself at this moment whether she wasglad or sorry that the impressive manager was awaiting herpresence.  She was slightly flurried and tingling in the cheeks,but it was more nervousness than either fear or favour.  She didnot try to conjecture what the drift of the conversation wouldbe.  She only felt that she must be careful, and that Hurstwoodhad an indefinable fascination for her.  Then she gave her tieits last touch with her fingers and went below.
　　The deep-feeling manager was himself a little strained in thenerves by the thorough consciousness of his mission.  He feltthat he must make a strong play on this occasion, but now thatthe hour was come, and he heard Carrie's feet upon the stair, hisnerve failed him.  He sank a little in determination, for he wasnot so sure, after all, what her opinion might be.
　　When she entered the room, however, her appearance gave himcourage.  She looked simple and charming enough to strengthen thedaring of any lover.  Her apparent nervousness dispelled his own.
　　"How are you?" he said, easily.  "I could not resist thetemptation to come out this afternoon, it was so pleasant."
　　"Yes," said Carrie, halting before him, "I was just preparing togo for a walk myself."
　　"Oh, were you?" he said.  "Supposing, then, you get your hat andwe both go?"
　　They crossed the park and went west along Washington Boulevard,beautiful with its broad macadamised road, and large frame housesset back from the sidewalks.  It was a street where many of themore prosperous residents of the West Side lived, and Hurstwoodcould not help feeling nervous over the publicity of it.  Theyhad gone but a few blocks when a livery stable sign in one of theside streets solved the difficulty for him.  He would take her todrive along the new Boulevard.
　　The Boulevard at that time was little more than a country road.The part he intended showing her was much farther out on thissame West Side, where there was scarcely a house.  It connectedDouglas Park with Washington or South Park, and was nothing morethan a neatly MADE road, running due south for some five milesover an open, grassy prairie, and then due east over the samekind of prairie for the same distance.  There was not a house tobe encountered anywhere along the larger part of the route, andany conversation would be pleasantly free of interruption.
　　At the stable he picked a gentle horse, and they were soon out ofrange of either public observation or hearing.
　　"Can you drive?" he said, after a time.
　　"I never tried," said Carrie.
　　He put the reins in her hand, and folded his arms.
　　"You see there's nothing to it much," he said, smilingly.
　　"Not when you have a gentle horse," said Carrie.
　　"You can handle a horse as well as any one, after a littlepractice," he added, encouragingly.
　　He had been looking for some time for a break in the conversationwhen he could give it a serious turn.  Once or twice he had heldhis peace, hoping that in silence her thoughts would take thecolour of his own, but she had lightly continued the subject.Presently, however, his silence controlled the situation.  Thedrift of his thoughts began to tell.  He gazed fixedly at nothingin particular, as if he were thinking of something whichconcerned her not at all.  His thoughts, however, spoke forthemselves.  She was very much aware that a climax was pending.
　　"Do you know," he said, "I have spent the happiest evenings inyears since I have known you?"
　　"Have you?" she said, with assumed airiness, but still excited bythe conviction which the tone of his voice carried.
　　"I was going to tell you the other evening," he added, "butsomehow the opportunity slipped away."
　　Carrie was listening without attempting to reply.  She couldthink of nothing worth while to say.  Despite all the ideasconcerning right which had troubled her vaguely since she hadlast seen him, she was now influenced again strongly in hisfavour.
　　"I came out here to-day," he went on, solemnly, "to tell you justhow I feel--to see if you wouldn't listen to me."
　　Hurstwood was something of a romanticist after his kind.  He wascapable of strong feelings--often poetic ones--and under a stressof desire, such as the present, he waxed eloquent.  That is, hisfeelings and his voice were coloured with that seeming repressionand pathos which is the essence of eloquence.
　　"You know," he said, putting his hand on her arm, and keeping astrange silence while he formulated words, "that I love you?"Carrie did not stir at the words.  She was bound up completely inthe man's atmosphere.  He would have churchlike silence in orderto express his feelings, and she kept it.  She did not move hereyes from the flat, open scene before her.  Hurstwood waited fora few moments, and then repeated the words.
　　"You must not say that," she said, weakly.
　　Her words were not convincing at all.  They were the result of afeeble thought that something ought to be said.  He paid noattention to them whatever.
　　"Carrie," he said, using her first name with sympatheticfamiliarity, "I want you to love me.  You don't know how much Ineed some one to waste a little affection on me.  I ampractically alone.  There is nothing in my life that is pleasantor delightful.  It's all work and worry with people who arenothing to me."
　　As he said this, Hurstwood really imagined that his state waspitiful.  He had the ability to get off at a distance and viewhimself objectively--of seeing what he wanted to see in thethings which made up his existence.  Now, as he spoke, his voicetrembled with that peculiar vibration which is the result oftensity.  It went ringing home to his companion's heart.
　　"Why, I should think," she said, turning upon him large eyeswhich were full of sympathy and feeling, "that you would be veryhappy.  You know so much of the world."
　　"That is it," he said, his voice dropping to a soft minor, "Iknow too much of the world."
　　It was an important thing to her to hear one so well-positionedand powerful speaking in this manner.  She could not help feelingthe strangeness of her situation.  How was it that, in so littlea while, the narrow life of the country had fallen from her as agarment, and the city, with all its mystery, taken its place?Here was this greatest mystery, the man of money and affairssitting beside her, appealing to her.  Behold, he had ease andcomfort, his strength was great, his position high, his clothingrich, and yet he was appealing to her.  She could formulate nothought which would be just and right.  She troubled herself nomore upon the matter.  She only basked in the warmth of hisfeeling, which was as a grateful blaze to one who is cold.Hurstwood glowed with his own intensity, and the heat of hispassion was already melting the wax of his companion's scruples.
　　"You think," he said, "I am happy; that I ought not to complain?If you were to meet all day with people who care absolutelynothing about you, if you went day after day to a place wherethere was nothing but show and indifference, if there was not oneperson in all those you knew to whom you could appeal forsympathy or talk to with pleasure, perhaps you would be unhappytoo.
　　He was striking a chord now which found sympathetic response inher own situation.  She knew what it was to meet with people whowere indifferent, to walk alone amid so many who cared absolutelynothing about you.  Had not she?  Was not she at this very momentquite alone?  Who was there among all whom she knew to whom shecould appeal for sympathy?  Not one.  She was left to herself tobrood and wonder.
　　"I could be content," went on Hurstwood, "if I had you to loveme.  If I had you to go to; you for a companion.  As it is, Isimply move about from place to place without any satisfaction.Time hangs heavily on my hands.  Before you came I did nothingbut idle and drift into anything that offered itself.  Since youcame--well, I've had you to think about."
　　The old illusion that here was some one who needed her aid beganto grow in Carrie's mind.  She truly pitied this sad, lonelyfigure.  To think that all his fine state should be so barren forwant of her; that he needed to make such an appeal when sheherself was lonely and without anchor.  Surely, this was too bad.
　　"I am not very bad," he said, apologetically, as if he owed it toher to explain on this score.  "You think, probably, that I roamaround, and get into all sorts of evil?  I have been ratherreckless, but I could easily come out of that.  I need you todraw me back, if my life ever amounts to anything."
　　Carrie looked at him with the tenderness which virtue ever feelsin its hope of reclaiming vice.  How could such a man needreclaiming?  His errors, what were they, that she could correct?Small they must be, where all was so fine.  At worst, they weregilded affairs, and with what leniency are gilded errors viewed.He put himself in such a lonely light that she was deeply moved.
　　"Is it that way?" she mused.
　　He slipped his arm about her waist, and she could not find theheart to draw away.  With his free hand he seized upon herfingers.  A breath of soft spring wind went bounding over theroad, rolling some brown twigs of the previous autumn before it.The horse paced leisurely on, unguided.
　　"Tell me," he said, softly, "that you love me."
　　Her eyes fell consciously.
　　"Own to it, dear," he said, feelingly; "you do, don't you?"
　　She made no answer, but he felt his victory.
　　"Tell me," he said, richly, drawing her so close that their lipswere near together.  He pressed her hand warmly, and thenreleased it to touch her cheek.
　　"You do?" he said, pressing his lips to her own.
　　For answer, her lips replied.
　　"Now," he said, joyously, his fine eyes ablaze, "you're my owngirl, aren't you?"
　　By way of further conclusion, her head lay softly upon hisshoulder.
　　Chapter XIV
　　WITH EYES AND NOT SEEING--ONE INFLUENCE WANES
　　Carrie in her rooms that evening was in a fine glow, physicallyand mentally.  She was deeply rejoicing in her affection forHurstwood and his love, and looked forward with fine fancy totheir next meeting Sunday night.  They had agreed, without anyfeeling of enforced secrecy, that she should come down town andmeet him, though, after all, the need of it was the cause.
　　Mrs. Hale, from her upper window, saw her come in.
　　"Um," she thought to herself, "she goes riding with another manwhen her husband is out of the city.  He had better keep an eyeon her."
　　The truth is that Mrs. Hale was not the only one who had athought on this score.  The housemaid who had welcomed Hurstwoodhad her opinion also.  She had no particular regard for Carrie,whom she took to be cold and disagreeable.  At the same time, shehad a fancy for the merry and easy-mannered Drouet, who threw hera pleasant remark now and then, and in other ways extended herthe evidence of that regard which he had for all members of thesex.  Hurstwood was more reserved and critical in his manner.  Hedid not appeal to this bodiced functionary in the same pleasantway.  She wondered that he came so frequently, that Mrs. Drouetshould go out with him this afternoon when Mr. Drouet was absent.She gave vent to her opinions in the kitchen where the cook was.As a result, a hum of gossip was set going which moved about thehouse in that secret manner common to gossip.
　　Carrie, now that she had yielded sufficiently to Hurstwood toconfess her affection, no longer troubled about her attitudetowards him.  Temporarily she gave little thought to Drouet,thinking only of the dignity and grace of her lover and of hisconsuming affection for her.  On the first evening, she didlittle but go over the details of the afternoon.  It was thefirst time her sympathies had ever been thoroughly aroused, andthey threw a new light on her character.  She had some power ofinitiative, latent before, which now began to exert itself.  Shelooked more practically upon her state and began to seeglimmerings of a way out.  Hurstwood seemed a drag in thedirection of honour.  Her feelings were exceedingly creditable,in that they constructed out of these recent developmentssomething which conquered freedom from dishonour.  She had noidea what Hurstwood's next word would be.  She only took hisaffection to be a fine thing, and appended better, more generousresults accordingly.
　　As yet, Hurstwood had only a thought of pleasure withoutresponsibility.  He did not feel that he was doing anything tocomplicate his life.  His position was secure, his home-life, ifnot satisfactory, was at least undisturbed, his personal libertyrather untrammelled.  Carrie's love represented only so muchadded pleasure.  He would enjoy this new gift over and above hisordinary allowance of pleasure.  He would be happy with her andhis own affairs would go on as they had, undisturbed.
　　On Sunday evening Carrie dined with him at a place he hadselected in East Adams Street, and thereafter they took a cab towhat was then a pleasant evening resort out on Cottage GroveAvenue near 39th Street.  In the process of his declaration hesoon realised that Carrie took his love upon a higher basis thanhe had anticipated.  She kept him at a distance in a ratherearnest way, and submitted only to those tender tokens ofaffection which better become the inexperienced lover.  Hurstwoodsaw that she was not to be possessed for the asking, and deferredpressing his suit too warmly.
　　Since he feigned to believe in her married state he found that hehad to carry out the part.  His triumph, he saw, was still at alittle distance.  How far he could not guess.
　　They were returning to Ogden Place in the cab, when he asked:
　　"When will I see you again?"
　　"I don't know," she answered, wondering herself.
　　"Why not come down to The Fair," he suggested, "next Tuesday?"
　　She shook her head.
　　"Not so soon," she answered.
　　"I'll tell you what I'll do," he added.  "I'll write you, care ofthis West Side Post-office.  Could you call next Tuesday?"
　　Carrie assented.
　　The cab stopped one door out of the way according to his call.
　　"Good-night," he whispered, as the cab rolled away.
　　Unfortunately for the smooth progression of this affair, Drouetreturned.  Hurstwood was sitting in his imposing little officethe next afternoon when he saw Drouet enter.
　　"Why, hello, Charles," he called affably; "back again?"
　　"Yes," smiled Drouet, approaching and looking in at the door.
　　Hurstwood arose.
　　"Well," he said, looking the drummer over, "rosy as ever, eh?"
　　They began talking of the people they knew and things that hadhappened.
　　"Been home yet?" finally asked Hurstwood.
　　"No, I am going, though," said Drouet.
　　"I remembered the little girl out there," said Hurstwood, "andcalled once.  Thought you wouldn't want her left quite alone."
　　"Right you are," agreed Drouet.  "How is she?"
　　"Very well," said Hurstwood.  "Rather anxious about you though.You'd better go out now and cheer her up."
　　"I will," said Drouet, smilingly.
　　"Like to have you both come down and go to the show with meWednesday," concluded Hurstwood at parting.
　　"Thanks, old man," said his friend, "I'll see what the girl saysand let you know."
　　They separated in the most cordial manner.
　　"There's a nice fellow," Drouet thought to himself as he turnedthe corner towards Madison.
　　"Drouet is a good fellow," Hurstwood thought to himself as hewent back into his office, "but he's no man for Carrie."
　　The thought of the latter turned his mind into a most pleasantvein, and he wandered how he would get ahead of the drummer.
　　When Drouet entered Carrie's presence, he caught her in his armsas usual, but she responded to his kiss with a tremour ofopposition.
　　"Well," he said, "I had a great trip."
　　"Did you? How did you come out with that La Crosse man you weretelling me about?"
　　"Oh, fine; sold him a complete line.  There was another fellowthere, representing Burnstein, a regular hook-nosed sheeny, buthe wasn't in it.  I made him look like nothing at all."
　　As he undid his collar and unfastened his studs, preparatory towashing his face and changing his clothes, he dilated upon histrip.  Carrie could not help listening with amusement to hisanimated descriptions.
　　"I tell you," he said, "I surprised the people at the office.I've sold more goods this last quarter than any other man of ourhouse on the road.  I sold three thousand dollars' worth in LaCrosse."
　　He plunged his face in a basin of water, and puffed and blew ashe rubbed his neck and ears with his hands, while Carrie gazedupon him with mingled thoughts of recollection and presentjudgment.  He was still wiping his face, when he continued:
　　"I'm going to strike for a raise in June.  They can afford to payit, as much business as I turn in.  I'll get it too, don't youforget."
　　"I hope you do," said Carrie.
　　"And then if that little real estate deal I've got on goesthrough, we'll get married," he said with a great show ofearnestness, the while he took his place before the mirror andbegan brushing his hair.
　　"I don't believe you ever intend to marry me, Charlie," Carriesaid ruefully.  The recent protestations of Hurstwood had givenher courage to say this.
　　"Oh, yes I do--course I do--what put that into your head?"
　　He had stopped his trifling before the mirror now and crossedover to her.  For the first time Carrie felt as if she must moveaway from him.
　　"But you've been saying that so long," she said, looking with herpretty face upturned into his.
　　"Well, and I mean it too, but it takes money to live as I wantto.  Now, when I get this increase, I can come pretty near fixingthings all right, and I'll do it.  Now, don't you worry, girlie."
　　He patted her reassuringly upon the shoulder, but Carrie felt howreally futile had been her hopes.  She could clearly see thatthis easy-going soul intended no move in her behalf.  He wassimply letting things drift because he preferred the free roundof his present state to any legal trammellings.
　　In contrast, Hurstwood appeared strong and sincere.  He had noeasy manner of putting her off.  He sympathised with her andshowed her what her true value was.  He needed her, while Drouetdid not care.
　　"Oh, no," she said remorsefully, her tone reflecting some of herown success and more of her helplessness, "you never will."
　　"Well, you wait a little while and see," he concluded.  "I'llmarry you all right."
　　Carrie looked at him and felt justified.  She was looking forsomething which would calm her conscience, and here it was, alight, airy disregard of her claims upon his justice.  He hadfaithfully promised to marry her, and this was the way hefulfilled his promise.
　　"Say," he said, after he had, as he thought, pleasantly disposedof the marriage question, "I saw Hurstwood to-day, and he wantsus to go to the theatre with him."
　　Carrie started at the name, but recovered quickly enough to avoidnotice.
　　"When?" she asked, with assumed indifference.
　　"Wednesday.  We'll go, won't we?"
　　"If you think so," she answered, her manner being so enforcedlyreserved as to almost excite suspicion.  Drouet noticed somethingbut he thought it was due to her feelings concerning their talkabout marriage."He called once, he said."
　　"Yes," said Carrie, "he was out here Sunday evening."
　　"Was he?" said Drouet.  "I thought from what he said that he hadcalled a week or so ago."
　　"So he did," answered Carrie, who was wholly unaware of whatconversation her lovers might have held.  She was all at seamentally, and fearful of some entanglement which might ensue fromwhat she would answer.
　　"Oh, then he called twice?" said Drouet, the first shade ofmisunderstanding showing in his face.
　　"Yes," said Carrie innocently, feeling now that Hurstwood musthave mentioned but one call.
　　Drouet imagined that he must have misunderstood his friend.  Hedid not attach particular importance to the information, afterall.
　　"What did he have to say?" he queried, with slightly increasedcuriosity.
　　"He said he came because he thought I might be lonely.  Youhadn't been in there so long he wondered what had become of you."
　　"George is a fine fellow," said Drouet, rather gratified by hisconception of the manager's interest.  "Come on and we'll go outto dinner."
　　When Hurstwood saw that Drouet was back he wrote at once toCarrie, saying:
　　"I told him I called on you, dearest, when he was away.  I didnot say how often, but he probably thought once.  Let me know ofanything you may have said.  Answer by special messenger when youget this, and, darling, I must see you.  Let me know if you can'tmeet me at Jackson and Throop Streets Wednesday afternoon at twoo'clock.  I want to speak with you before we meet at thetheatre."
　　Carrie received this Tuesday morning when she called at the WestSide branch of the post-office, and answered at once.
　　"I said you called twice," she wrote.  "He didn't seem to mind.I will try and be at Throop Street if nothing interferes.  I seemto be getting very bad.  It's wrong to act as I do, I know."
　　Hurstwood, when he met her as agreed, reassured her on thisscore.
　　"You mustn't worry, sweetheart," he said.  "Just as soon as hegoes on the road again we will arrange something.  We'll fix itso that you won't have to deceive any one."
　　Carrie imagined that he would marry her at once, though he hadnot directly said so, and her spirits rose.  She proposed to makethe best of the situation until Drouet left again.
　　"Don't show any more interest in me than you ever have,"Hurstwood counselled concerning the evening at the theatre.
　　"You mustn't look at me steadily then," she answered, mindful ofthe power of his eyes.
　　"I won't," he said, squeezing her hand at parting and giving theglance she had just cautioned against.
　　"There," she said playfully, pointing a finger at him.
　　"The show hasn't begun yet," he returned.
　　He watched her walk from him with tender solicitation.  Suchyouth and prettiness reacted upon him more subtly than wine.
　　At the theatre things passed as they had in Hurstwood's favour.If he had been pleasing to Carrie before, how much more so was henow.  His grace was more permeating because it found a readiermedium.  Carrie watched his every movement with pleasure.  Shealmost forgot poor Drouet, who babbled on as if he were the host.
　　Hurstwood was too clever to give the slightest indication of achange.  He paid, if anything, more attention to his old friendthan usual, and yet in no way held him up to that subtle ridiculewhich a lover in favour may so secretly practise before themistress of his heart.  If anything, he felt the injustice of thegame as it stood, and was not cheap enough to add to it theslightest mental taunt.
　　Only the play produced an ironical situation, and this was due toDrouet alone.
　　The scene was one in "The Covenant," in which the wife listenedto the seductive voice of a lover in the absence of her husband.
　　"Served him right," said Drouet afterward, even in view of herkeen expiation of her error.  "I haven't any pity for a man whowould be such a chump as that."
　　"Well, you never can tell," returned Hurstwood gently.  "Heprobably thought he was right."
　　"Well, a man ought to be more attentive than that to his wife ifhe wants to keep her."
　　They had come out of the lobby and made their way through theshowy crush about the entrance way.
　　"Say, mister," said a voice at Hurstwood's side, "would you mindgiving me the price of a bed?"
　　Hurstwood was interestedly remarking to Carrie.
　　"Honest to God, mister, I'm without a place to sleep."
　　The plea was that of a gaunt-faced man of about thirty, wholooked the picture of privation and wretchedness.  Drouet was thefirst to see.  He handed over a dime with an upwelling feeling ofpity in his heart.  Hurstwood scarcely noticed the incident.Carrie quickly forgot.
　　Chapter XV
　　THE IRK OF THE OLD TIES--THE MAGIC OF YOUTH
　　The complete ignoring by Hurstwood of his own home came with thegrowth of his affection for Carrie.  His actions, in all thatrelated to his family, were of the most perfunctory kind.  He satat breakfast with his wife and children, absorbed in his ownfancies, which reached far without the realm of their interests.He read his paper, which was heightened in interest by theshallowness of the themes discussed by his son and daughter.Between himself and his wife ran a river of indifference.
　　Now that Carrie had come, he was in a fair way to be blissfulagain.  There was delight in going down town evenings.  When hewalked forth in the short days, the street lamps had a merrytwinkle.  He began to experience the almost forgotten feelingwhich hastens the lover's feet.  When he looked at his fineclothes, he saw them with her eyes--and her eyes were young.
　　When in the flush of such feelings he heard his wife's voice,when the insistent demands of matrimony recalled him from dreamsto a stale practice, how it grated.  He then knew that this was achain which bound his feet.
　　"George," said Mrs. Hurstwood, in that tone of voice which hadlong since come to be associated in his mind with demands, "wewant you to get us a season ticket to the races."
　　"Do you want to go to all of them?" he said with a risinginflection.
　　"Yes," she answered.
　　The races in question were soon to open at Washington Park, onthe South Side, and were considered quite society affairs amongthose who did not affect religious rectitude and conservatism.Mrs. Hurstwood had never asked for a whole season ticket before,but this year certain considerations decided her to get a box.For one thing, one of her neighbours, a certain Mr. and Mrs.Ramsey, who were possessors of money, made out of the coalbusiness, had done so.  In the next place, her favouritephysician, Dr. Beale, a gentleman inclined to horses and betting,had talked with her concerning his intention to enter a two-year-old in the Derby.  In the third place, she wished to exhibitJessica, who was gaining in maturity and beauty, and whom shehoped to marry to a man of means.  Her own desire to be about insuch things and parade among her acquaintances and common throngwas as much an incentive as anything.
　　Hurstwood thought over the proposition a few moments withoutanswering.  They were in the sitting room on the second floor,waiting for supper.  It was the evening of his engagement withCarrie and Drouet to see "The Covenant," which had brought himhome to make some alterations in his dress.
　　"You're sure separate tickets wouldn't do as well?" he asked,hesitating to say anything more rugged.
　　"No," she replied impatiently.
　　"Well," he said, taking offence at her manner, "you needn't getmad about it.  I'm just asking you."
　　"I'm not mad," she snapped.  "I'm merely asking you for a seasonticket."
　　"And I'm telling you," he returned, fixing a clear, steady eye onher, "that it's no easy thing to get.  I'm not sure whether themanager will give it to me."
　　He had been thinking all the time of his "pull" with the race-track magnates.
　　"We can buy it then," she exclaimed sharply.
　　"You talk easy," he said.  "A season family ticket costs onehundred and fifty dollars."
　　"I'll not argue with you," she replied with determination.  "Iwant the ticket and that's all there is to it."
　　She had risen, and now walked angrily out of the room.
　　"Well, you get it then," he said grimly, though in a modifiedtone of voice.
　　As usual, the table was one short that evening.
　　The next morning he had cooled down considerably, and later theticket was duly secured, though it did not heal matters.  He didnot mind giving his family a fair share of all that he earned,but he did not like to be forced to provide against his will.
　　"Did you know, mother," said Jessica another day, "the Spencersare getting ready to go away?"
　　"No.  Where, I wonder?"
　　"Europe," said Jessica.  "I met Georgine yesterday and she toldme.  She just put on more airs about it."
　　"Did she say when?"
　　"Monday, I think.  They'll get a notice in the papers again--theyalways do."
　　"Never mind," said Mrs. Hurstwood consolingly, "we'll go one ofthese days."
　　Hurstwood moved his eyes over the paper slowly, but said nothing.
　　"'We sail for Liverpool from New York,'" Jessica exclaimed,mocking her acquaintance.  "'Expect to spend most of the "summah"in France,'--vain thing.  As If it was anything to go to Europe."
　　"It must be if you envy her so much," put in Hurstwood.
　　It grated upon him to see the feeling his daughter displayed.
　　"Don't worry over them, my dear," said Mrs. Hurstwood.
　　"Did George get off?" asked Jessica of her mother another day,thus revealing something that Hurstwood had heard nothing about.
　　"Where has he gone?" he asked, looking up.  He had never beforebeen kept in ignorance concerning departures.
　　"He was going to Wheaton," said Jessica, not noticing the slightput upon her father.
　　"What's out there?" he asked, secretly irritated and chagrined tothink that he should be made to pump for information in thismanner.
　　"A tennis match," said Jessica.
　　"He didn't say anything to me," Hurstwood concluded, finding itdifficult to refrain from a bitter tone.
　　"I guess he must have forgotten," exclaimed his wife blandly.  Inthe past he had always commanded a certain amount of respect,which was a compound of appreciation and awe.  The familiaritywhich in part still existed between himself and his daughter hehad courted.  As it was, it did not go beyond the lightassumption of words.  The TONE was always modest.  Whatever hadbeen, however, had lacked affection, and now he saw that he waslosing track of their doings.  His knowledge was no longerintimate.  He sometimes saw them at table, and sometimes did not.He heard of their doings occasionally, more often not.  Some dayshe found that he was all at sea as to what they were talkingabout--things they had arranged to do or that they had done inhis absence.  More affecting was the feeling that there werelittle things going on of which he no longer heard.  Jessica wasbeginning to feel that her affairs were her own.  George, Jr.,flourished about as if he were a man entirely and must needs haveprivate matters.  All this Hurstwood could see, and it left atrace of feeling, for he was used to being considered--in hisofficial position, at least--and felt that his importance shouldnot begin to wane here.  To darken it all, he saw the sameindifference and independence growing in his wife, while helooked on and paid the bills.
　　He consoled himself with the thought, however, that, after all,he was not without affection.  Things might go as they would athis house, but he had Carrie outside of it.  With his mind's eyehe looked into her comfortable room in Ogden Place, where he hadspent several such delightful evenings, and thought how charmingit would be when Drouet was disposed of entirely and she waswaiting evenings in cosey little quarters for him.  That no causewould come up whereby Drouet would be led to inform Carrieconcerning his married state, he felt hopeful.  Things were goingso smoothly that he believed they would not change.  Shortly nowhe would persuade Carrie and all would be satisfactory.
　　The day after their theatre visit he began writing her regularly--a letter every morning, and begging her to do as much for him.He was not literary by any means, but experience of the world andhis growing affection gave him somewhat of a style.  This heexercised at his office desk with perfect deliberation.  Hepurchased a box of delicately coloured and scented writing paperin monogram, which he kept locked in one of the drawers.  Hisfriends now wondered at the cleric and very official-lookingnature of his position.  The five bartenders viewed with respectthe duties which could call a man to do so much desk-work andpenmanship.
　　Hurstwood surprised himself with his fluency.  By the natural lawwhich governs all effort, what he wrote reacted upon him.  Hebegan to feel those subtleties which he could find words toexpress.  With every expression came increased conception.  Thoseinmost breathings which there found words took hold upon him.  Hethought Carrie worthy of all the affection he could thereexpress.
　　Carrie was indeed worth loving if ever youth and grace are tocommand that token of acknowledgment from life in their bloom.Experience had not yet taken away that freshness of the spiritwhich is the charm of the body.  Her soft eyes contained in theirliquid lustre no suggestion of the knowledge of disappointment.She had been troubled in a way by doubt and longing, but thesehad made no deeper impression than could be traced in a certainopen wistfulness of glance and speech.  The mouth had theexpression at times, in talking and in repose, of one who mightbe upon the verge of tears.  It was not that grief was thus everpresent.  The pronunciation of certain syllables gave to her lipsthis peculiarity of formation--a formation as suggestive andmoving as pathos itself.
　　There was nothing bold in her manner.  Life had not taught herdomination--superciliousness of grace, which is the lordly powerof some women.  Her longing for consideration was notsufficiently powerful to move her to demand it.  Even now shelacked self-assurance, but there was that in what she had alreadyexperienced which left her a little less than timid.  She wantedpleasure, she wanted position, and yet she was confused as towhat these things might be.  Every hour the kaleidoscope of humanaffairs threw a new lustre upon something, and therewith itbecame for her the desired--the all.  Another shift of the box,and some other had become the beautiful, the perfect.
　　On her spiritual side, also, she was rich in feeling, as such anature well might be.  Sorrow in her was aroused by many aspectacle--an uncritical upwelling of grief for the weak and thehelpless.  She was constantly pained by the sight of the white-faced, ragged men who slopped desperately by her in a sort ofwretched mental stupor.  The poorly clad girls who went blowingby her window evenings, hurrying home from some of the shops ofthe West Side, she pitied from the depths of her heart.  Shewould stand and bite her lips as they passed, shaking her littlehead and wondering.  They had so little, she thought.  It was sosad to be ragged and poor.  The hang of faded clothes pained hereyes.
　　"And they have to work so hard!" was her only comment.
　　On the street sometimes she would see men working--Irishmen withpicks, coal-heavers with great loads to shovel, Americans busyabout some work which was a mere matter of strength--and theytouched her fancy.  Toil, now that she was free of it, seemedeven a more desolate thing than when she was part of it.  She sawit through a mist of fancy--a pale, sombre half-light, which wasthe essence of poetic feeling.  Her old father, in his flour-dusted miller's suit, sometimes returned to her in memory,revived by a face in a window.  A shoemaker pegging at his last,a blastman seen through a narrow window in some basement whereiron was being melted, a bench-worker seen high aloft in somewindow, his coat off, his sleeves rolled up; these took her backin fancy to the details of the mill.  She felt, though she seldomexpressed them, sad thoughts upon this score.  Her sympathieswere ever with that under-world of toil from which she had sorecently sprung, and which she best understood.
　　Though Hurstwood did not know it, he was dealing with one whosefeelings were as tender and as delicate as this.  He did notknow, but it was this in her, after all, which attracted him.  Henever attempted to analyse the nature of his affection.  It wassufficient that there was tenderness in her eye, weakness in hermanner, good nature and hope in her thoughts.  He drew near thislily, which had sucked its waxen beauty and perfume from below adepth of waters which he had never penetrated, and out of oozeand mould which he could not understand.  He drew near because itwas waxen and fresh.  It lightened his feelings for him.  It madethe morning worth while.
　　In a material way, she was considerably improved.  Herawkwardness had all but passed, leaving, if anything, a quaintresidue which was as pleasing as perfect grace.  Her little shoesnow fitted her smartly and had high heels.  She had learned muchabout laces and those little neckpieces which add so much to awoman's appearance.  Her form had filled out until it wasadmirably plump and well-rounded.
　　Hurstwood wrote her one morning, asking her to meet him inJefferson Park, Monroe Street.  He did not consider it policy tocall any more, even when Drouet was at home.
　　The next afternoon he was in the pretty little park by one, andhad found a rustic bench beneath the green leaves of a lilac bushwhich bordered one of the paths.  It was at that season of theyear when the fulness of spring had not yet worn quite away.  Ata little pond near by some cleanly dressed children were sailingwhite canvas boats.  In the shade of a green pagoda a bebuttonedofficer of the law was resting, his arms folded, his club at restin his belt.  An old gardener was upon the lawn, with a pair ofpruning shears, looking after some bushes.  High overhead was theclean blue sky of the new summer, and in the thickness of theshiny green leaves of the trees hopped and twittered the busysparrows.
　　Hurstwood had come out of his own home that morning feeling muchof the same old annoyance.  At his store he had idled, therebeing no need to write.  He had come away to this place with thelightness of heart which characterises those who put wearinessbehind.  Now, in the shade of this cool, green bush, he lookedabout him with the fancy of the lover.  He heard the carts golumbering by upon the neighbouring streets, but they were faroff, and only buzzed upon his ear.  The hum of the surroundingcity was faint, the clang of an occasional bell was as music.  Helooked and dreamed a new dream of pleasure which concerned hispresent fixed condition not at all.  He got back in fancy to theold Hurstwood, who was neither married nor fixed in a solidposition for life.  He remembered the light spirit in which heonce looked after the girls--how he had danced, escorted themhome, hung over their gates.  He almost wished he was back thereagain--here in this pleasant scene he felt as if he were whollyfree.
　　At two Carrie came tripping along the walk toward him, rosy andclean.  She had just recently donned a sailor hat for the seasonwith a band of pretty white-dotted blue silk.  Her skirt was of arich blue material, and her shirt waist matched it, with a thin-stripe of blue upon a snow-white ground--stripes that were asfine as hairs.  Her brown shoes peeped occasionally from beneathher skirt.  She carried her gloves in her hand.
　　Hurstwood looked up at her with delight.
　　"You came, dearest," he said eagerly, standing to meet her andtaking her hand.
　　"Of course," she said, smiling; "did you think I wouldn't?"
　　"I didn't know," he replied.
　　He looked at her forehead, which was moist from her brisk walk.Then he took out one of his own soft, scented silk handkerchiefsand touched her face here and there.
　　"Now," he said affectionately, "you're all right."
　　They were happy in being near one another--in looking into eachother's eyes.  Finally, when the long flush of delight had subsided, he said:
　　"When is Charlie going away again?"
　　"I don't know," she answered.  "He says he has some things to dofor the house here now."
　　Hurstwood grew serious, and he lapsed into quiet thought.  Helooked up after a time to say:
　　"Come away and leave him."
　　He turned his eyes to the boys with the boats, as if the requestwere of little importance.
　　"Where would we go?" she asked in much the same manner, rollingher gloves, and looking into a neighbouring tree.
　　"Where do you want to go?" he enquired.
　　There was something in the tone in which he said this which madeher feel as if she must record her feelings against any localhabitation.
　　"We can't stay in Chicago," she replied.
　　He had no thought that this was in her mind--that any removalwould be suggested.
　　"Why not?" he asked softly.
　　"Oh, because," she said, "I wouldn't want to."
　　He listened to this with but dull perception of what it meant.It had no serious ring to it.  The question was not up forimmediate decision.
　　"I would have to give up my position," he said.
　　The tone he used made it seem as if the matter deserved onlyslight consideration.  Carrie thought a little, the whileenjoying the pretty scene.
　　"I wouldn't like to live in Chicago and him here," she said,thinking of Drouet.
　　"It's a big town, dearest," Hurstwood answered.  "It would be asgood as moving to another part of the country to move to theSouth Side."
　　He had fixed upon that region as an objective point.
　　"Anyhow," said Carrie, "I shouldn't want to get married as longas he is here.  I wouldn't want to run away."
　　The suggestion of marriage struck Hurstwood forcibly.  He sawclearly that this was her idea--he felt that it was not to begotten over easily.  Bigamy lightened the horizon of his shadowythoughts for a moment.  He wondered for the life of him how itwould all come out.  He could not see that he was making anyprogress save in her regard.  When he looked at her now, hethought her beautiful.  What a thing it was to have her love him,even if it be entangling! She increased in value in his eyesbecause of her objection.  She was something to struggle for, andthat was everything.  How different from the women who yieldedwillingly! He swept the thought of them from his mind.
　　"And you don't know when he'll go away?" asked Hurstwood,quietly.
　　She shook her head.
　　He sighed.
　　"You're a determined little miss, aren't you?" he said, after afew moments, looking up into her eyes.
　　She felt a wave of feeling sweep over her at this.  It was prideat what seemed his admiration--affection for the man who couldfeel this concerning her.
　　"No," she said coyly, "but what can I do?"
　　Again he folded his hands and looked away over the lawn into thestreet.
　　"I wish," he said pathetically, "you would come to me.  I don'tlike to be away from you this way.  What good is there inwaiting? You're not any happier, are you?"
　　"Happier!" she exclaimed softly, "you know better than that."
　　"Here we are then," he went on in the same tone, "wasting ourdays.  If you are not happy, do you think I am? I sit and writeto you the biggest part of the time.  I'll tell you what,Carrie," he exclaimed, throwing sudden force of expression intohis voice and fixing her with his eyes, "I can't live withoutyou, and that's all there is to it.  Now," he concluded, showingthe palm of one of his white hands in a sort of at-an-end,helpless expression, "what shall I do?"
　　This shifting of the burden to her appealed to Carrie.  Thesemblance of the load without the weight touched the woman'sheart.
　　"Can't you wait a little while yet?" she said tenderly.  "I'lltry and find out when he's going."
　　"What good will it do?" he asked, holding the same strain offeeling.
　　"Well, perhaps we can arrange to go somewhere."
　　She really did not see anything clearer than before, but she wasgetting into that frame of mind where, out of sympathy, a womanyields.
　　Hurstwood did not understand.  He was wondering how she was to bepersuaded--what appeal would move her to forsake Drouet.  Hebegan to wonder how far her affection for him would carry her.He was thinking of some question which would make her tell.
　　Finally he hit upon one of those problematical propositions whichoften disguise our own desires while leading us to anunderstanding of the difficulties which others make for us, andso discover for us a way.  It had not the slightest connectionwith anything intended on his part, and was spoken at randombefore he had given it a moment's serious thought.
　　"Carrie," he said, looking into her face and assuming a seriouslook which he did not feel, "suppose I were to come to you nextweek, or this week for that matter--to-night say--and tell you Ihad to go away--that I couldn't stay another minute and wasn'tcoming back any more--would you come with me?"His sweetheart viewed him with the most affectionate glance, heranswer ready before the words were out of his mouth.
　　"Yes," she said.
　　"You wouldn't stop to argue or arrange?"
　　"Not if you couldn't wait."
　　He smiled when he saw that she took him seriously, and he thoughtwhat a chance it would afford for a possible junket of a week ortwo.  He had a notion to tell her that he was joking and so brushaway her sweet seriousness, but the effect of it was toodelightful.  He let it stand.
　　"Suppose we didn't have time to get married here?" he added, anafterthought striking him.
　　"If we got married as soon as we got to the other end of thejourney it would be all right."
　　"I meant that," he said.
　　"Yes."
　　The morning seemed peculiarly bright to him now.  He wonderedwhatever could have put such a thought into his head.  Impossibleas it was, he could not help smiling at its cleverness.  Itshowed how she loved him.  There was no doubt in his mind now,and he would find a way to win her.
　　"Well," he said, jokingly, "I'll come and get you one of theseevenings," and then he laughed.
　　"I wouldn't stay with you, though, if you didn't marry me,"Carrie added reflectively.
　　"I don't want you to," he said tenderly, taking her hand.
　　She was extremely happy now that she understood.  She loved himthe more for thinking that he would rescue her so.  As for him,the marriage clause did not dwell in his mind.  He was thinkingthat with such affection there could be no bar to his eventualhappiness.
　　"Let's stroll about," he said gayly, rising and surveying all thelovely park.
　　"All right," said Carrie.
　　They passed the young Irishman, who looked after them withenvious eyes.
　　"'Tis a foine couple," he observed to himself.  "They must berich."
　　Chapter XVI
　　A WITLESS ALADDIN--THE GATE TO THE WORLD
　　In the course of his present stay in Chicago, Drouet paid someslight attention to the secret order to which he belonged.During his last trip he had received a new light on itsimportance.
　　"I tell you," said another drummer to him, "it's a great thing.Look at Hazenstab.  He isn't so deuced clever.  Of course he'sgot a good house behind him, but that won't do alone.  I tell youit's his degree.  He's a way-up Mason, and that goes a long way.He's got a secret sign that stands for something."
　　Drouet resolved then and there that he would take more interestin such matters.  So when he got back to Chicago he repaired tohis local lodge headquarters.
　　"I say, Drouet," said Mr. Harry Quincel, an individual who wasvery prominent in this local branch of the Elks, "you're the manthat can help us out."
　　It was after the business meeting and things were going sociallywith a hum.  Drouet was bobbing around chatting and joking with ascore of individuals whom he knew.
　　"What are you up to?" he inquired genially, turning a smilingface upon his secret brother.
　　"We're trying to get up some theatricals for two weeks from to-day, and we want to know if you don't know some young lady whocould take a part--it's an easy part."
　　"Sure," said Drouet, "what is it?" He did not trouble to rememberthat he knew no one to whom he could appeal on this score.  Hisinnate good-nature, however, dictated a favourable reply.
　　"Well, now, I'll tell you what we are trying to do," went on Mr.Quincel.  "We are trying to get a new set of furniture for thelodge.  There isn't enough money in the treasury at the presenttime, and we thought we would raise it by a littleentertainment."
　　"Sure," interrupted Drouet, "that's a good idea."
　　"Several of the boys around here have got talent.  There's HarryBurbeck, he does a fine black-face turn.  Mac Lewis is all rightat heavy dramatics.  Did you ever hear him recite 'Over theHills'?"
　　"Never did."
　　"Well, I tell you, he does it fine."
　　"And you want me to get some woman to take a part?" questionedDrouet, anxious to terminate the subject and get on to somethingelse.  "What are you going to play?"
　　"'Under the Gaslight,'" said Mr. Quincel, mentioning AugustinDaly's famous production, which had worn from a great publicsuccess down to an amateur theatrical favourite, with many of thetroublesome accessories cut out and the dramatis personae reducedto the smallest possible number.
　　Drouet had seen this play some time in the past.
　　"That's it," he said; "that's a fine play.  It will go all right.You ought to make a lot of money out of that."
　　"We think we'll do very well," Mr. Quincel replied.  "Don't youforget now," he concluded, Drouet showing signs of restlessness;"some young woman to take the part of Laura."
　　"Sure, I'll attend to it."
　　He moved away, forgetting almost all about it the moment Mr.Quincel had ceased talking.  He had not even thought to ask thetime or place.
　　Drouet was reminded of his promise a day or two later by thereceipt of a letter announcing that the first rehearsal was setfor the following Friday evening, and urging him to kindlyforward the young lady's address at once, in order that the partmight be delivered to her.
　　"Now, who the deuce do I know?" asked the drummer reflectively,scratching his rosy ear.  "I don't know any one that knowsanything about amateur theatricals."
　　He went over in memory the names of a number of women he knew,and finally fixed on one, largely because of the convenientlocation of her home on the West Side, and promised himself thatas he came out that evening he would see her.  When, however, hestarted west on the car he forgot, and was only reminded of hisdelinquency by an item in the "Evening News"--a small three-lineaffair under the head of Secret Society Notes--which stated theCuster Lodge of the Order of Elks would give a theatricalperformance in Avery Hall on the 16th, when "Under the Gaslight"would be produced.
　　"George!" exclaimed Drouet, "I forgot that."
　　"What?" inquired Carrie.
　　They were at their little table in the room which might have beenused for a kitchen, where Carrie occasionally served a meal.  To-night the fancy had caught her, and the little table was spreadwith a pleasing repast.
　　"Why, my lodge entertainment.  They're going to give a play, andthey wanted me to get them some young lady to take a part."
　　"What is it they're going to play?"
　　"'Under the Gaslight.'"
　　"When?"
　　"On the 16th."
　　"Well, why don't you?" asked Carrie.
　　"I don't know any one," he replied.
　　Suddenly he looked up.
　　"Say," he said, "how would you like to take the part?"
　　"Me?" said Carrie.  "I can't act."
　　"How do you know?" questioned Drouet reflectively.
　　"Because," answered Carrie, "I never did."
　　Nevertheless, she was pleased to think he would ask.  Her eyesbrightened, for if there was anything that enlisted hersympathies it was the art of the stage.True to his nature, Drouet clung to this idea as an easy way out.
　　"That's nothing.  You can act all you have to down there."
　　"No, I can't," said Carrie weakly, very much drawn toward theproposition and yet fearful.
　　"Yes, you can.  Now, why don't you do it? They need some one, andit will be lots of fun for you."
　　"Oh, no, it won't," said Carrie seriously.
　　"You'd like that.  I know you would.  I've seen you dancingaround here and giving imitations and that's why I asked you.You're clever enough, all right."
　　"No, I'm not," said Carrie shyly.
　　"Now, I'll tell you what you do.  You go down and see about it.It'll be fun for you.  The rest of the company isn't going to beany good.  They haven't any experience.  What do they know abouttheatricals?"
　　He frowned as he thought of their ignorance.
　　"Hand me the coffee," he added.
　　"I don't believe I could act, Charlie," Carrie went on pettishly."You don't think I could, do you?"
　　"Sure.  Out o' sight.  I bet you make a hit.  Now you want to go,I know you do.  I knew it when I came home.  That's why I askedyou."
　　"What is the play, did you say?"
　　"'Under the Gaslight.'"
　　"What part would they want me to take?"
　　"Oh, one of the heroines--I don't know."
　　"What sort of a play is it?"
　　"Well," said Drouet, whose memory for such things was not thebest, "it's about a girl who gets kidnapped by a couple ofcrooks--a man and a woman that live in the slums.  She had somemoney or something and they wanted to get it.  I don't know nowhow it did go exactly."
　　"Don't you know what part I would have to take?"
　　"No, I don't, to tell the truth." He thought a moment.  "Yes, Ido, too.  Laura, that's the thing--you're to be Laura."
　　"And you can't remember what the part is like?"
　　"To save me, Cad, I can't," he answered.  "I ought to, too; I'veseen the play enough.  There's a girl in it that was stolen whenshe was an infant--was picked off the street or something--andshe's the one that's hounded by the two old criminals I wastelling you about." He stopped with a mouthful of pie poised on afork before his face.  "She comes very near getting drowned--no,that's not it.  I'll tell you what I'll do," he concludedhopelessly, "I'll get you the book.  I can't remember now for thelife of me."
　　"Well, I don't know," said Carrie, when he had concluded, herinterest and desire to shine dramatically struggling with hertimidity for the mastery.  "I might go if you thought I'd do allright."
　　"Of course, you'll do," said Drouet, who, in his efforts toenthuse Carrie, had interested himself.  "Do you think I'd comehome here and urge you to do something that I didn't think youwould make a success of? You can act all right.  It'll be goodfor you."
　　"When must I go?" said Carrie, reflectively.
　　"The first rehearsal is Friday night.  I'll get the part for youto-night."
　　"All right," said Carrie resignedly, "I'll do it, but if I make afailure now it's your fault."
　　"You won't fail," assured Drouet.  "Just act as you do aroundhere.  Be natural.  You're all right.  I've often thought you'dmake a corking good actress."
　　"Did you really?" asked Carrie.
　　"That's right," said the drummer.
　　He little knew as he went out of the door that night what asecret flame he had kindled in the bosom of the girl he leftbehind.  Carrie was possessed of that sympathetic, impressionablenature which, ever in the most developed form, has been the gloryof the drama.  She was created with that passivity of soul whichis always the mirror of the active world.  She possessed aninnate taste for imitation and no small ability.  Even withoutpractice, she could sometimes restore dramatic situations she hadwitnessed by re-creating, before her mirror, the expressions ofthe various faces taking part in the scene.  She loved tomodulate her voice after the conventional manner of thedistressed heroine, and repeat such pathetic fragments asappealed most to her sympathies.  Of late, seeing the airy graceof the ingenue in several well-constructed plays, she had beenmoved to secretly imitate it, and many were the little movementsand expressions of the body in which she indulged from time totime in the privacy of her chamber.  On several occasions, whenDrouet had caught her admiring herself, as he imagined, in themirror, she was doing nothing more than recalling some littlegrace of the mouth or the eyes which she had witnessed inanother.  Under his airy accusation she mistook this for vanityand accepted the blame with a faint sense of error, though, as amatter of fact, it was nothing more than the first subtleoutcroppings of an artistic nature, endeavouring to re-create theperfect likeness of some phase of beauty which appealed to her.In such feeble tendencies, be it known, such outworking of desireto reproduce life, lies the basis of all dramatic art.
　　Now, when Carrie heard Drouet's laudatory opinion of her dramaticability, her body tingled with satisfaction.  Like the flamewhich welds the loosened particles into a solid mass, his wordsunited those floating wisps of feeling which she had felt, butnever believed, concerning her possible ability, and made theminto a gaudy shred of hope.  Like all human beings, she had atouch of vanity.  She felt that she could do things if she onlyhad a chance.  How often had she looked at the well-dressedactresses on the stage and wondered how she would look, howdelightful she would feel if only she were in their place.  Theglamour, the tense situation, the fine clothes, the applause,these had lured her until she felt that she, too, could act--thatshe, too, could compel acknowledgment of power.  Now she was toldthat she really could--that little things she had done about thehouse had made even him feel her power.  It was a delightfulsensation while it lasted.
　　When Drouet was gone, she sat down in her rocking-chair by thewindow to think about it.  As usual, imagination exaggerated thepossibilities for her.  It was as if he had put fifty cents inher hand and she had exercised the thoughts of a thousanddollars.  She saw herself in a score of pathetic situations inwhich she assumed a tremulous voice and suffering manner.  Hermind delighted itself with scenes of luxury and refinement,situations in which she was the cynosure of all eyes, the arbiterof all fates.  As she rocked to and fro she felt the tensity ofwoe in abandonment, the magnificence of wrath after deception,the languour of sorrow after defeat.  Thoughts of all thecharming women she had seen in plays--every fancy, every illusionwhich she had concerning the stage--now came back as a returningtide after the ebb.  She built up feelings and a determinationwhich the occasion did not warrant.
　　Drouet dropped in at the lodge when he went down town, andswashed around with a great AIR, as Quincel met him.
　　"Where is that young lady you were going to get for us?" askedthe latter.
　　"I've got her," said Drouet.
　　"Have you?" said Quincel, rather surprised by his promptness;"that's good.  What's her address?" and he pulled out hisnotebook in order to be able to send her part to her.
　　"You want to send her her part?" asked the drummer.
　　"Yes."
　　"Well, I'll take it.  I'm going right by her house in themorning.
　　"What did you say her address was? We only want it in case wehave any information to send her."
　　"Twenty-nine Ogden Place."
　　"And her name?"
　　"Carrie Madenda," said the drummer, firing at random.  The lodgemembers knew him to be single.
　　"That sounds like somebody that can act, doesn't it?" saidQuincel.
　　"Yes, it does."
　　He took the part home to Carrie and handed it to her with themanner of one who does a favour.
　　"He says that's the best part.  Do you think you can do it?"
　　"I don't know until I look it over.  You know I'm afraid, nowthat I've said I would."
　　"Oh, go on.  What have you got to be afraid of? It's a cheapcompany.  The rest of them aren't as good as you are."
　　"Well, I'll see," said Carrie, pleased to have the part, for allher misgivings.
　　He sidled around, dressing and fidgeting before he arranged tomake his next remark.
　　"They were getting ready to print the programmes," he said, "andI gave them the name of Carrie Madenda.  Was that all right?"
　　"Yes, I guess so," said his companion, looking up at him.  Shewas thinking it was slightly strange.
　　"If you didn't make a hit, you know," he went on.
　　"Oh, yes," she answered, rather pleased now with his caution.  Itwas clever for Drouet.
　　"I didn't want to introduce you as my wife, because you'd feelworse then if you didn't GO.  They all know me so well.  Butyou'll GO all right.  Anyhow, you'll probably never meet any ofthem again."
　　"Oh, I don't care," said Carrie desperately.  She was determinednow to have a try at the fascinating game.
　　Drouet breathed a sigh of relief.  He had been afraid that he wasabout to precipitate another conversation upon the marriagequestion.
　　The part of Laura, as Carrie found out when she began to examineit, was one of suffering and tears.  As delineated by Mr. Daly,it was true to the most sacred traditions of melodrama as hefound it when he began his career.  The sorrowful demeanour, thetremolo music, the long, explanatory, cumulative addresses, allwere there.
　　"Poor fellow," read Carrie, consulting the text and drawing hervoice out pathetically.  "Martin, be sure and give him a glass ofwine before he goes."
　　She was surprised at the briefness of the entire part, notknowing that she must be on the stage while others were talking,and not only be there, but also keep herself in harmony with thedramatic movement of the scenes.
　　"I think I can do that, though," she concluded.
　　When Drouet came the next night, she was very much satisfied withher day's study.
　　"Well, how goes it, Caddie?" he said.
　　"All right," she laughed.  "I think I have it memorised nearly."
　　"That's good," he said.  "Let's hear some of it."
　　"Oh, I don't know whether I can get up and say it off here," shesaid bashfully.
　　"Well, I don't know why you shouldn't.  It'll be easier here thanit will there."
　　"I don't know about that," she answered.Eventually she took off the ballroom episode with considerablefeeling, forgetting, as she got deeper in the scene, all aboutDrouet, and letting herself rise to a fine state of feeling.
　　"Good," said Drouet; "fine, out o' sight! You're all rightCaddie, I tell you."
　　He was really moved by her excellent representation and thegeneral appearance of the pathetic little figure as it swayed andfinally fainted to the floor.  He had bounded up to catch her,and now held her laughing in his arms.
　　"Ain't you afraid you'll hurt yourself?" he asked.
　　"Not a bit."
　　"Well, you're a wonder.  Say, I never knew you could do anythinglike that."
　　"I never did, either," said Carrie merrily, her face flushed withdelight.
　　"Well, you can bet that you're all right," said Drouet.  "You cantake my word for that.  You won't fail."
　　Chapter XVII
　　A GLIMPSE THROUGH THE GATEWAY--HOPE LIGHTENS THE EYE
　　The, to Carrie, very important theatrical performance was to takeplace at the Avery on conditions which were to make it morenoteworthy than was at first anticipated.  The little dramaticstudent had written to Hurstwood the very morning her part wasbrought her that she was going to take part in a play.
　　"I really am," she wrote, feeling that he might take it as ajest; "I have my part now, honest, truly."
　　Hurstwood smiled in an indulgent way as he read this.
　　"I wonder what it is going to be? I must see that."
　　He answered at once, making a pleasant reference to her ability."I haven't the slightest doubt you will make a success.  You mustcome to the park to-morrow morning and tell me all about it."
　　Carrie gladly complied, and revealed all the details of theundertaking as she understood it.
　　"Well," he said, "that's fine.  I'm glad to hear it.  Of course,you will do well, you're so clever."
　　He had truly never seen so much spirit in the girl before.  Hertendency to discover a touch of sadness had for the noncedisappeared.  As she spoke her eyes were bright, her cheeks red.She radiated much of the pleasure which her undertakings gaveher.  For all her misgivings--and they were as plentiful as themoments of the day--she was still happy.  She could not repressher delight in doing this little thing which, to an ordinaryobserver, had no importance at all.
　　Hurstwood was charmed by the development of the fact that thegirl had capabilities.  There is nothing so inspiring in life asthe sight of a legitimate ambition, no matter how incipient.  Itgives colour, force, and beauty to the possessor.
　　Carrie was now lightened by a touch of this divine afflatus.  Shedrew to herself commendation from her two admirers which she hadnot earned.  Their affection for her naturally heightened theirperception of what she was trying to do and their approval ofwhat she did.  Her inexperience conserved her own exuberantfancy, which ran riot with every straw of opportunity, making ofit a golden divining rod whereby the treasure of life was to bediscovered.
　　"Let's see," said Hurstwood, "I ought to know some of the boys inthe lodge.  I'm an Elk myself."
　　"Oh, you mustn't let him know I told you."
　　"That's so," said the manager.
　　"I'd like for you to be there, if you want to come, but I don'tsee how you can unless he asks you."
　　"I'll be there," said Hurstwood affectionately.  "I can fix it sohe won't know you told me.  You leave it to me."
　　This interest of the manager was a large thing in itself for theperformance, for his standing among the Elks was something worthtalking about.  Already he was thinking of a box with somefriends, and flowers for Carrie.  He would make it a dress-suitaffair and give the little girl a chance.
　　Within a day or two, Drouet dropped into the Adams Street resort,and he was at once spied by Hurstwood.  It was at five in theafternoon and the place was crowded with merchants, actors,managers, politicians, a goodly company of rotund, rosy figures,silk-hatted, starchy-bosomed, beringed and bescarfpinned to thequeen's taste.  John L. Sullivan, the pugilist, was at one end ofthe glittering bar, surrounded by a company of loudly dressedsports, who were holding a most animated conversation.  Drouetcame across the floor with a festive stride, a new pair of tanshoes squeaking audibly at his progress.
　　"Well, sir," said Hurstwood, "I was wondering what had become ofyou.  I thought you had gone out of town again."
　　Drouet laughed.
　　"If you don't report more regularly we'll have to cut you off thelist."
　　"Couldn't help it," said the drummer, "I've been busy."
　　They strolled over toward the bar amid the noisy, shiftingcompany of notables.  The dressy manager was shaken by the handthree times in as many minutes.
　　"I hear your lodge is going to give a performance," observedHurstwood, in the most offhand manner.
　　"Yes, who told you?"
　　"No one," said Hurstwood.  "They just sent me a couple oftickets, which I can have for two dollars.  Is it going to be anygood?"
　　"I don't know," replied the drummer.  "They've been trying to getme to get some woman to take a part."
　　"I wasn't intending to go," said the manager easily.  "I'llsubscribe, of course.  How are things over there?"
　　"All right.  They're going to fit things up out of the proceeds."
　　"Well," said the manager, "I hope they make a success of it.Have another?"
　　He did not intend to say any more.  Now, if he should appear onthe scene with a few friends, he could say that he had been urgedto come along.  Drouet had a desire to wipe out the possibilityof confusion.
　　"I think the girl is going to take a part in it," he saidabruptly, after thinking it over.
　　"You don't say so! How did that happen?"
　　"Well, they were short and wanted me to find them some one.  Itold Carrie, and she seems to want to try."
　　"Good for her," said the manager.  "It'll be a real nice affair.Do her good, too.  Has she ever had any experience?"
　　"Not a bit."
　　"Oh, well, it isn't anything very serious."
　　"She's clever, though," said Drouet, casting off any imputationagainst Carrie's ability.  "She picks up her part quick enough."
　　"You don't say so!" said the manager.
　　"Yes, sir; she surprised me the other night.  By George, if shedidn't."
　　"We must give her a nice little send-off," said the manager."I'll look after the flowers."
　　Drouet smiled at his good-nature.
　　"After the show you must come with me and we'll have a littlesupper."
　　"I think she'll do all right," said Drouet.
　　"I want to see her.  She's got to do all right.  We'll make her,"and the manager gave one of his quick, steely half-smiles, whichwas a compound of good-nature and shrewdness.
　　Carrie, meanwhile, attended the first rehearsal.  At thisperformance Mr. Quincel presided, aided by Mr. Millice, a youngman who had some qualifications of past experience, which werenot exactly understood by any one.  He was so experienced and sobusiness-like, however, that he came very near being rude--failing to remember, as he did, that the individuals he wastrying to instruct were volunteer players and not salariedunderlings.
　　"Now, Miss Madenda," he said, addressing Carrie, who stood in onepart uncertain as to what move to make, "you don't want to standlike that.  Put expression in your face.  Remember, you aretroubled over the intrusion of the stranger.  Walk so," and hestruck out across the Avery stage in almost drooping manner.
　　Carrie did not exactly fancy the suggestion, but the novelty ofthe situation, the presence of strangers, all more or lessnervous, and the desire to do anything rather than make afailure, made her timid.  She walked in imitation of her mentoras requested, inwardly feeling that there was something strangelylacking.
　　"Now, Mrs. Morgan," said the director to one young married womanwho was to take the part of Pearl, "you sit here.  Now, Mr.Bamberger, you stand here, so.  Now, what is it you say?"
　　"Explain," said Mr. Bamberger feebly.  He had the part of Ray,Laura's lover, the society individual who was to waver in histhoughts of marrying her, upon finding that she was a waif and anobody by birth.
　　"How is that--what does your text say?"
　　"Explain," repeated Mr. Bamberger, looking intently at his part.
　　"Yes, but it also says," the director remarked, "that you are tolook shocked.  Now, say it again, and see if you can't lookshocked."
　　"Explain!" demanded Mr. Bamberger vigorously.
　　"No, no, that won't do! Say it this way--EXPLAIN."
　　"Explain," said Mr. Bamberger, giving a modified imitation.
　　"That's better.  Now go on."
　　"One night," resumed Mrs. Morgan, whose lines came next, "fatherand mother were going to the opera.  When they were crossingBroadway, the usual crowd of children accosted them for alms--"
　　"Hold on," said the director, rushing forward, his arm extended."Put more feeling into what you are saying."
　　Mrs. Morgan looked at him as if she feared a personal assault.Her eye lightened with resentment.
　　"Remember, Mrs. Morgan," he added, ignoring the gleam, butmodifying his manner, "that you're detailing a pathetic story.You are now supposed to be telling something that is a grief toyou.  It requires feeling, repression, thus: 'The usual crowd ofchildren accosted them for alms.'"
　　"All right," said Mrs. Morgan.
　　"Now, go on."
　　"As mother felt in her pocket for some change, her fingerstouched a cold and trembling hand which had clutched her purse."
　　"Very good," interrupted the director, nodding his headsignificantly.
　　"A pickpocket! Well!" exclaimed Mr. Bamberger, speaking the linesthat here fell to him.
　　"No, no, Mr. Bamberger," said the director, approaching, "notthat way.  'A pickpocket--well?' so.  That's the idea."
　　"Don't you think," said Carrie weakly, noticing that it had notbeen proved yet whether the members of the company knew theirlines, let alone the details of expression, "that it would bebetter if we just went through our lines once to see if we knowthem? We might pick up some points."
　　"A very good idea, Miss Madenda," said Mr. Quincel, who sat atthe side of the stage, looking serenely on and volunteeringopinions which the director did not heed.
　　"All right," said the latter, somewhat abashed, "it might be wellto do it." Then brightening, with a show of authority, "Supposewe run right through, putting in as much expression as we can."
　　"Good," said Mr. Quincel.
　　"This hand," resumed Mrs. Morgan, glancing up at Mr. Bambergerand down at her book, as the lines proceeded, "my mother graspedin her own, and so tight that a small, feeble voice uttered anexclamation of pain.  Mother looked down, and there beside herwas a little ragged girl."
　　"Very good," observed the director, now hopelessly idle.
　　"The thief!" exclaimed Mr. Bamberger.
　　"Louder," put in the director, finding it almost impossible tokeep his hands off.
　　"The thief!" roared poor Bamberger.
　　"Yes, but a thief hardly six years old, with a face like anangel's.  'Stop,' said my mother.  'What are you doing?'
　　"'Trying to steal,' said the child.
　　"'Don't you know that it is wicked to do so?' asked my father.
　　"'No,' said the girl, 'but it is dreadful to be hungry.'
　　"'Who told you to steal?' asked my mother.
　　"'She--there,' said the child, pointing to a squalid woman in adoorway opposite, who fled suddenly down the street.  'That isold Judas,' said the girl."
　　Mrs. Morgan read this rather flatly, and the director was indespair.  He fidgeted around, and then went over to Mr. Quincel.
　　"What do you think of them?" he asked.
　　"Oh, I guess we'll be able to whip them into shape," said thelatter, with an air of strength under difficulties.
　　"I don't know," said the director.  "That fellow Bambergerstrikes me as being a pretty poor shift for a lover."
　　"He's all we've got," said Quincel, rolling up his eyes."Harrison went back on me at the last minute.  Who else can weget?"
　　"I don't know," said the director.  "I'm afraid he'll never pickup."
　　At this moment Bamberger was exclaiming, "Pearl, you are jokingwith me.""Look at that now," said the director, whispering behind hishand.  "My Lord! what can you do with a man who drawls out asentence like that?"
　　"Do the best you can," said Quincel consolingly.
　　The rendition ran on in this wise until it came to where Carrie,as Laura, comes into the room to explain to Ray, who, afterhearing Pearl's statement about her birth, had written the letterrepudiating her, which, however, he did not deliver.  Bambergerwas just concluding the words of Ray, "I must go before shereturns.  Her step! Too late," and was cramming the letter in hispocket, when she began sweetly with:
　　"Ray!"
　　"Miss--Miss Courtland," Bamberger faltered weakly.
　　Carrie looked at him a moment and forgot all about the companypresent.  She began to feel the part, and summoned an indifferentsmile to her lips, turning as the lines directed and going to awindow, as if he were not present.  She did it with a grace whichwas fascinating to look upon.
　　"Who is that woman?" asked the director, watching Carrie in herlittle scene with Bamberger.
　　"Miss Madenda," said Quincel.
　　"I know her name," said the director, "but what does she do?"
　　"I don't know," said Quincel.  "She's a friend of one of ourmembers."
　　"Well, she's got more gumption than any one I've seen here sofar--seems to take an interest in what she's doing."
　　"Pretty, too, isn't she?" said Quincel.
　　The director strolled away without answering.
　　In the second scene, where she was supposed to face the companyin the ball-room, she did even better, winning the smile of thedirector, who volunteered, because of her fascination for him, tocome over and speak with her.
　　"Were you ever on the stage?" he asked insinuatingly.
　　"No," said Carrie.
　　"You do so well, I thought you might have had some experience."
　　Carrie only smiled consciously.
　　He walked away to listen to Bamberger, who was feebly spoutingsome ardent line.
　　Mrs. Morgan saw the drift of things and gleamed at Carrie withenvious and snapping black eyes.
　　"She's some cheap professional," she gave herself thesatisfaction of thinking, and scorned and hated her accordingly.
　　The rehearsal ended for one day, and Carrie went home feelingthat she had acquitted herself satisfactorily.  The words of thedirector were ringing in her ears, and she longed for anopportunity to tell Hurstwood.  She wanted him to know just howwell she was doing.  Drouet, too, was an object for herconfidences.  She could hardly wait until he should ask her, andyet she did not have the vanity to bring it up.  The drummer,however, had another line of thought to-night, and her littleexperience did not appeal to him as important.  He let theconversation drop, save for what she chose to recite withoutsolicitation, and Carrie was not good at that.  He took it forgranted that she was doing very well and he was relieved offurther worry.  Consequently he threw Carrie into repression,which was irritating.  She felt his indifference keenly andlonged to see Hurstwood.  It was as if he were now the onlyfriend she had on earth.  The next morning Drouet was interestedagain, but the damage had been done.
　　She got a pretty letter from the manager, saying that by the timeshe got it he would be waiting for her in the park.  When shecame, he shone upon her as the morning sun.
　　"Well, my dear," he asked, "how did you come out?"
　　"Well enough," she said, still somewhat reduced after Drouet.
　　"Now, tell me just what you did.  Was it pleasant?"
　　Carrie related the incidents of the rehearsal, warming up as sheproceeded.
　　"Well, that's delightful," said Hurstwood.  "I'm so glad.  I mustget over there to see you.  When is the next rehearsal?"
　　"Tuesday," said Carrie, "but they don't allow visitors."
　　"I imagine I could get in," said Hurstwood significantly.
　　She was completely restored and delighted by his consideration,but she made him promise not to come around.
　　"Now, you must do your best to please me," he said encouragingly."Just remember that I want you to succeed.  We will make theperformance worth while.  You do that now."
　　"I'll try," said Carrie, brimming with affection and enthusiasm.
　　"That's the girl," said Hurstwood fondly.  "Now, remember,"shaking an affectionate finger at her, "your best."
　　"I will," she answered, looking back.
　　The whole earth was brimming sunshine that morning.  She trippedalong, the clear sky pouring liquid blue into her soul.  Oh,blessed are the children of endeavour in this, that they try andare hopeful.  And blessed also are they who, knowing, smile andapprove.
　　Chapter XVIII
　　JUST OVER THE BORDER--A HAIL AND FAREWELL
　　By the evening of the 16th the subtle hand of Hurstwood had madeitself apparent.  He had given the word among his friends--andthey were many and influential--that here was something whichthey ought to attend, and, as a consequence, the sale of ticketsby Mr. Quincel, acting for the lodge, had been large.  Smallfour-line notes had appeared in all of the daily newspapers.These he had arranged for by the aid of one of his newspaperfriends on the "Times," Mr. Harry McGarren, the managing editor.
　　"Say, Harry," Hurstwood said to him one evening, as the latterstood at the bar drinking before wending his belated wayhomeward, "you can help the boys out, I guess."
　　"What is it?" said McGarren, pleased to be consulted by theopulent manager.
　　"The Custer Lodge is getting up a little entertainment for theirown good, and they'd like a little newspaper notice.  You knowwhat I mean--a squib or two saying that it's going to takeplace."
　　"Certainly," said McGarren, "I can fix that for you, George."
　　At the same time Hurstwood kept himself wholly in the background.The members of Custer Lodge could scarcely understand why theirlittle affair was taking so well.  Mr. Harry Quincel was lookedupon as quite a star for this sort of work.
　　By the time the 16th had arrived Hurstwood's friends had ralliedlike Romans to a senator's call.  A well-dressed, good-natured,flatteringly-inclined audience was assured from the moment hethought of assisting Carrie.
　　That little student had mastered her part to her ownsatisfaction, much as she trembled for her fate when she shouldonce face the gathered throng, behind the glare of thefootlights.  She tried to console herself with the thought that ascore of other persons, men and women, were equally tremulousconcerning the outcome of their efforts, but she could notdisassociate the general danger from her own individualliability.  She feared that she would forget her lines, that shemight be unable to master the feeling which she now feltconcerning her own movements in the play.  At times she wishedthat she had never gone into the affair; at others, she trembledlest she should be paralysed with fear and stand white andgasping, not knowing what to say and spoiling the entireperformance.
　　In the matter of the company, Mr. Bamberger had disappeared.That hopeless example had fallen under the lance of thedirector's criticism.  Mrs. Morgan was still present, but enviousand determined, if for nothing more than spite, to do as well asCarrie at least.  A loafing professional had been called in toassume the role of Ray, and, while he was a poor stick of hiskind, he was not troubled by any of those qualms which attack thespirit of those who have never faced an audience.  He swashedabout (cautioned though he was to maintain silence concerning hispast theatrical relationships) in such a self-confident mannerthat he was like to convince every one of his identity by merematter of circumstantial evidence.
　　"It is so easy," he said to Mrs. Morgan, in the usual affectedstage voice.  "An audience would be the last thing to trouble me.It's the spirit of the part, you know, that is difficult."
　　Carrie disliked his appearance, but she was too much the actressnot to swallow his qualities with complaisance, seeing that shemust suffer his fictitious love for the evening.
　　At six she was ready to go.  Theatrical paraphernalia had beenprovided over and above her care.  She had practised her make-upin the morning, had rehearsed and arranged her material for theevening by one o'clock, and had gone home to have a final look ather part, waiting for the evening to come.
　　On this occasion the lodge sent a carriage.  Drouet rode with heras far as the door, and then went about the neighbouring stores,looking for some good cigars.  The little actress marchednervously into her dressing-room and began that painfullyanticipated matter of make-up which was to transform her, asimple maiden, to Laura, The Belle of Society.
　　The flare of the gas-jets, the open trunks, suggestive of traveland display, the scattered contents of the make-up box--rouge,pearl powder, whiting, burnt cork, India ink, pencils for theeye-lids, wigs, scissors, looking-glasses, drapery--in short, allthe nameless paraphernalia of disguise, have a remarkableatmosphere of their own.  Since her arrival in the city manythings had influenced her, but always in a far-removed manner.This new atmosphere was more friendly.  It was wholly unlike thegreat brilliant mansions which waved her coldly away, permittingher only awe and distant wonder.  This took her by the handkindly, as one who says, "My dear, come in." It opened for her asif for its own.  She had wondered at the greatness of the namesupon the bill-boards, the marvel of the long notices in thepapers, the beauty of the dresses upon the stage, the atmosphereof carriages, flowers, refinement.  Here was no illusion.  Herewas an open door to see all of that.  She had come upon it as onewho stumbles upon a secret passage and, behold, she was in thechamber of diamonds and delight!
　　As she dressed with a flutter, in her little stage room, hearingthe voices outside, seeing Mr. Quincel hurrying here and there,noting Mrs. Morgan and Mrs. Hoagland at their nervous work ofpreparation, seeing all the twenty members of the cast movingabout and worrying over what the result would be, she could nothelp thinking what a delight this would be if it would endure;how perfect a state, if she could only do well now, and then sometime get a place as a real actress.  The thought had taken amighty hold upon her.  It hummed in her ears as the melody of anold song.
　　Outside in the little lobby another scene was begin enacted.Without the interest of Hurstwood, the little hall would probablyhave been comfortably filled, for the members of the lodge weremoderately interested in its welfare.  Hurstwood's word, however,had gone the rounds.  It was to be a full-dress affair.  The fourboxes had been taken.  Dr. Norman McNeill Hale and his wife wereto occupy one.  This was quite a card.  C. R. Walker, dry-goodsmerchant and possessor of at least two hundred thousand dollars,had taken another; a well-known coal merchant had been induced totake the third, and Hurstwood and his friends the fourth.  Amongthe latter was Drouet.  The people who were now pouring here werenot celebrities, nor even local notabilities, in a general sense.They were the lights of a certain circle--the circle of smallfortunes and secret order distinctions.  These gentlemen Elksknew the standing of one another.  They had regard for theability which could amass a small fortune, own a nice home, keepa barouche or carriage, perhaps, wear fine clothes, and maintaina good mercantile position.  Naturally, Hurstwood, who was alittle above the order of mind which accepted this standard asperfect, who had shrewdness and much assumption of dignity, whoheld an imposing and authoritative position, and commandedfriendship by intuitive tact in handling people, was quite afigure.  He was more generally known than most others in the samecircle, and was looked upon as some one whose reserve covered amine of influence and solid financial prosperity.
　　To-night he was in his element.  He came with several friendsdirectly from Rector's in a carriage.  In the lobby he metDrouet, who was just returning from a trip for more cigars.  Allfive now joined in an animated conversation concerning thecompany present and the general drift of lodge affairs.
　　"Who's here?" said Hurstwood, passing into the theatre proper,where the lights were turned up and a company of gentlemen werelaughing and talking in the open space back of the seats.
　　"Why, how do you do, Mr. Hurstwood?" came from the firstindividual recognised.
　　"Glad to see you," said the latter, grasping his hand lightly.
　　"Looks quite an affair, doesn't it?"
　　"Yes, indeed," said the manager.
　　"Custer seems to have the backing of its members," observed thefriend.
　　"So it should," said the knowing manager.  "I'm glad to see it."
　　"Well, George," said another rotund citizen, whose avoirdupoismade necessary an almost alarming display of starched shirtbosom, "how goes it with you?"
　　"Excellent," said the manager.
　　"What brings you over here? You're not a member of Custer."
　　"Good-nature," returned the manager.  "Like to see the boys, youknow."
　　"Wife here?"
　　"She couldn't come to-night.  She's not well."
　　"Sorry to hear it--nothing serious, I hope."
　　"No, just feeling a little ill."
　　"I remember Mrs.  Hurstwood when she was travelling once with youover to St. Joe--" and here the newcomer launched off in atrivial recollection, which was terminated by the arrival of morefriends.
　　"Why, George, how are you?" said another genial West Sidepolitician and lodge member.  "My, but I'm glad to see you again;how are things, anyhow?"
　　"Very well; I see you got that nomination for alderman."
　　"Yes, we whipped them out over there without much trouble."
　　"What do you suppose Hennessy will do now?"
　　"Oh, he'll go back to his brick business.  He has a brick-yard,you know."
　　"I didn't know that," said the manager.  "Felt pretty sore, Isuppose, over his defeat.""Perhaps," said the other, winking shrewdly.
　　Some of the more favoured of his friends whom he had invitedbegan to roll up in carriages now.  They came shuffling in with agreat show of finery and much evident feeling of content andimportance.
　　"Here we are," said Hurstwood, turning to one from a group withwhom he was talking.
　　"That's right," returned the newcomer, a gentleman of aboutforty-five.
　　"And say," he whispered, jovially, pulling Hurstwood over by theshoulder so that he might whisper in his ear, "if this isn't agood show, I'll punch your head."
　　"You ought to pay for seeing your old friends.  Bother the show!"
　　To another who inquired, "Is it something really good?" themanager replied:
　　"I don't know.  I don't suppose so." Then, lifting his handgraciously, "For the lodge."
　　"Lots of boys out, eh?"
　　"Yes, look up Shanahan.  He was just asking for you a momentago."
　　It was thus that the little theatre resounded to a babble ofsuccessful voices, the creak of fine clothes, the commonplace ofgood-nature, and all largely because of this man's bidding.  Lookat him any time within the half hour before the curtain was up,he was a member of an eminent group--a rounded company of five ormore whose stout figures, large white bosoms, and shining pinsbespoke the character of their success.  The gentlemen whobrought their wives called him out to shake hands.  Seatsclicked, ushers bowed while he looked blandly on.  He wasevidently a light among them, reflecting in his personality theambitions of those who greeted him.  He was acknowledged, fawnedupon, in a way lionised.  Through it all one could see thestanding of the man.  It was greatness in a way, small as it was.
　　Chapter XIX
　　AN HOUR IN ELFLAND--A CLAMOUR HALF HEARD
　　At last the curtain was ready to go up.  All the details of themake-up had been completed, and the company settled down as theleader of the small, hired orchestra tapped significantly uponhis music rack with his baton and began the soft curtain-raisingstrain.  Hurstwood ceased talking, and went with Drouet and hisfriend Sagar Morrison around to the box.
　　"Now, we'll see how the little girl does," he said to Drouet, ina tone which no one else could hear.
　　On the stage, six of the characters had already appeared in theopening parlour scene.  Drouet and Hurstwood saw at a glance thatCarrie was not among them, and went on talking in a whisper.Mrs. Morgan, Mrs. Hoagland, and the actor who had takenBamberger's part were representing the principal roles in thisscene.  The professional, whose name was Patton, had little torecommend him outside of his assurance, but this at the presentmoment was most palpably needed.  Mrs. Morgan, as Pearl, wasstiff with fright.  Mrs. Hoagland was husky in the throat.  Thewhole company was so weak-kneed that the lines were merelyspoken, and nothing more.  It took all the hope and uncriticalgood-nature of the audience to keep from manifesting pity by thatunrest which is the agony of failure.
　　Hurstwood was perfectly indifferent.  He took it for granted thatit would be worthless.  All he cared for was to have it endurableenough to allow for pretension and congratulation afterward.
　　After the first rush of fright, however, the players got over thedanger of collapse.  They rambled weakly forward, losing nearlyall the expression which was intended, and making the thing dullin the extreme, when Carrie came in.
　　One glance at her, and both Hurstwood and Drouet saw plainly thatshe also was weak-kneed.  She came faintly across the stage,saying:
　　"And you, sir; we have been looking for you since eight o'clock,"but with so little colour and in such a feeble voice that it waspositively painful.
　　"She's frightened," whispered Drouet to Hurstwood.
　　The manager made no answer.
　　She had a line presently which was supposed to be funny.
　　"Well, that's as much as to say that I'm a sort of life pill."
　　It came out so flat, however, that it was a deathly thing.Drouet fidgeted.  Hurstwood moved his toe the least bit.
　　There was another place in which Laura was to rise and, with asense of impending disaster, say, sadly:
　　"I wish you hadn't said that, Pearl.  You know the old proverb,'Call a maid by a married name.'"
　　The lack of feeling in the thing was ridiculous.  Carrie did notget it at all.  She seemed to be talking in her sleep.  It lookedas if she were certain to be a wretched failure.  She was morehopeless than Mrs. Morgan, who had recovered somewhat, and wasnow saying her lines clearly at least.  Drouet looked away fromthe stage at the audience.  The latter held out silently, hopingfor a general change, of course.  Hurstwood fixed his eye onCarrie, as if to hypnotise her into doing better.  He was pouringdetermination of his own in her direction.  He felt sorry forher.
　　In a few more minutes it fell to her to read the letter sent inby the strange villain.  The audience had been slightly divertedby a conversation between the professional actor and a charactercalled Snorky, impersonated by a short little American, whoreally developed some humour as a half-crazed, one-armed soldier,turned messenger for a living.  He bawled his lines out with suchdefiance that, while they really did not partake of the humourintended, they were funny.  Now he was off, however, and it wasback to pathos, with Carrie as the chief figure.  She did notrecover.  She wandered through the whole scene between herselfand the intruding villain, straining the patience of theaudience, and finally exiting, much to their relief.
　　"She's too nervous," said Drouet, feeling in the mildness of theremark that he was lying for once.
　　"Better go back and say a word to her."
　　Drouet was glad to do anything for relief.  He fairly hustledaround to the side entrance, and was let in by the friendly door-keeper.  Carrie was standing in the wings, weakly waiting hernext cue, all the snap and nerve gone out of her.
　　"Say, Cad," he said, looking at her, "you mustn't be nervous.Wake up.  Those guys out there don't amount to anything.  Whatare you afraid of?"
　　"I don't know," said Carrie.  "I just don't seem to be able to doit."
　　She was grateful for the drummer's presence, though.  She hadfound the company so nervous that her own strength had gone.
　　"Come on," said Drouet.  "Brace up.  What are you afraid of? Goon out there now, and do the trick.  What do you care?"
　　Carrie revived a little under the drummer's electrical, nervouscondition.
　　"Did I do so very bad?"
　　"Not a bit.  All you need is a little more ginger.  Do it as youshowed me.  Get that toss of your head you had the other night."
　　Carrie remembered her triumph in the room.  She tried to thinkshe could to it.
　　'What's next?" he said, looking at her part, which she had beenstudying.
　　"Why, the scene between Ray and me when I refuse him."
　　"Well, now you do that lively," said the drummer.  "Put in snap,that's the thing.  Act as if you didn't care."
　　"Your turn next, Miss Madenda," said the prompter.
　　"Oh, dear," said Carrie.
　　"Well, you're a chump for being afraid," said Drouet.  "Come onnow, brace up.  I'll watch you from right here."
　　"Will you?" said Carrie.
　　"Yes, now go on.  Don't be afraid."
　　The prompter signalled her.
　　She started out, weak as ever, but suddenly her nerve partiallyreturned.  She thought of Drouet looking.
　　"Ray," she said, gently, using a tone of voice much more calmthan when she had last appeared.  It was the scene which hadpleased the director at the rehearsal.
　　"She's easier," thought Hurstwood to himself.
　　She did not do the part as she had at rehearsal, but she wasbetter.  The audience was at least not irritated.  Theimprovement of the work of the entire company took away directobservation from her.  They were making very fair progress, andnow it looked as if the play would be passable, in the lesstrying parts at least.
　　Carrie came off warm and nervous.
　　"Well," she said, looking at him, "was it any better?"
　　"Well, I should say so.  That's the way.  Put life into it.  Youdid that about a thousand per cent.  better than you did theother scene.  Now go on and fire up.  You can do it.  Knock 'em."
　　"Was it really better?"
　　"Better, I should say so.  What comes next?"
　　"That ballroom scene."
　　"Well, you can do that all right," he said.
　　"I don't know," answered Carrie.
　　"Why, woman," he exclaimed, "you did it for me! Now you go outthere and do it.  It'll be fun for you.  Just do as you did inthe room.  If you'll reel it off that way, I'll bet you make ahit.  Now, what'll you bet? You do it."
　　The drummer usually allowed his ardent good-nature to get thebetter of his speech.  He really did think that Carrie had actedthis particular scene very well, and he wanted her to repeat itin public.  His enthusiasm was due to the mere spirit of theoccasion.
　　When the time came, he buoyed Carrie up most effectually.  Hebegan to make her feel as if she had done very well.  The oldmelancholy of desire began to come back as he talked at her, andby the time the situation rolled around she was running high infeeling.
　　"I think I can do this."
　　"Sure you can.  Now you go ahead and see."
　　On the stage, Mrs. Van Dam was making her cruel insinuationagainst Laura.
　　Carrie listened, and caught the infection of something--she didnot know what.  Her nostrils sniffed thinly.
　　"It means," the professional actor began, speaking as Ray, "thatsociety is a terrible avenger of insult.  Have you ever heard ofthe Siberian wolves? When one of the pack falls through weakness,the others devour him.  It is not an elegant comparison, butthere is something wolfish in society.  Laura has mocked it witha pretence, and society, which is made up of pretence, willbitterly resent the mockery."
　　At the sound of her stage name Carrie started.  She began to feelthe bitterness of the situation.  The feelings of the outcastdescended upon her.  She hung at the wing's edge, wrapt in herown mounting thoughts.  She hardly heard anything more, save herown rumbling blood.
　　"Come, girls," said Mrs. Van Dam, solemnly, "let us look afterour things.  They are no longer safe when such an accomplishedthief enters."
　　"Cue," said the prompter, close to her side, but she did nothear.  Already she was moving forward with a steady grace, bornof inspiration.  She dawned upon the audience, handsome andproud, shifting, with the necessity of the situation, to a cold,white, helpless object, as the social pack moved away from herscornfully.
　　Hurstwood blinked his eyes and caught the infection.  Theradiating waves of feeling and sincerity were already breakingagainst the farthest walls of the chamber.  The magic of passion,which will yet dissolve the world, was here at work.
　　There was a drawing, too, of attention, a riveting of feeling,heretofore wandering.
　　"Ray! Ray! Why do you not come back to her?" was the cry ofPearl.
　　Every eye was fixed on Carrie, still proud and scornful.  Theymoved as she moved.  Their eyes were with her eyes.
　　Mrs. Morgan, as Pearl, approached her.
　　"Let us go home," she said.
　　"No," answered Carrie, her voice assuming for the first time apenetrating quality which it had never known.  "Stay with him!"
　　She pointed an almost accusing hand toward her lover.  Then, witha pathos which struck home because of its utter simplicity, "Heshall not suffer long."
　　Hurstwood realised that he was seeing something extraordinarilygood.  It was heightened for him by the applause of the audienceas the curtain descended and the fact that it was Carrie.  Hethought now that she was beautiful.  She had done something whichwas above his sphere.  He felt a keen delight in realising thatshe was his.
　　"Fine," he said, and then, seized by a sudden impulse, arose andwent about to the stage door.
　　When he came in upon Carrie she was still with Drouet.  Hisfeelings for her were most exuberant.  He was almost swept awayby the strength and feeling she exhibited.  His desire was topour forth his praise with the unbounded feelings of a lover, buthere was Drouet, whose affection was also rapidly reviving.  Thelatter was more fascinated, if anything, than Hurstwood.  Atleast, in the nature of things, it took a more ruddy form.
　　"Well, well," said Drouet, "you did out of sight.  That wassimply great.  I knew you could do it.  Oh, but you're a littledaisy!"
　　Carrie's eyes flamed with the light of achievement.
　　"Did I do all right?"
　　"Did you? Well, I guess.  Didn't you hear the applause?"
　　There was some faint sound of clapping yet.
　　"I thought I got it something like--I felt it."
　　Just then Hurstwood came in.  Instinctively he felt the change inDrouet.  He saw that the drummer was near to Carrie, and jealousyleaped alight in his bosom.  In a flash of thought, he reproachedhimself for having sent him back.  Also, he hated him as anintruder.  He could scarcely pull himself down to the level wherehe would have to congratulate Carrie as a friend.  Nevertheless,the man mastered himself, and it was a triumph.  He almost jerkedthe old subtle light to his eyes.
　　"I thought," he said, looking at Carrie, "I would come around andtell you how well you did, Mrs. Drouet.  It was delightful."
　　Carrie took the cue, and replied:
　　"Oh, thank you."
　　"I was just telling her," put in Drouet, now delighted with hispossession, "that I thought she did fine."
　　"Indeed you did," said Hurstwood, turning upon Carrie eyes inwhich she read more than the words.
　　Carrie laughed luxuriantly.
　　"If you do as well in the rest of the play, you will make us allthink you are a born actress."
　　Carrie smiled again.  She felt the acuteness of Hurstwood'sposition, and wished deeply that she could be alone with him, butshe did not understand the change in Drouet.  Hurstwood foundthat he could not talk, repressed as he was, and grudging Drouetevery moment of his presence, he bowed himself out with theelegance of a Faust.  Outside he set his teeth with envy.
　　"Damn it!" he said, "is he always going to be in the way?" He wasmoody when he got back to the box, and could not talk forthinking of his wretched situation.
　　As the curtain for the next act arose, Drouet came back.  He wasvery much enlivened in temper and inclined to whisper, butHurstwood pretended interest.  He fixed his eyes on the stage,although Carrie was not there, a short bit of melodramatic comedypreceding her entrance.  He did not see what was going on,however.  He was thinking his own thoughts, and they werewretched.
　　The progress of the play did not improve matters for him.Carrie, from now on, was easily the centre of interest.  Theaudience, which had been inclined to feel that nothing could begood after the first gloomy impression, now went to the otherextreme and saw power where it was not.  The general feelingreacted on Carrie.  She presented her part with some felicity,though nothing like the intensity which had aroused the feelingat the end of the long first act.
　　Both Hurstwood and Drouet viewed her pretty figure with risingfeelings.  The fact that such ability should reveal itself inher, that they should see it set forth under such effectivecircumstances, framed almost in massy gold and shone upon by theappropriate lights of sentiment and personality, heightened hercharm for them.  She was more than the old Carrie to Drouet.  Helonged to be at home with her until he could tell her.  Heawaited impatiently the end, when they should go home alone.
　　Hurstwood, on the contrary, saw in the strength of her newattractiveness his miserable predicament.  He could have cursedthe man beside him.  By the Lord, he could not even applaudfeelingly as he would.  For once he must simulate when it left ataste in his mouth.
　　It was in the last act that Carrie's fascination for her loversassumed its most effective character.
　　Hurstwood listened to its progress, wondering when Carrie wouldcome on.  He had not long to wait.  The author had used theartifice of sending all the merry company for a drive, and nowCarrie came in alone.  It was the first time that Hurstwood hadhad a chance to see her facing the audience quite alone, fornowhere else had she been without a foil of some sort.  Hesuddenly felt, as she entered, that her old strength--the powerthat had grasped him at the end of the first act--had come back.She seemed to be gaining feeling, now that the play was drawingto a close and the opportunity for great action was passing.
　　"Poor Pearl," she said, speaking with natural pathos.  "It is asad thing to want for happiness, but it is a terrible thing tosee another groping about blindly for it, when it is almostwithin the grasp."
　　She was gazing now sadly out upon the open sea, her arm restinglistlessly upon the polished door-post.
　　Hurstwood began to feel a deep sympathy for her and for himself.He could almost feel that she was talking to him.  He was, by acombination of feelings and entanglements, almost deluded by thatquality of voice and manner which, like a pathetic strain ofmusic, seems ever a personal and intimate thing.  Pathos has thisquality, that it seems ever addressed to one alone.
　　"And yet, she can be very happy with him," went on the littleactress.  "Her sunny temper, her joyous face will brighten anyhome."
　　She turned slowly toward the audience without seeing.  There wasso much simplicity in her movements that she seemed wholly alone.Then she found a seat by a table, and turned over some books,devoting a thought to them.
　　"With no longings for what I may not have," she breathed inconclusion--and it was almost a sigh--"my existence hidden fromall save two in the wide world, and making my joy out of the joyof that innocent girl who will soon be his wife."
　　Hurstwood was sorry when a character, known as Peach Blossom,interrupted her.  He stirred irritably, for he wished her to goon.  He was charmed by the pale face, the lissome figure, drapedin pearl grey, with a coiled string of pearls at the throat.Carrie had the air of one who was weary and in need ofprotection, and, under the fascinating make-believe of themoment, he rose in feeling until he was ready in spirit to go toher and ease her out of her misery by adding to his own delight.
　　In a moment Carrie was alone again, and was saying, withanimation:
　　"I must return to the city, no matter what dangers may lurk here.I must go, secretly if I can; openly, if I must."
　　There was a sound of horses' hoofs outside, and then Ray's voicesaying:"No, I shall not ride again.  Put him up."
　　He entered, and then began a scene which had as much to do withthe creation of the tragedy of affection in Hurstwood as anythingin his peculiar and involved career.  For Carrie had resolved tomake something of this scene, and, now that the cue had come, itbegan to take a feeling hold upon her.  Both Hurstwood and Drouetnoted the rising sentiment as she proceeded.
　　"I thought you had gone with Pearl," she said to her lover.
　　"I did go part of the way, but I left the Party a mile down theroad."
　　"You and Pearl had no disagreement?"
　　"No--yes; that is, we always have.  Our social barometers alwaysstand at 'cloudy' and 'overcast.'"
　　"And whose fault is that?" she said, easily.
　　"Not mine," he answered, pettishly.  "I know I do all I can--Isay all I can--but she----"
　　This was rather awkwardly put by Patton, but Carrie redeemed itwith a grace which was inspiring.
　　"But she is your wife," she said, fixing her whole attention uponthe stilled actor, and softening the quality of her voice untilit was again low and musical.  "Ray, my friend, courtship is thetext from which the whole sermon of married life takes its theme.Do not let yours be discontented and unhappy."
　　She put her two little hands together and pressed themappealingly.
　　Hurstwood gazed with slightly parted lips.  Drouet was fidgetingwith satisfaction.
　　"To be my wife, yes," went on the actor in a manner which wasweak by comparison, but which could not now spoil the tenderatmosphere which Carrie had created and maintained.  She did notseem to feel that he was wretched.  She would have done nearly aswell with a block of wood.  The accessories she needed werewithin her own imagination.  The acting of others could notaffect them.
　　"And you repent already?" she said, slowly.
　　"I lost you," he said, seizing her little hand, "and I was at themercy of any flirt who chose to give me an inviting look.  It wasyour fault--you know it was--why did you leave me?"
　　Carrie turned slowly away, and seemed to be mastering someimpulse in silence.  Then she turned back.
　　"Ray," she said, "the greatest happiness I have ever felt hasbeen the thought that all your affection was forever bestowedupon a virtuous woman, your equal in family, fortune, andaccomplishments.  What a revelation do you make to me now! Whatis it makes you continually war with your happiness?"
　　The last question was asked so simply that it came to theaudience and the lover as a personal thing.
　　At last it came to the part where the lover exclaimed, "Be to meas you used to be."
　　Carrie answered, with affecting sweetness, "I cannot be that toyou, but I can speak in the spirit of the Laura who is dead toyou forever."
　　"Be it as you will," said Patton.
　　Hurstwood leaned forward.  The whole audience was silent andintent.
　　"Let the woman you look upon be wise or vain," said Carrie, hereyes bent sadly upon the lover, who had sunk into a seat,"beautiful or homely, rich or poor, she has but one thing she canreally give or refuse--her heart."
　　Drouet felt a scratch in his throat.
　　"Her beauty, her wit, her accomplishments, she may sell to you;but her love is the treasure without money and without price."
　　The manager suffered this as a personal appeal.  It came to himas if they were alone, and he could hardly restrain the tears forsorrow over the hopeless, pathetic, and yet dainty and appealingwoman whom he loved.  Drouet also was beside himself.  He wasresolving that he would be to Carrie what he had never beenbefore.  He would marry her, by George! She was worth it.
　　"She asks only in return," said Carrie, scarcely hearing thesmall, scheduled reply of her lover, and putting herself evenmore in harmony with the plaintive melody now issuing from theorchestra, "that when you look upon her your eyes shall speakdevotion; that when you address her your voice shall be gentle,loving, and kind; that you shall not despise her because shecannot understand all at once your vigorous thoughts andambitious designs; for, when misfortune and evil have defeatedyour greatest purposes, her love remains to console you.  Youlook to the trees," she continued, while Hurstwood restrained hisfeelings only by the grimmest repression, "for strength andgrandeur; do not despise the flowers because their fragrance isall they have to give.  Remember," she concluded, tenderly, "loveis all a woman has to give," and she laid a strange, sweet accenton the all, "but it is the only thing which God permits us tocarry beyond the grave."
　　The two men were in the most harrowed state of affection.  Theyscarcely heard the few remaining words with which the sceneconcluded.  They only saw their idol, moving about with appealinggrace, continuing a power which to them was a revelation.
　　Hurstwood resolved a thousands things, Drouet as well.  Theyjoined equally in the burst of applause which called Carrie out.Drouet pounded his hands until they ached.  Then he jumped upagain and started out.  As he went, Carrie came out, and, seeingan immense basket of flowers being hurried down the aisle towardher she waited.  They were Hurstwood's.  She looked toward themanager's box for a moment, caught his eye, and smiled.  He couldhave leaped out of the box to enfold her.  He forgot the need ofcircumspectness which his married state enforced.  He almostforgot that he had with him in the box those who knew him.  Bythe Lord, he would have that lovely girl if it took his all.  Hewould act at once.  This should be the end of Drouet, and don'tyou forget it.  He would not wait another day.  The drummershould not have her.
　　He was so excited that he could not stay in the box.  He wentinto the lobby, and then into the street, thinking.  Drouet didnot return.  In a few minutes the last act was over, and he wascrazy to have Carrie alone.  He cursed the luck that could keephim smiling, bowing, shamming, when he wanted to tell her that heloved her, when he wanted to whisper to her alone.  He groaned ashe saw that his hopes were futile.  He must even take her tosupper, shamming.  He finally went about and asked how she wasgetting along.  The actors were all dressing, talking, hurryingabout.  Drouet was palavering himself with the looseness ofexcitement and passion.  The manager mastered himself only by agreat effort.
　　"We are going to supper, of course," he said, with a voice thatwas a mockery of his heart.
　　"Oh, yes," said Carrie, smiling.
　　The little actress was in fine feather.  She was realising nowwhat it was to be petted.  For once she was the admired, thesought-for.  The independence of success now made its first faintshowing.  With the tables turned, she was looking down, ratherthan up, to her lover.  She did not fully realise that this wasso, but there was something in condescension coming from herwhich was infinitely sweet.  When she was ready they climbed intothe waiting coach and drove down town; once, only, did she findan opportunity to express her feeling, and that was when themanager preceded Drouet in the coach and sat beside her.  BeforeDrouet was fully in she had squeezed Hurstwood's hand in agentle, impulsive manner.  The manager was beside himself withaffection.  He could have sold his soul to be with her alone."Ah," he thought, "the agony of it."
　　Drouet hung on, thinking he was all in all.  The dinner wasspoiled by his enthusiasm.  Hurstwood went home feeling as if heshould die if he did not find affectionate relief.  He whispered"to-morrow" passionately to Carrie, and she understood.  Hewalked away from the drummer and his prize at parting feeling asif he could slay him and not regret.  Carrie also felt the miseryof it.
　　"Good-night," he said, simulating an easy friendliness.
　　"Good-night," said the little actress, tenderly.
　　"The fool!" he said, now hating Drouet.  "The idiot! I'll do himyet, and that quick! We'll see to-morrow."
　　"Well, if you aren't a wonder," Drouet was saying, complacently,squeezing Carrie's arm.  "You are the dandiest little girl onearth."
　　Chapter XX
　　THE LURE OF THE SPIRIT--THE FLESH IN PURSUIT
　　Passion in a man of Hurstwood's nature takes a vigorous form.  Itis no musing, dreamy thing.  There is none of the tendency tosing outside of my lady's window--to languish and repine in theface of difficulties.  In the night he was long getting to sleepbecause of too much thinking, and in the morning he was earlyawake, seizing with alacrity upon the same dear subject andpursuing it with vigour.  He was out of sorts physically, as wellas disordered mentally, for did he not delight in a new manner inhis Carrie, and was not Drouet in the way? Never was man moreharassed than he by the thoughts of his love being held by theelated, flush-mannered drummer.  He would have given anything, itseemed to him, to have the complication ended--to have Carrieacquiesce to an arrangement which would dispose of Droueteffectually and forever.
　　What to do.  He dressed thinking.  He moved about in the samechamber with his wife, unmindful of her presence.
　　At breakfast he found himself without an appetite.  The meat towhich he helped himself remained on his plate untouched.  Hiscoffee grew cold, while he scanned the paper indifferently.  Hereand there he read a little thing, but remembered nothing.Jessica had not yet come down.  His wife sat at one end of thetable revolving thoughts of her own in silence.  A new servanthad been recently installed and had forgot the napkins.  On thisaccount the silence was irritably broken by a reproof.
　　"I've told you about this before, Maggie," said Mrs. Hurstwood."I'm not going to tell you again."
　　Hurstwood took a glance at his wife.  She was frowning.  Just nowher manner irritated him excessively.  Her next remark wasaddressed to him.
　　"Have you made up your mind, George, when you will take yourvacation?"
　　It was customary for them to discuss the regular summer outing atthis season of the year.
　　"Not yet," he said, "I'm very busy just now."
　　"Well, you'll want to make up your mind pretty soon, won't you,if we're going?" she returned.
　　"I guess we have a few days yet," he said.
　　"Hmff," she returned.  "Don't wait until the season's over."
　　She stirred in aggravation as she said this.
　　"There you go again," he observed.  "One would think I never didanything, the way you begin."
　　"Well, I want to know about it," she reiterated.
　　"You've got a few days yet," he insisted.  "You'll not want tostart before the races are over."
　　He was irritated to think that this should come up when he wishedto have his thoughts for other purposes.
　　"Well, we may.  Jessica doesn't want to stay until the end of theraces."
　　"What did you want with a season ticket, then?"
　　"Uh!" she said, using the sound as an exclamation of disgust,"I'll not argue with you," and therewith arose to leave thetable.
　　"Say," he said, rising, putting a note of determination in hisvoice which caused her to delay her departure, "what's the matterwith you of late? Can't I talk with you any more?"
　　"Certainly, you can TALK with me," she replied, laying emphasison the word.
　　"Well, you wouldn't think so by the way you act.  Now, you wantto know when I'll be ready--not for a month yet.  Maybe notthen."
　　"We'll go without you."
　　"You will, eh?" he sneered.
　　"Yes, we will."
　　He was astonished at the woman's determination, but it onlyirritated him the more.
　　"Well, we'll see about that.  It seems to me you're trying to runthings with a pretty high hand of late.  You talk as though yousettled my affairs for me.  Well, you don't.  You don't regulateanything that's connected with me.  If you want to go, go, butyou won't hurry me by any such talk as that."
　　He was thoroughly aroused now.  His dark eyes snapped, and hecrunched his paper as he laid it down.  Mrs. Hurstwood saidnothing more.  He was just finishing when she turned on her heeland went out into the hall and upstairs.  He paused for a moment,as if hesitating, then sat down and drank a little coffee, andthereafter arose and went for his hat and gloves upon the mainfloor.
　　His wife had really not anticipated a row of this character.  Shehad come down to the breakfast table feeling a little out ofsorts with herself and revolving a scheme which she had in hermind.  Jessica had called her attention to the fact that theraces were not what they were supposed to be.  The socialopportunities were not what they had thought they would be thisyear.  The beautiful girl found going every day a dull thing.There was an earlier exodus this year of people who were anybodyto the watering places and Europe.  In her own circle ofacquaintances several young men in whom she was interested hadgone to Waukesha.  She began to feel that she would like to gotoo, and her mother agreed with her.
　　Accordingly, Mrs. Hurstwood decided to broach the subject.  Shewas thinking this over when she came down to the table, but forsome reason the atmosphere was wrong.  She was not sure, after itwas all over, just how the trouble had begun.  She was determinednow, however, that her husband was a brute, and that, under nocircumstances, would she let this go by unsettled.  She wouldhave more lady-like treatment or she would know why.
　　For his part, the manager was loaded with the care of this newargument until he reached his office and started from there tomeet Carrie.  Then the other complications of love, desire, andopposition possessed him.  His thoughts fled on before him uponeagles' wings.  He could hardly wait until he should meet Carrieface to face.  What was the night, after all, without her--whatthe day? She must and should be his.
　　For her part, Carrie had experienced a world of fancy and feelingsince she had left him, the night before.  She had listened toDrouet's enthusiastic maunderings with much regard for that partwhich concerned herself, with very little for that which affectedhis own gain.  She kept him at such lengths as she could, becauseher thoughts were with her own triumph.  She felt Hurstwood'spassion as a delightful background to her own achievement, andshe wondered what he would have to say.  She was sorry for him,too, with that peculiar sorrow which finds somethingcomplimentary to itself in the misery of another.  She was nowexperiencing the first shades of feeling of that subtle changewhich removes one out of the ranks of the suppliants into thelines of the dispensers of charity.  She was, all in all,exceedingly happy.
　　On the morrow, however, there was nothing in the papersconcerning the event, and, in view of the flow of common,everyday things about, it now lost a shade of the glow of theprevious evening.  Drouet himself was not talking so much OF asFOR her.  He felt instinctively that, for some reason or other,he needed reconstruction in her regard.
　　"I think," he said, as he spruced around their chambers the nextmorning, preparatory to going down town, "that I'll straightenout that little deal of mine this month and then we'll getmarried.  I was talking with Mosher about that yesterday."
　　"No, you won't," said Carrie, who was coming to feel a certainfaint power to jest with the drummer.
　　"Yes, I will," he exclaimed, more feelingly than usual, adding,with the tone of one who pleads, "Don't you believe what I'vetold you?"
　　Carrie laughed a little.
　　"Of course I do," she answered.
　　Drouet's assurance now misgave him.  Shallow as was his mentalobservation, there was that in the things which had happenedwhich made his little power of analysis useless.  Carrie wasstill with him, but not helpless and pleading.  There was a liltin her voice which was new.  She did not study him with eyesexpressive of dependence.  The drummer was feeling the shadow ofsomething which was coming.  It coloured his feelings and madehim develop those little attentions and say those little wordswhich were mere forefendations against danger.
　　Shortly afterward he departed, and Carrie prepared for hermeeting with Hurstwood.  She hurried at her toilet, which wassoon made, and hastened down the stairs.  At the corner shepassed Drouet, but they did not see each other.
　　The drummer had forgotten some bills which he wished to turn intohis house.  He hastened up the stairs and burst into the room,but found only the chambermaid, who was cleaning up.
　　"Hello," he exclaimed, half to himself, "has Carrie gone?"
　　"Your wife? Yes, she went out just a few minutes ago."
　　"That's strange," thought Drouet.  "She didn't say a word to me.I wonder where she went?"
　　He hastened about, rummaging in his valise for what he wanted,and finally pocketing it.  Then he turned his attention to hisfair neighbour, who was good-looking and kindly disposed towardshim.
　　"What are you up to?" he said, smiling.
　　"Just cleaning," she replied, stopping and winding a dustingtowel about her hand.
　　"Tired of it?"
　　"Not so very."
　　"Let me show you something," he said, affably, coming over andtaking out of his pocket a little lithographed card which hadbeen issued by a wholesale tobacco company.  On this was printeda picture of a pretty girl, holding a striped parasol, thecolours of which could be changed by means of a revolving disk inthe back, which showed red, yellow, green, and blue throughlittle interstices made in the ground occupied by the umbrellatop.
　　"Isn't that clever?" he said, handing it to her and showing herhow it worked.  "You never saw anything like that before."
　　"Isn't it nice?" she answered.
　　"You can have it if you want it," he remarked.
　　"That's a pretty ring you have," he said, touching a commonplacesetting which adorned the hand holding the card he had given her.
　　"Do you think so?"
　　"That's right," he answered, making use of a pretence atexamination to secure her finger.  "That's fine."
　　The ice being thus broken, he launched into further observationpretending to forget that her fingers were still retained by his.She soon withdrew them, however, and retreated a few feet to restagainst the window-sill.
　　"I didn't see you for a long time," she said, coquettishly,repulsing one of his exuberant approaches.  "You must have beenaway."
　　"I was," said Drouet.
　　"Do you travel far?"
　　"Pretty far--yes."
　　"Do you like it?"
　　"Oh, not very well.  You get tired of it after a while."
　　"I wish I could travel," said the girl, gazing idly out of thewindow.
　　"What has become of your friend, Mr. Hurstwood?" she suddenlyasked, bethinking herself of the manager, who, from her ownobservation, seemed to contain promising material.
　　"He's here in town.  What makes you ask about him?"
　　"Oh, nothing, only he hasn't been here since you got back."
　　"How did you come to know him?"
　　"Didn't I take up his name a dozen times in the last month?"
　　"Get out," said the drummer, lightly.  "He hasn't called morethan half a dozen times since we've been here."
　　"He hasn't, eh?" said the girl, smiling.  "That's all you knowabout it."
　　Drouet took on a slightly more serious tone.  He was uncertain asto whether she was joking or not.
　　"Tease," he said, "what makes you smile that way?"
　　"Oh, nothing."
　　"Have you seen him recently?"
　　"Not since you came back," she laughed.
　　"Before?"
　　"Certainly."
　　"How often?"
　　"Why, nearly every day."
　　She was a mischievous newsmonger, and was keenly wondering whatthe effect of her words would be.
　　"Who did he come to see?" asked the drummer, incredulously.
　　"Mrs. Drouet."
　　He looked rather foolish at this answer, and then attempted tocorrect himself so as not to appear a dupe.
　　"Well," he said, "what of it?"
　　"Nothing," replied the girl, her head cocked coquettishly on oneside.
　　"He's an old friend," he went on, getting deeper into the mire.
　　He would have gone on further with his little flirtation, but thetaste for it was temporarily removed.  He was quite relieved whenthe girl's named was called from below.
　　"I've got to go," she said, moving away from him airily.
　　"I'll see you later," he said, with a pretence of disturbance atbeing interrupted.
　　When she was gone, he gave freer play to his feelings.  His face,never easily controlled by him, expressed all the perplexity anddisturbance which he felt.  Could it be that Carrie had receivedso many visits and yet said nothing about them? Was Hurstwoodlying? What did the chambermaid mean by it, anyway? He hadthought there was something odd about Carrie's manner at thetime.  Why did she look so disturbed when he had asked her howmany times Hurstwood had called? By George! He remembered now.There was something strange about the whole thing.
　　He sat down in a rocking-chair to think the better, drawing upone leg on his knee and frowning mightily.  His mind ran on at agreat rate.
　　And yet Carrie hadn't acted out of the ordinary.  It couldn't be,by George, that she was deceiving him.  She hadn't acted thatway.  Why, even last night she had been as friendly toward him ascould be, and Hurstwood too.  Look how they acted! He couldhardly believe they would try to deceive him.
　　His thoughts burst into words.
　　"She did act sort of funny at times.  Here she had dressed, andgone out this morning and never said a word."
　　He scratched his head and prepared to go down town.  He was stillfrowning.  As he came into the hall he encountered the girl, whowas now looking after another chamber.  She had on a whitedusting cap, beneath which her chubby face shone good-naturedly.Drouet almost forgot his worry in the fact that she was smilingon him.  He put his hand familiarly on her shoulder, as if onlyto greet her in passing.
　　"Got over being mad?" she said, still mischievously inclined.
　　"I'm not mad," he answered.
　　"I thought you were," she said, smiling.
　　"Quit your fooling about that," he said, in an offhand way."Were you serious?"
　　"Certainly," she answered.  Then, with an air of one who did notintentionally mean to create trouble, "He came lots of times.  Ithought you knew."
　　The game of deception was up with Drouet.  He did not try tosimulate indifference further.
　　"Did he spend the evenings here?" he asked.
　　"Sometimes.  Sometimes they went out."
　　"In the evening?"
　　"Yes.  You mustn't look so mad, though."
　　"I'm not," he said.  "Did any one else see him?"
　　"Of course," said the girl, as if, after all, it were nothing inparticular.
　　"How long ago was this?"
　　"Just before you came back."
　　The drummer pinched his lip nervously.
　　"Don't say anything, will you?" he asked, giving the girl's arm agentle squeeze.
　　"Certainly not," she returned.  "I wouldn't worry over it."
　　"All right," he said, passing on, seriously brooding for once,and yet not wholly unconscious of the fact that he was making amost excellent impression upon the chambermaid.
　　"I'll see her about that," he said to himself, passionately,feeling that he had been unduly wronged.  "I'll find out,b'George, whether she'll act that way or not."
　　Chapter XXI
　　THE LURE OF THE SPIRIT--THE FLESH IN PURSUIT
　　When Carrie came Hurstwood had been waiting many minutes.  Hisblood was warm; his nerves wrought up.  He was anxious to see thewoman who had stirred him so profoundly the night before.
　　"Here you are," he said, repressedly, feeling a spring in hislimbs and an elation which was tragic in itself.
　　"Yes," said Carrie.
　　They walked on as if bound for some objective point, whileHurstwood drank in the radiance of her presence.  The rustle ofher pretty skirt was like music to him.
　　"Are you satisfied?" he asked, thinking of how well she did thenight before.
　　"Are you?"
　　He tightened his fingers as he saw the smile she gave him.
　　"It was wonderful."
　　Carrie laughed ecstatically.
　　"That was one of the best things I've seen in a long time," headded.
　　He was dwelling on her attractiveness as he had felt it theevening before, and mingling it with the feeling her presenceinspired now.
　　Carrie was dwelling in the atmosphere which this man created forher.  Already she was enlivened and suffused with a glow.  Shefelt his drawing toward her in every sound of his voice.
　　"Those were such nice flowers you sent me," she said, after amoment or two.  "They were beautiful."
　　"Glad you liked them," he answered, simply.
　　He was thinking all the time that the subject of his desire wasbeing delayed.  He was anxious to turn the talk to his ownfeelings.  All was ripe for it.  His Carrie was beside him.  Hewanted to plunge in and expostulate with her, and yet he foundhimself fishing for words and feeling for a way.
　　"You got home all right," he said, gloomily, of a sudden, histune modifying itself to one of self-commiseration.
　　"Yes," said Carrie, easily.
　　He looked at her steadily for a moment, slowing his pace andfixing her with his eye.
　　She felt the flood of feeling.
　　"How about me?" he asked.
　　This confused Carrie considerably, for she realised the flood-gates were open.  She didn't know exactly what to answer."I don't know," she answered.
　　He took his lower lip between his teeth for a moment, and thenlet it go.  He stopped by the walk side and kicked the grass withhis toe.  He searched her face with a tender, appealing glance.
　　"Won't you come away from him?" he asked, intensely.
　　"I don't know," returned Carrie, still illogically drifting andfinding nothing at which to catch.
　　As a matter of fact, she was in a most hopeless quandary.  Herewas a man whom she thoroughly liked, who exercised an influenceover her, sufficient almost to delude her into the belief thatshe was possessed of a lively passion for him.  She was still thevictim of his keen eyes, his suave manners, his fine clothes.She looked and saw before her a man who was most gracious andsympathetic, who leaned toward her with a feeling that was adelight to observe.  She could not resist the glow of histemperament, the light of his eye.  She could hardly keep fromfeeling what he felt.
　　And yet she was not without thoughts which were disturbing.  Whatdid he know? What had Drouet told him? Was she a wife in hiseyes, or what? Would he marry her? Even while he talked, and shesoftened, and her eyes were lighted with a tender glow, she wasasking herself if Drouet had told him they were not married.There was never anything at all convincing about what Drouetsaid.
　　And yet she was not grieved at Hurstwood's love.  No strain ofbitterness was in it for her, whatever he knew.  He was evidentlysincere.  His passion was real and warm.  There was power in whathe said.  What should she do? She went on thinking this,answering vaguely, languishing affectionately, and altogetherdrifting, until she was on a borderless sea of speculation.
　　"Why don't you come away?" he said, tenderly.  "I will arrangefor you whatever--"
　　"Oh, don't," said Carrie.
　　"Don't what?" he asked.  "What do you mean?"
　　There was a look of confusion and pain in her face.  She waswondering why that miserable thought must be brought in.  She wasstruck as by a blade with the miserable provision which wasoutside the pale of marriage.
　　He himself realized that it was a wretched thing to have draggedin.  He wanted to weigh the effects of it, and yet he could notsee.  He went beating on, flushed by her presence, clearlyawakened, intensely enlisted in his plan.
　　"Won't you come?" he said, beginning over and with a morereverent feeling.  "You know I can't do without you--you know it--it can't go on this way--can it?"
　　"I know," said Carrie.
　　"I wouldn't ask if I--I wouldn't argue with you if I could helpit.  Look at me, Carrie.  Put yourself in my place.  You don'twant to stay away from me, do you?"
　　She shook her head as if in deep thought."Then why not settle the whole thing, once and for all?"
　　"I don't know," said Carrie.
　　"Don't know! Ah, Carrie, what makes you say that? Don't tormentme.  Be serious."
　　"I am," said Carrie, softly.
　　"You can't be, dearest, and say that.  Not when you know how Ilove you.  Look at last night."
　　His manner as he said this was the most quiet imaginable.  Hisface and body retained utter composure.  Only his eyes moved, andthey flashed a subtle, dissolving fire.  In them the wholeintensity of the man's nature was distilling itself.
　　Carrie made no answer.
　　"How can you act this way, dearest?" he inquired, after a time."You love me, don't you?"
　　He turned on her such a storm of feeling that she wasoverwhelmed.  For the moment all doubts were cleared away.
　　"Yes," she answered, frankly and tenderly.
　　"Well, then you'll come, won't you--come to-night?"
　　Carrie shook her head in spite of her distress.
　　"I can't wait any longer," urged Hurstwood.  "If that is toosoon, come Saturday."
　　"When will we be married?" she asked, diffidently, forgetting inher difficult situation that she had hoped he took her to beDrouet's wife.
　　The manager started, hit as he was by a problem which was moredifficult than hers.  He gave no sign of the thoughts thatflashed like messages to his mind.
　　"Any time you say," he said, with ease, refusing to discolour hispresent delight with this miserable problem.
　　"Saturday?" asked Carrie.
　　He nodded his head.
　　"Well, if you will marry me then," she said, "I'll go."
　　The manager looked at his lovely prize, so beautiful, so winsome,so difficult to be won, and made strange resolutions.  Hispassion had gotten to that stage now where it was no longercoloured with reason.  He did not trouble over little barriers ofthis sort in the face of so much loveliness.  He would accept thesituation with all its difficulties; he would not try to answerthe objections which cold truth thrust upon him.  He wouldpromise anything, everything, and trust to fortune to disentanglehim.  He would make a try for Paradise, whatever might be theresult.  He would be happy, by the Lord, if it cost all honestyof statement, all abandonment of truth.
　　Carrie looked at him tenderly.  She could have laid her head uponhis shoulder, so delightful did it all seem."Well," she said, "I'll try and get ready then."
　　Hurstwood looked into her pretty face, crossed with littleshadows of wonder and misgiving, and thought he had never seenanything more lovely.
　　"I'll see you again to-morrow," he said, joyously, "and we'lltalk over the plans."
　　He walked on with her, elated beyond words, so delightful hadbeen the result.  He impressed a long story of joy and affectionupon her, though there was but here and there a word.  After ahalf-hour he began to realise that the meeting must come to anend, so exacting is the world.
　　"To-morrow," he said at parting, a gayety of manner addingwonderfully to his brave demeanour.
　　"Yes," said Carrie, tripping elatedly away.
　　There had been so much enthusiasm engendered that she wasbelieving herself deeply in love.  She sighed as she thought ofher handsome adorer.  Yes, she would get ready by Saturday.  Shewould go, and they would be happy.
　　Chapter XXII
　　THE BLAZE OF THE TINDER--FLESH WARS WITH THE FLESH
　　The misfortune of the Hurstwood household was due to the factthat jealousy, having been born of love, did not perish with it.Mrs. Hurstwood retained this in such form that subsequentinfluences could transform it into hate.  Hurstwood was stillworthy, in a physical sense, of the affection his wife had oncebestowed upon him, but in a social sense he fell short.  With hisregard died his power to be attentive to her, and this, to awoman, is much greater than outright crime toward another.  Ourself-love dictates our appreciation of the good or evil inanother.  In Mrs. Hurstwood it discoloured the very hue of herhusband's indifferent nature.  She saw design in deeds andphrases which sprung only from a faded appreciation of herpresence.
　　As a consequence, she was resentful and suspicious.  The jealousythat prompted her to observe every falling away from the littleamenities of the married relation on his part served to give hernotice of the airy grace with which he still took the world.  Shecould see from the scrupulous care which he exercised in thematter of his personal appearance that his interest in life hadabated not a jot.  Every motion, every glance had something in itof the pleasure he felt in Carrie, of the zest this new pursuitof pleasure lent to his days.  Mrs. Hurstwood felt something,sniffing change, as animals do danger, afar off.
　　This feeling was strengthened by actions of a direct and morepotent nature on the part of Hurstwood.  We have seen with whatirritation he shirked those little duties which no longercontained any amusement of satisfaction for him, and the opensnarls with which, more recently, he resented her irritatinggoads.  These little rows were really precipitated by anatmosphere which was surcharged with dissension.  That it wouldshower, with a sky so full of blackening thunderclouds, wouldscarcely be thought worthy of comment.  Thus, after leaving thebreakfast table this morning, raging inwardly at his blankdeclaration of indifference at her plans, Mrs. Hurstwoodencountered Jessica in her dressing-room, very leisurelyarranging her hair.  Hurstwood had already left the house.
　　"I wish you wouldn't be so late coming down to breakfast," shesaid, addressing Jessica, while making for her crochet basket."Now here the things are quite cold, and you haven't eaten."
　　Her natural composure was sadly ruffled, and Jessica was doomedto feel the fag end of the storm.
　　"I'm not hungry," she answered.
　　"Then why don't you say so, and let the girl put away the things,instead of keeping her waiting all morning?"
　　"She doesn't mind," answered Jessica, coolly.
　　"Well, I do, if she doesn't," returned the mother, "and, anyhow,I don't like you to talk that way to me.  You're too young to puton such an air with your mother."
　　"Oh, mamma, don't row,"; answered Jessica.  "What's the matterthis morning, anyway?"
　　"Nothing's the matter, and I'm not rowing.  You mustn't thinkbecause I indulge you in some things that you can keep everybodywaiting.  I won't have it."
　　"I'm not keeping anybody waiting," returned Jessica, sharply,stirred out of a cynical indifference to a sharp defence.  "Isaid I wasn't hungry.  I don't want any breakfast."
　　"Mind how you address me, missy.  I'll not have it.  Hear me now;I'll not have it!"
　　Jessica heard this last while walking out of the room, with atoss of her head and a flick of her pretty skirts indicative ofthe independence and indifference she felt.  She did not proposeto be quarrelled with.
　　Such little arguments were all too frequent, the result of agrowth of natures which were largely independent and selfish.George, Jr., manifested even greater touchiness and exaggerationin the matter of his individual rights, and attempted to make allfeel that he was a man with a man's privileges--an assumptionwhich, of all things, is most groundless and pointless in a youthof nineteen.
　　Hurstwood was a man of authority and some fine feeling, and itirritated him excessively to find himself surrounded more andmore by a world upon which he had no hold, and of which he had alessening understanding.
　　Now, when such little things, such as the proposed earlier startto Waukesha, came up, they made clear to him his position.  Hewas being made to follow, was not leading.  When, in addition, asharp temper was manifested, and to the process of shoulderinghim out of his authority was added a rousing intellectual kick,such as a sneer or a cynical laugh, he was unable to keep histemper.  He flew into hardly repressed passion, and wishedhimself clear of the whole household.  It seemed a mostirritating drag upon all his desires and opportunities.
　　For all this, he still retained the semblance of leadership andcontrol, even though his wife was straining to revolt.  Herdisplay of temper and open assertion of opposition were basedupon nothing more than the feeling that she could do it.  She hadno special evidence wherewith to justify herself--the knowledgeof something which would give her both authority and excuse.  Thelatter was all that was lacking, however, to give a solidfoundation to what, in a way, seemed groundless discontent.  Theclear proof of one overt deed was the cold breath needed toconvert the lowering clouds of suspicion into a rain of wrath.
　　An inkling of untoward deeds on the part of Hurstwood had come.Doctor Beale, the handsome resident physician of theneighbourhood, met Mrs. Hurstwood at her own doorstep some daysafter Hurstwood and Carrie had taken the drive west on WashingtonBoulevard.  Dr. Beale, coming east on the same drive, hadrecognised Hurstwood, but not before he was quite past him.  Hewas not so sure of Carrie--did not know whether it wasHurstwood's wife or daughter.
　　"You don't speak to your friends when you meet them out driving,do you?" he said, jocosely, to Mrs. Hurstwood.
　　"If I see them, I do.  Where was I?"
　　"On Washington Boulevard." he answered, expecting her eye tolight with immediate remembrance.
　　She shook her head.
　　"Yes, out near Hoyne Avenue.  You were with your husband."
　　"I guess you're mistaken," she answered.  Then, remembering herhusband's part in the affair, she immediately fell a prey to ahost of young suspicions, of which, however, she gave no sign.
　　"I know I saw your husband," he went on.  "I wasn't so sure aboutyou.  Perhaps it was your daughter."
　　"Perhaps it was," said Mrs. Hurstwood, knowing full well thatsuch was not the case, as Jessica had been her companion forweeks.  She had recovered herself sufficiently to wish to knowmore of the details.
　　"Was it in the afternoon?" she asked, artfully, assuming an airof acquaintanceship with the matter.
　　"Yes, about two or three."
　　"It must have been Jessica," said Mrs. Hurstwood, not wishing toseem to attach any importance to the incident.
　　The physician had a thought or two of his own, but dismissed thematter as worthy of no further discussion on his part at least.
　　Mrs. Hurstwood gave this bit of information considerable thoughtduring the next few hours, and even days.  She took it forgranted that the doctor had really seen her husband, and that hehad been riding, most likely, with some other woman, afterannouncing himself as BUSY to her.  As a consequence, sherecalled, with rising feeling, how often he had refused to go toplaces with her, to share in little visits, or, indeed, take partin any of the social amenities which furnished the diversion ofher existence.  He had been seen at the theatre with people whomhe called Moy's friends; now he was seen driving, and, mostlikely, would have an excuse for that.  Perhaps there were othersof whom she did not hear, or why should he be so busy, soindifferent, of late? In the last six weeks he had becomestrangely irritable--strangely satisfied to pick up and go out,whether things were right or wrong in the house.  Why?
　　She recalled, with more subtle emotions, that he did not look ather now with any of the old light of satisfaction or approval inhis eye.  Evidently, along with other things, he was taking herto be getting old and uninteresting.  He saw her wrinkles,perhaps.  She was fading, while he was still preening himself inhis elegance and youth.  He was still an interested factor in themerry-makings of the world, while she--but she did not pursue thethought.  She only found the whole situation bitter, and hatedhim for it thoroughly.
　　Nothing came of this incident at the time, for the truth is itdid not seem conclusive enough to warrant any discussion.  Onlythe atmosphere of distrust and ill-feeling was strengthened,precipitating every now and then little sprinklings of irritableconversation, enlivened by flashes of wrath.  The matter of theWaukesha outing was merely a continuation of other things of thesame nature.
　　The day after Carrie's appearance on the Avery stage, Mrs.Hurstwood visited the races with Jessica and a youth of heracquaintance, Mr. Bart Taylor, the son of the owner of a localhouse-furnishing establishment.  They had driven out early, and,as it chanced, encountered several friends of Hurstwood, allElks, and two of whom had attended the performance the eveningbefore.  A thousand chances the subject of the performance hadnever been brought up had Jessica not been so engaged by theattentions of her young companion, who usurped as much time aspossible.  This left Mrs. Hurstwood in the mood to extend theperfunctory greetings of some who knew her into shortconversations, and the short conversations of friends into longones.  It was from one who meant but to greet her perfunctorilythat this interesting intelligence came.
　　"I see," said this individual, who wore sporting clothes of themost attractive pattern, and had a field-glass strung over hisshoulder, "that you did not get over to our little entertainmentlast evening."
　　"No?" said Mrs. Hurstwood, inquiringly, and wondering why heshould be using the tone he did in noting the fact that she hadnot been to something she knew nothing about.  It was on her lipsto say, "What was it?" when he added, "I saw your husband."
　　Her wonder was at once replaced by the more subtle quality ofsuspicion.
　　"Yes," she said, cautiously, "was it pleasant? He did not tell memuch about it."
　　"Very.  Really one of the best private theatricals I everattended.  There was one actress who surprised us all."
　　"Indeed," said Mrs. Hurstwood.
　　"It's too bad you couldn't have been there, really.  I was sorryto hear you weren't feeling well."
　　Feeling well! Mrs. Hurstwood could have echoed the words afterhim open-mouthed.  As it was, she extricated herself from hermingled impulse to deny and question, and said, almost raspingly:
　　"Yes, it is too bad."
　　"Looks like there will be quite a crowd here to-day, doesn't it?"the acquaintance observed, drifting off upon another topic.
　　The manager's wife would have questioned farther, but she saw noopportunity.  She was for the moment wholly at sea, anxious tothink for herself, and wondering what new deception was thiswhich caused him to give out that she was ill when she was not.Another case of her company not wanted, and excuses being made.She resolved to find out more.
　　"Were you at the performance last evening?" she asked of the nextof Hurstwood's friends who greeted her as she sat in her box.
　　"Yes.  You didn't get around."
　　"No," she answered, "I was not feeling very well."
　　"So your husband told me," he answered.  "Well, it was reallyvery enjoyable.  Turned out much better than I expected."
　　"Were there many there?"
　　"The house was full.  It was quite an Elk night.  I saw quite anumber of your friends--Mrs. Harrison, Mrs. Barnes, Mrs.Collins."
　　"Quite a social gathering."
　　"Indeed it was.  My wife enjoyed it very much."
　　Mrs. Hurstwood bit her lip.
　　"So," she thought, "that's the way he does.  Tells my friends Iam sick and cannot come."
　　She wondered what could induce him to go alone.  There wassomething back of this.  She rummaged her brain for a reason.
　　By evening, when Hurstwood reached home, she had brooded herselfinto a state of sullen desire for explanation and revenge.  Shewanted to know what this peculiar action of his imported.  Shewas certain there was more behind it all than what she had heard,and evil curiosity mingled well with distrust and the remnants ofher wrath of the morning.  She, impending disaster itself, walkedabout with gathered shadow at the eyes and the rudimentarymuscles of savagery fixing the hard lines of her mouth.
　　On the other hand, as we may well believe, the manager came homein the sunniest mood.  His conversation and agreement with Carriehad raised his spirits until he was in the frame of mind of onewho sings joyously.  He was proud of himself, proud of hissuccess, proud of Carrie.  He could have been genial to all theworld, and he bore no grudge against his wife.  He meant to bepleasant, to forget her presence, to live in the atmosphere ofyouth and pleasure which had been restored to him.
　　So now, the house, to his mind, had a most pleasing andcomfortable appearance.  In the hall he found an evening paper,laid there by the maid and forgotten by Mrs. Hurstwood.  In thedining-room the table was clean laid with linen and napery andshiny with glasses and decorated china.  Through an open door hesaw into the kitchen, where the fire was crackling in the stoveand the evening meal already well under way.  Out in the smallback yard was George, Jr., frolicking with a young dog he hadrecently purchased, and in the parlour Jessica was playing at thepiano, the sounds of a merry waltz filling every nook and cornerof the comfortable home.  Every one, like himself, seemed to haveregained his good spirits, to be in sympathy with youth andbeauty, to be inclined to joy and merry-making.  He felt as if hecould say a good word all around himself, and took a most genialglance at the spread table and polished sideboard before goingupstairs to read his paper in the comfortable armchair of thesitting-room which looked through the open windows into thestreet.  When he entered there, however, he found his wifebrushing her hair and musing to herself the while.
　　He came lightly in, thinking to smooth over any feeling thatmight still exist by a kindly word and a ready promise, but Mrs.Hurstwood said nothing.  He seated himself in the large chair,stirred lightly in making himself comfortable, opened his paper,and began to read.  In a few moments he was smiling merrily overa very comical account of a baseball game which had taken placebetween the Chicago and Detroit teams.
　　The while he was doing this Mrs. Hurstwood was observing himcasually through the medium of the mirror which was before her.She noticed his pleasant and contented manner, his airy grace andsmiling humour, and it merely aggravated her the more.  Shewondered how he could think to carry himself so in her presenceafter the cynicism, indifference, and neglect he had heretoforemanifested and would continue to manifest so long as she wouldendure it.  She thought how she should like to tell him--whatstress and emphasis she would lend her assertions, how she shoulddrive over this whole affair until satisfaction should berendered her.  Indeed, the shining sword of her wrath was butweakly suspended by a thread of thought.
　　In the meanwhile Hurstwood encountered a humorous item concerninga stranger who had arrived in the city and became entangled witha bunco-steerer.  It amused him immensely, and at last he stirredand chuckled to himself.  He wished that he might enlist hiswife's attention and read it to her.
　　"Ha, ha," he exclaimed softly, as if to himself, "that's funny."
　　Mrs. Hurstwood kept on arranging her hair, not so much asdeigning a glance.
　　He stirred again and went on to another subject.  At last he feltas if his good-humour must find some outlet.  Julia was probablystill out of humour over that affair of this morning, but thatcould easily be straightened.  As a matter of fact, she was inthe wrong, but he didn't care.  She could go to Waukesha rightaway if she wanted to.  The sooner the better.  He would tell herthat as soon as he got a chance, and the whole thing would blowover.
　　"Did you notice," he said, at last, breaking forth concerninganother item which he had found, "that they have entered suit tocompel the Illinois Central to get off the lake front, Julia?" heasked.
　　She could scarcely force herself to answer, but managed to say"No," sharply.
　　Hurstwood pricked up his ears.  There was a note in her voicewhich vibrated keenly.
　　"It would be a good thing if they did," he went on, half tohimself, half to her, though he felt that something was amiss inthat quarter.  He withdrew his attention to his paper verycircumspectly, listening mentally for the little sounds whichshould show him what was on foot.
　　As a matter of fact, no man as clever as Hurstwood--as observantand sensitive to atmospheres of many sorts, particularly upon hisown plane of thought--would have made the mistake which he did inregard to his wife, wrought up as she was, had he not beenoccupied mentally with a very different train of thought.  Hadnot the influence of Carrie's regard for him, the elation whichher promise aroused in him, lasted over, he would not have seenthe house in so pleasant a mood.  It was not extraordinarilybright and merry this evening.  He was merely very much mistaken,and would have been much more fitted to cope with it had he comehome in his normal state.
　　After he had studied his paper a few moments longer, he felt thathe ought to modify matters in some way or other.  Evidently hiswife was not going to patch up peace at a word.  So he said:
　　"Where did George get the dog he has there in the yard?"
　　"I don't know," she snapped.
　　He put his paper down on his knees and gazed idly out of thewindow.  He did not propose to lose his temper, but merely to bepersistent and agreeable, and by a few questions bring around amild understanding of some sort.
　　"Why do you feel so bad about that affair of this morning? hesaid, at last. "We needn't quarrel about that.  You know you cango to Waukesha if you want to."
　　"So you can stay here and trifle around with some one else?" sheexclaimed, turning to him a determined countenance upon which wasdrawn a sharp and wrathful sneer.
　　He stopped as if slapped in the face.  In an instant hispersuasive, conciliatory manner fled.  He was on the defensive ata wink and puzzled for a word to reply.
　　"What do you mean?" he said at last, straightening himself andgazing at the cold, determined figure before him, who paid noattention, but went on arranging herself before the mirror.
　　"You know what I mean," she said, finally, as if there were aworld of information which she held in reserve--which she did notneed to tell.
　　"Well, I don't," he said, stubbornly, yet nervous and alert forwhat should come next.  The finality of the woman's manner tookaway his feeling of superiority in battle.
　　She made no answer.
　　"Hmph!" he murmured, with a movement of his head to one side.  Itwas the weakest thing he had ever done.  It was totallyunassured.
　　Mrs. Hurstwood noticed the lack of colour in it.  She turned uponhim, animal-like, able to strike an effectual second blow.
　　"I want the Waukesha money to-morrow morning," she said.
　　He looked at her in amazement.  Never before had he seen such acold, steely determination in her eye--such a cruel look ofindifference.  She seemed a thorough master of her mood--thoroughly confident and determined to wrest all control fromhim.  He felt that all his resources could not defend him.  Hemust attack.
　　"What do you mean?" he said, jumping up.  "You want! I'd like toknow what's got into you to-night."
　　"Nothing's GOT into me," she said, flaming.  "I want that money.You can do your swaggering afterwards."
　　"Swaggering, eh! What! You'll get nothing from me.  What do youmean by your insinuations, anyhow?"
　　"Where were you last night?" she answered.  The words were hot asthey came.  "Who were you driving with on Washington Boulevard?Who were you with at the theatre when George saw you? Do youthink I'm a fool to be duped by you? Do you think I'll sit athome here and take your 'too busys' and 'can't come,' while youparade around and make out that I'm unable to come? I want you toknow that lordly airs have come to an end so far as I amconcerned.  You can't dictate to me nor my children.  I'm throughwith you entirely."
　　"It's a lie," he said, driven to a corner and knowing no otherexcuse.
　　"Lie, eh!" she said, fiercely, but with returning reserve; "youmay call it a lie if you want to, but I know."
　　"It's a lie, I tell you," he said, in a low, sharp voice."You've been searching around for some cheap accusation formonths and now you think you have it.  You think you'll springsomething and get the upper hand.  Well, I tell you, you can't.As long as I'm in this house I'm master of it, and you or any oneelse won't dictate to me--do you hear?"
　　He crept toward her with a light in his eye that was ominous.Something in the woman's cool, cynical, upper-handish manner, asif she were already master, caused him to feel for the moment asif he could strangle her.
　　She gazed at him--a pythoness in humour.
　　"I'm not dictating to you," she returned; "I'm telling you what Iwant."
　　The answer was so cool, so rich in bravado, that somehow it tookthe wind out of his sails.  He could not attack her, he could notask her for proofs.  Somehow he felt evidence, law, theremembrance of all his property which she held in her name, to beshining in her glance.  He was like a vessel, powerful anddangerous, but rolling and floundering without sail.
　　"And I'm telling you," he said in the end, slightly recoveringhimself, "what you'll not get."
　　"We'll see about it," she said.  "I'll find out what my rightsare.  Perhaps you'll talk to a lawyer, if you won't to me."
　　It was a magnificent play, and had its effect.  Hurstwood fellback beaten.  He knew now that he had more than mere bluff tocontend with.  He felt that he was face to face with a dullproposition.  What to say he hardly knew.  All the merriment hadgone out of the day.  He was disturbed, wretched, resentful.What should he do?"Do as you please," he said, at last.  "I'll have nothing more todo with you," and out he strode.
　　Chapter XXIII
　　A SPIRIT IN TRAVAIL--ONE RUNG PUT BEHIND
　　When Carrie reached her own room she had already fallen a prey tothose doubts and misgivings which are ever the result of a lackof decision.  She could not persuade herself as to theadvisability of her promise, or that now, having given her word,she ought to keep it.  She went over the whole ground inHurstwood's absence, and discovered little objections that hadnot occurred to her in the warmth of the manager's argument.  Shesaw where she had put herself in a peculiar light, namely, thatof agreeing to marry when she was already supposedly married.She remembered a few things Drouet had done, and now that it cameto walking away from him without a word, she felt as if she weredoing wrong.  Now, she was comfortably situated, and to one whois more or less afraid of the world, this is an urgent matter,and one which puts up strange, uncanny arguments.  "You do notknow what will come.  There are miserable things outside.  Peoplego a-begging.  Women are wretched.  You never can tell what willhappen.  Remember the time you were hungry.  Stick to what youhave."
　　Curiously, for all her leaning towards Hurstwood, he had nottaken a firm hold on her understanding.  She was listening,smiling, approving, and yet not finally agreeing.  This was dueto a lack of power on his part, a lack of that majesty of passionthat sweeps the mind from its seat, fuses and melts all argumentsand theories into a tangled mass, and destroys for the time beingthe reasoning power.  This majesty of passion is possessed bynearly every man once in his life, but it is usually an attributeof youth and conduces to the first successful mating.
　　Hurstwood, being an older man, could scarcely be said to retainthe fire of youth, though he did possess a passion warm andunreasoning.  It was strong enough to induce the leaning towardhim which, on Carrie's part, we have seen.  She might have beensaid to be imagining herself in love, when she was not.  Womenfrequently do this.  It flows from the fact that in each exists abias toward affection, a craving for the pleasure of being loved.The longing to be shielded, bettered, sympathised with, is one ofthe attributes of the sex.  This, coupled with sentiment and anatural tendency to emotion, often makes refusing difficult.  Itpersuades them that they are in love.
　　Once at home, she changed her clothes and straightened the roomsfor herself.  In the matter of the arrangement of the furnitureshe never took the housemaid's opinion.  That young womaninvariably put one of the rocking-chairs in the corner, andCarrie as regularly moved it out.  To-day she hardly noticed thatit was in the wrong place, so absorbed was she in her ownthoughts.  She worked about the room until Drouet put inappearance at five o'clock.  The drummer was flushed and excitedand full of determination to know all about her relations withHurstwood.  Nevertheless, after going over the subject in hismind the livelong day, he was rather weary of it and wished itover with.  He did not foresee serious consequences of any sort,and yet he rather hesitated to begin.  Carrie was sitting by thewindow when he came in, rocking and looking out."Well," she said innocently, weary of her own mental discussionand wondering at his haste and ill-concealed excitement, "whatmakes you hurry so?"
　　Drouet hesitated, now that he was in her presence, uncertain asto what course to pursue.  He was no diplomat.  He could neitherread nor see.
　　"When did you get home?" he asked foolishly.
　　"Oh, an hour or so ago.  What makes you ask that?"
　　"You weren't here," he said, "when I came back this morning, andI thought you had gone out."
　　"So I did," said Carrie simply.  "I went for a walk."
　　Drouet looked at her wonderingly.  For all his lack of dignity insuch matters he did not know how to begin.  He stared at her inthe most flagrant manner until at last she said:
　　"What makes you stare at me so? What's the matter?"
　　"Nothing," he answered.  "I was just thinking."
　　"Just thinking what?" she returned smilingly, puzzled by hisattitude.
　　"Oh, nothing--nothing much."
　　"Well, then, what makes you look so?"
　　Drouet was standing by the dresser, gazing at her in a comicmanner.  He had laid off his hat and gloves and was now fidgetingwith the little toilet pieces which were nearest him.  Hehesitated to believe that the pretty woman before him wasinvolved in anything so unsatisfactory to himself.  He was verymuch inclined to feel that it was all right, after all.  Yet theknowledge imparted to him by the chambermaid was rankling in hismind.  He wanted to plunge in with a straight remark of somesort, but he knew not what.
　　"Where did you go this morning?" he finally asked weakly.
　　"Why, I went for a walk," said Carrie.
　　"Sure you did?" he asked.
　　"Yes, what makes you ask?"
　　She was beginning to see now that he knew something.  Instantlyshe drew herself into a more reserved position.  Her cheeksblanched slightly.
　　"I thought maybe you didn't," he said, beating about the bush inthe most useless manner.
　　Carrie gazed at him, and as she did so her ebbing courage halted.She saw that he himself was hesitating, and with a woman'sintuition realised that there was no occasion for great alarm.
　　"What makes you talk like that?" she asked, wrinkling her prettyforehead.  "You act so funny to-night."
　　"I feel funny," he answered.They looked at one another for a moment, and then Drouet plungeddesperately into his subject.
　　"What's this about you and Hurstwood?" he asked.
　　"Me and Hurstwood--what do you mean?"
　　"Didn't he come here a dozen times while I was away?"
　　"A dozen times," repeated Carrie, guiltily.  "No, but what do youmean?"
　　"Somebody said that you went out riding with him and that he camehere every night."
　　"No such thing," answered Carrie.  "It isn't true.  Who told youthat?"
　　She was flushing scarlet to the roots of her hair, but Drouet didnot catch the full hue of her face, owing to the modified lightof the room.  He was regaining much confidence as Carrie defendedherself with denials.
　　"Well, some one," he said.  "You're sure you didn't?"
　　"Certainly," said Carrie.  "You know how often he came."
　　Drouet paused for a moment and thought.
　　"I know what you told me," he said finally.
　　He moved nervously about, while Carrie looked at him confusedly.
　　"Well, I know that I didn't tell you any such thing as that,"said Carrie, recovering herself.
　　"If I were you," went on Drouet, ignoring her last remark, "Iwouldn't have anything to do with him.  He's a married man, youknow."
　　"Who--who is?" said Carrie, stumbling at the word.
　　"Why, Hurstwood," said Drouet, noting the effect and feeling thathe was delivering a telling blow.
　　"Hurstwood!" exclaimed Carrie, rising.  Her face had changedseveral shades since this announcement was made.  She lookedwithin and without herself in a half-dazed way.
　　"Who told you this?" she asked, forgetting that her interest wasout of order and exceedingly incriminating.
　　"Why, I know it.  I've always known it," said Drouet.
　　Carrie was feeling about for a right thought.  She was making amost miserable showing, and yet feelings were generating withinher which were anything but crumbling cowardice.
　　"I thought I told you," he added.
　　"No, you didn't," she contradicted, suddenly recovering hervoice.  "You didn't do anything of the kind."
　　Drouet listened to her in astonishment.  This was something new.
　　"I thought I did," he said.
　　Carrie looked around her very solemnly, and then went over to thewindow.
　　"You oughtn't to have had anything to do with him," said Drouetin an injured tone, "after all I've done for you."
　　"You," said Carrie, "you! What have you done for me?"
　　Her little brain had been surging with contradictory feelings--shame at exposure, shame at Hurstwood's perfidy, anger atDrouet's deception, the mockery he had made at her.  Now oneclear idea came into her head.  He was at fault.  There was nodoubt about it.  Why did he bring Hurstwood out--Hurstwood, amarried man, and never say a word to her? Never mind now aboutHurstwood's perfidy--why had he done this? Why hadn't he warnedher? There he stood now, guilty of this miserable breach ofconfidence and talking about what he had done for her!
　　"Well, I like that," exclaimed Drouet, little realising the firehis remark had generated.  "I think I've done a good deal."
　　"You have, eh?" she answered.  "You've deceived me--that's whatyou've done.  You've brought your old friends out here underfalse pretences.  You've made me out to be--Oh," and with thisher voice broke and she pressed her two little hands togethertragically.
　　"I don't see what that's got to do with it," said the drummerquaintly.
　　"No," she answered, recovering herself and shutting her teeth."No, of course you don't see.  There isn't anything you see.  Youcouldn't have told me in the first place, could you? You had tomake me out wrong until it was too late.  Now you come sneakingaround with your information and your talk about what you havedone."
　　Drouet had never suspected this side of Carrie's nature.  She wasalive with feeling, her eyes snapping, her lips quivering, herwhole body sensible of the injury she felt, and partaking of herwrath.
　　"Who's sneaking?" he asked, mildly conscious of error on hispart, but certain that he was wronged.
　　"You are," stamped Carrie.  "You're a horrid, conceited coward,that's what you are.  If you had any sense of manhood in you, youwouldn't have thought of doing any such thing."
　　The drummer stared.
　　"I'm not a coward," he said.  "What do you mean by going withother men, anyway?"
　　"Other men!" exclaimed Carrie.  "Other men--you know better thanthat.  I did go with Mr. Hurstwood, but whose fault was it?Didn't you bring him here? You told him yourself that he shouldcome out here and take me out.  Now, after it's all over, youcome and tell me that I oughtn't to go with him and that he's amarried man."
　　She paused at the sound of the last two words and wrung herhands.  The knowledge of Hurstwood's perfidy wounded her like aknife."Oh," she sobbed, repressing herself wonderfully and keeping hereyes dry.  "Oh, oh!"
　　"Well, I didn't think you'd be running around with him when I wasaway," insisted Drouet.
　　"Didn't think!" said Carrie, now angered to the core by the man'speculiar attitude.  "Of course not.  You thought only of whatwould be to your satisfaction.  You thought you'd make a toy ofme--a plaything.  Well, I'll show you that you won't.  I'll havenothing more to do with you at all.  You can take your old thingsand keep them," and unfastening a little pin he had given her,she flung it vigorously upon the floor and began to move about asif to gather up the things which belonged to her.
　　By this Drouet was not only irritated but fascinated the more.He looked at her in amazement, and finally said:
　　"I don't see where your wrath comes in.  I've got the right ofthis thing.  You oughtn't to have done anything that wasn't rightafter all I did for you."
　　"What have you done for me?" asked Carrie blazing, her headthrown back and her lips parted.
　　"I think I've done a good deal," said the drummer, lookingaround.  "I've given you all the clothes you wanted, haven't I?I've taken you everywhere you wanted to go.  You've had as muchas I've had, and more too."
　　Carrie was not ungrateful, whatever else might be said of her.In so far as her mind could construe, she acknowledged benefitsreceived.  She hardly knew how to answer this, and yet her wrathwas not placated.  She felt that the drummer had injured herirreparably.
　　"Did I ask you to?" she returned.
　　"Well, I did it," said Drouet, "and you took it."
　　"You talk as though I had persuaded you," answered Carrie.  "Youstand there and throw up what you've done.  I don't want your oldthings.  I'll not have them.  You take them to-night and do whatyou please with them.  I'll not stay here another minute."
　　"That's nice!" he answered, becoming angered now at the sense ofhis own approaching loss.  "Use everything and abuse me and thenwalk off.  That's just like a woman.  I take you when you haven'tgot anything, and then when some one else comes along, why I'm nogood.  I always thought it'd come out that way."
　　He felt really hurt as he thought of his treatment, and looked asif he saw no way of obtaining justice.
　　"It's not so," said Carrie, "and I'm not going with anybody else.You have been as miserable and inconsiderate as you can be.  Ihate you, I tell you, and I wouldn't live with you anotherminute.  You're a big, insulting"--here she hesitated and used noword at all--"or you wouldn't talk that way."
　　She had secured her hat and jacket and slipped the latter on overher little evening dress.  Some wisps of wavy hair had loosenedfrom the bands at the side of her head and were straggling overher hot, red cheeks.  She was angry, mortified, grief-stricken.Her large eyes were full of the anguish of tears, but her lidswere not yet wet.  She was distracted and uncertain, deciding anddoing things without an aim or conclusion, and she had not theslightest conception of how the whole difficulty would end.
　　"Well, that's a fine finish," said Drouet.  "Pack up and pullout, eh? You take the cake.  I bet you were knocking around withHurstwood or you wouldn't act like that.  I don't want the oldrooms.  You needn't pull out for me.  You can have them for all Icare, but b'George, you haven't done me right."
　　"I'll not live with you," said Carrie.  "I don't want to livewith you.  You've done nothing but brag around ever since you'vebeen here."
　　"Aw, I haven't anything of the kind," he answered.
　　Carrie walked over to the door.
　　"Where are you going?" he said, stepping over and heading heroff.
　　"Let me out," she said.
　　"Where are you going?" he repeated.
　　He was, above all, sympathetic, and the sight of Carrie wanderingout, he knew not where, affected him, despite his grievance.
　　Carrie merely pulled at the door.
　　The strain of the situation was too much for her, however.  Shemade one more vain effort and then burst into tears.
　　"Now, be reasonable, Cad," said Drouet gently.  "What do you wantto rush out for this way? You haven't any place to go.  Why notstay here now and be quiet? I'll not bother you.  I don't want tostay here any longer."
　　Carrie had gone sobbing from the door to the window.  She was soovercome she could not speak.
　　"Be reasonable now," he said.  "I don't want to hold you.  Youcan go if you want to, but why don't you think it over? Lordknows, I don't want to stop you."
　　He received no answer.  Carrie was quieting, however, under theinfluence of his plea.
　　"You stay here now, and I'll go," he added at last.
　　Carrie listened to this with mingled feelings.  Her mind wasshaken loose from the little mooring of logic that it had.  Shewas stirred by this thought, angered by that--her own injustice,Hurstwood's, Drouet's, their respective qualities of kindness andfavour, the threat of the world outside, in which she had failedonce before, the impossibility of this state inside, where thechambers were no longer justly hers, the effect of the argumentupon her nerves, all combined to make her a mass of janglingfibres--an anchorless, storm-beaten little craft which could doabsolutely nothing but drift.
　　"Say," said Drouet, coming over to her after a few moments, witha new idea, and putting his hand upon her.
　　"Don't!" said Carrie, drawing away, but not removing herhandkerchief from her eyes."Never mind about this quarrel now.  Let it go.  You stay hereuntil the month's out, anyhow, and then you can tell better whatyou want to do.  Eh?"
　　Carrie made no answer.
　　"You'd better do that," he said.  "There's no use your packing upnow.  You can't go anywhere."
　　Still he got nothing for his words.
　　"If you'll do that, we'll call it off for the present and I'llget out."
　　Carrie lowered her handkerchief slightly and looked out of thewindow.
　　"Will you do that?" he asked.
　　Still no answer.
　　"Will you?" he repeated.
　　She only looked vaguely into the street.
　　"Aw! come on," he said, "tell me.  Will you?"
　　"I don't know," said Carrie softly, forced to answer.
　　"Promise me you'll do that," he said, "and we'll quit talkingabout it.  It'll be the best thing for you."
　　Carrie heard him, but she could not bring herself to answerreasonably.  She felt that the man was gentle, and that hisinterest in her had not abated, and it made her suffer a pang ofregret.  She was in a most helpless plight.
　　As for Drouet, his attitude had been that of the jealous lover.Now his feelings were a mixture of anger at deception, sorrow atlosing Carrie, misery at being defeated.  He wanted his rights insome way or other, and yet his rights included the retaining ofCarrie, the making her feel her error.
　　"Will you?" he urged.
　　"Well, I'll see," said Carrie.
　　This left the matter as open as before, but it was something.  Itlooked as if the quarrel would blow over, if they could only getsome way of talking to one another.  Carrie was ashamed, andDrouet aggrieved.  He pretended to take up the task of packingsome things in a valise.
　　Now, as Carrie watched him out of the corner of her eye, certainsound thoughts came into her head.  He had erred, true, but whathad she done? He was kindly and good-natured for all his egotism.Throughout this argument he had said nothing very harsh.  On theother hand, there was Hurstwood--a greater deceiver than he.  Hehad pretended all this affection, all this passion, and he waslying to her all the while.  Oh, the perfidy of men! And she hadloved him.  There could be nothing more in that quarter.  Shewould see Hurstwood no more.  She would write him and let himknow what she thought.  Thereupon what would she do? Here werethese rooms.  Here was Drouet, pleading for her to remain.Evidently things could go on here somewhat as before, if all werearranged.  It would be better than the street, without a place tolay her head.
　　All this she thought of as Drouet rummaged the drawers forcollars and laboured long and painstakingly at finding a shirt-stud.  He was in no hurry to rush this matter.  He felt anattraction to Carrie which would not down.  He could not thinkthat the thing would end by his walking out of the room.  Theremust be some way round, some way to make her own up that he wasright and she was wrong--to patch up a peace and shut outHurstwood for ever.  Mercy, how he turned at the man's shamelessduplicity.
　　"Do you think," he said, after a few moments' silence, "thatyou'll try and get on the stage?"
　　He was wondering what she was intending.
　　"I don't know what I'll do yet," said Carrie.
　　"If you do, maybe I can help you.  I've got a lot of friends inthat line."
　　She made no answer to this.
　　"Don't go and try to knock around now without any money.  Let mehelp you," he said.  "It's no easy thing to go on your own hookhere."
　　Carrie only rocked back and forth in her chair.
　　"I don't want you to go up against a hard game that way."
　　He bestirred himself about some other details and Carrie rockedon.
　　"Why don't you tell me all about this thing," he said, after atime, "and let's call it off? You don't really care forHurstwood, do you?"
　　"Why do you want to start on that again?" said Carrie.  "You wereto blame."
　　"No, I wasn't," he answered.
　　"Yes, you were, too," said Carrie.  "You shouldn't have ever toldme such a story as that."
　　"But you didn't have much to do with him, did you?" went onDrouet, anxious for his own peace of mind to get some directdenial from her.
　　"I won't talk about it," said Carrie, pained at the quizzicalturn the peace arrangement had taken.
　　"What's the use of acting like that now, Cad?" insisted thedrummer, stopping in his work and putting up a hand expressively."You might let me know where I stand, at least."
　　"I won't," said Carrie, feeling no refuge but in anger."Whatever has happened is your own fault."
　　"Then you do care for him?" said Drouet, stopping completely andexperiencing a rush of feeling.
　　"Oh, stop!" said Carrie."Well, I'll not be made a fool of," exclaimed Drouet.  "You maytrifle around with him if you want to, but you can't lead me.You can tell me or not, just as you want to, but I won't fool anylonger!"
　　He shoved the last few remaining things he had laid out into hisvalise and snapped it with a vengeance.  Then he grabbed hiscoat, which he had laid off to work, picked up his gloves, andstarted out.
　　"You can go to the deuce as far as I am concerned," he said, ashe reached the door.  "I'm no sucker," and with that he opened itwith a jerk and closed it equally vigorously.
　　Carrie listened at her window view, more astonished than anythingelse at this sudden rise of passion in the drummer.  She couldhardly believe her senses--so good-natured and tractable had heinvariably been.  It was not for her to see the wellspring ofhuman passion.  A real flame of love is a subtle thing.  It burnsas a will-o'-the-wisp, dancing onward to fairylands of delight.It roars as a furnace.  Too often jealousy is the quality uponwhich it feeds.
　　Chapter XXIV
　　ASHES OF TINDER--A FACE AT THE WINDOW
　　That night Hurstwood remained down town entirely, going to thePalmer House for a bed after his work was through.  He was in afevered state of mind, owing to the blight his wife's actionthreatened to cast upon his entire future.  While he was not surehow much significance might be attached to the threat she hadmade, he was sure that her attitude, if long continued, wouldcause him no end of trouble.  She was determined, and had worstedhim in a very important contest.  How would it be from now on? Hewalked the floor of his little office, and later that of hisroom, putting one thing and another together to no avail.
　　Mrs. Hurstwood, on the contrary, had decided not to lose heradvantage by inaction.  Now that she had practically cowed him,she would follow up her work with demands, the acknowledgment ofwhich would make her word LAW in the future.  He would have topay her the money which she would now regularly demand or therewould be trouble.  It did not matter what he did.  She really didnot care whether he came home any more or not.  The householdwould move along much more pleasantly without him, and she coulddo as she wished without consulting any one.  Now she proposed toconsult a lawyer and hire a detective.  She would find out atonce just what advantages she could gain.
　　Hurstwood walked the floor, mentally arranging the chief pointsof his situation.  "She has that property in her name," he keptsaying to himself.  "What a fool trick that was.  Curse it! Whata fool move that was."
　　He also thought of his managerial position.  "If she raises a rownow I'll lose this thing.  They won't have me around if my namegets in the papers.  My friends, too!" He grew more angry as hethought of the talk any action on her part would create.  Howwould the papers talk about it? Every man he knew would bewondering.  He would have to explain and deny and make a generalmark of himself.  Then Moy would come and confer with him andthere would be the devil to pay.
　　Many little wrinkles gathered between his eyes as he contemplatedthis, and his brow moistened.  He saw no solution of anything--not a loophole left.
　　Through all this thoughts of Carrie flashed upon him, and theapproaching affair of Saturday.  Tangled as all his matters were,he did not worry over that.  It was the one pleasing thing inthis whole rout of trouble.  He could arrange thatsatisfactorily, for Carrie would be glad to wait, if necessary.He would see how things turned out to-morrow, and then he wouldtalk to her.  They were going to meet as usual.  He saw only herpretty face and neat figure and wondered why life was notarranged so that such joy as he found with her could be steadilymaintained.  How much more pleasant it would be.  Then he wouldtake up his wife's threat again, and the wrinkles and moisturewould return.
　　In the morning he came over from the hotel and opened his mail,but there was nothing in it outside the ordinary run.  For somereason he felt as if something might come that way, and wasrelieved when all the envelopes had been scanned and nothingsuspicious noticed.  He began to feel the appetite that had beenwanting before he had reached the office, and decided beforegoing out to the park to meet Carrie to drop in at the GrandPacific and have a pot of coffee and some rolls.  While thedanger had not lessened, it had not as yet materialised, and withhim no news was good news.  If he could only get plenty of timeto think, perhaps something would turn up.  Surely, surely, thisthing would not drift along to catastrophe and he not find a wayout.
　　His spirits fell, however, when, upon reaching the park, hewaited and waited and Carrie did not come.  He held his favouritepost for an hour or more, then arose and began to walk aboutrestlessly.  Could something have happened out there to keep heraway? Could she have been reached by his wife? Surely not.  Solittle did he consider Drouet that it never once occurred to himto worry about his finding out.  He grew restless as heruminated, and then decided that perhaps it was nothing.  She hadnot been able to get away this morning.  That was why no letternotifying him had come.  He would get one to-day.  It wouldprobably be on his desk when he got back.  He would look for itat once.
　　After a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for theMadison car.  To add to his distress, the bright blue sky becameovercast with little fleecy clouds which shut out the sun.  Thewind veered to the east, and by the time he reached his office itwas threatening to drizzle all afternoon.
　　He went in and examined his letters, but there was nothing fromCarrie.  Fortunately, there was nothing from his wife either.  Hethanked his stars that he did not have to confront thatproposition just now when he needed to think so much.  He walkedthe floor again, pretending to be in an ordinary mood, butsecretly troubled beyond the expression of words.
　　At one-thirty he went to Rector's for lunch, and when he returneda messenger was waiting for him.  He looked at the little chapwith a feeling of doubt.
　　"I'm to bring an answer," said the boy.
　　Hurstwood recognised his wife's writing.  He tore it open andread without a show of feeling.  It began in the most formalmanner and was sharply and coldly worded throughout.
　　"I want you to send the money I asked for at once.  I need it tocarry out my plans.  You can stay away if you want to.  Itdoesn't matter in the least.  But I must have some money.  Sodon't delay, but send it by the boy."
　　When he had finished it, he stood holding it in his hands.  Theaudacity of the thing took his breath.  It roused his ire also--the deepest element of revolt in him.  His first impulse was towrite but four words in reply--"Go to the devil!"--but hecompromised by telling the boy that there would be no reply.Then he sat down in his chair and gazed without seeing,contemplating the result of his work.  What would she do aboutthat? The confounded wretch! Was she going to try to bulldoze himinto submission? He would go up there and have it out with her,that's what he would do.  She was carrying things with too high ahand.  These were his first thoughts.
　　Later, however, his old discretion asserted itself.  Somethinghad to be done.  A climax was near and she would not sit idle.He knew her well enough to know that when she had decided upon aplan she would follow it up.  Possibly matters would go into alawyer's hands at once.
　　"Damn her!" he said softly, with his teeth firmly set, "I'll makeit hot for her if she causes me trouble.  I'll make her changeher tone if I have to use force to do it!"
　　He arose from his chair and went and looked out into the street.The long drizzle had begun.  Pedestrians had turned up collars,and trousers at the bottom.  Hands were hidden in the pockets ofthe umbrellaless; umbrellas were up.  The street looked like asea of round black cloth roofs, twisting, bobbing, moving.Trucks and vans were rattling in a noisy line and everywhere menwere shielding themselves as best they could.  He scarcelynoticed the picture.  He was forever confronting his wife,demanding of her to change her attitude toward him before heworked her bodily harm.
　　At four o'clock another note came, which simply said that if themoney was not forthcoming that evening the matter would be laidbefore Fitzgerald and Moy on the morrow, and other steps would betaken to get it.
　　Hurstwood almost exclaimed out loud at the insistency of thisthing.  Yes, he would send her the money.  He'd take it to her--he would go up there and have a talk with her, and that at once.
　　He put on his hat and looked around for his umbrella.  He wouldhave some arrangement of this thing.
　　He called a cab and was driven through the dreary rain to theNorth Side.  On the way his temper cooled as he thought of thedetails of the case.  What did she know? What had she done? Maybeshe'd got hold of Carrie, who knows--or--or Drouet.  Perhaps shereally had evidence, and was prepared to fell him as a man doesanother from secret ambush.  She was shrewd.  Why should shetaunt him this way unless she had good grounds?
　　He began to wish that he had compromised in some way or other--that he had sent the money.  Perhaps he could do it up here.  Hewould go in and see, anyhow.  He would have no row.  By the timehe reached his own street he was keenly alive to the difficultiesof his situation and wished over and over that some solutionwould offer itself, that he could see his way out.  He alightedand went up the steps to the front door, but it was with anervous palpitation of the heart.  He pulled out his key andtried to insert it, but another key was on the inside.  He shookat the knob, but the door was locked.  Then he rang the bell.  Noanswer.  He rang again--this time harder.  Still no answer.  Hejangled it fiercely several times in succession, but withoutavail.  Then he went below.
　　There was a door which opened under the steps into the kitchen,protected by an iron grating, intended as a safeguard againstburglars.  When he reached this he noticed that it also wasbolted and that the kitchen windows were down.  What could itmean? He rang the bell and then waited.  Finally, seeing that noone was coming, he turned and went back to his cab.
　　"I guess they've gone out," he said apologetically to theindividual who was hiding his red face in a loose tarpaulinraincoat.
　　"I saw a young girl up in that winder," returned the cabby.
　　Hurstwood looked, but there was no face there now.  He climbedmoodily into the cab, relieved and distressed.
　　So this was the game, was it? Shut him out and make him pay.Well, by the Lord, that did beat all!
　　Chapter XXV
　　ASHES OF TINDER--THE LOOSING OF STAYS
　　When Hurstwood got back to his office again he was in a greaterquandary than ever.  Lord, Lord, he thought, what had he gotinto? How could things have taken such a violent turn, and soquickly? He could hardly realise how it had all come about.  Itseemed a monstrous, unnatural, unwarranted condition which hadsuddenly descended upon him without his let or hindrance.
　　Meanwhile he gave a thought now and then to Carrie.  What couldbe the trouble in that quarter? No letter had come, no word ofany kind, and yet here it was late in the evening and she hadagreed to meet him that morning.  To-morrow they were to have metand gone off--where? He saw that in the excitement of recentevents he had not formulated a plan upon that score.  He wasdesperately in love, and would have taken great chances to winher under ordinary circumstances, but now--now what? Supposingshe had found out something? Supposing she, too, wrote him andtold him that she knew all--that she would have nothing more todo with him? It would be just like this to happen as things weregoing now.  Meanwhile he had not sent the money.
　　He strolled up and down the polished floor of the resort, hishands in his pockets, his brow wrinkled, his mouth set.  He wasgetting some vague comfort out of a good cigar, but it was nopanacea for the ill which affected him.  Every once in a while hewould clinch his fingers and tap his foot--signs of the stirringmental process he was undergoing.  His whole nature wasvigorously and powerfully shaken up, and he was finding whatlimits the mind has to endurance.  He drank more brandy and sodathan he had any evening in months.  He was altogether a fineexample of great mental perturbation.
　　For all his study nothing came of the evening except this--hesent the money.  It was with great opposition, after two or threehours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial, that atlast he got an envelope, placed in it the requested amount, andslowly sealed it up.
　　Then he called Harry, the boy of all work around the place.
　　"You take this to this address," he said, handing him theenvelope, "and give it to Mrs. Hurstwood."
　　"Yes, sir," said the boy.
　　"If she isn't there bring it back."
　　"Yes, sir"
　　"You've seen my wife?" he asked as a precautionary measure as theboy turned to go.
　　"Oh, yes, sir.  I know her."
　　"All right, now.  Hurry right back."
　　"Any answer?"
　　"I guess not."
　　The boy hastened away and the manager fell to his musings.  Nowhe had done it.  There was no use speculating over that.  He wasbeaten for to-night and he might just as well make the best ofit.  But, oh, the wretchedness of being forced this way! He couldsee her meeting the boy at the door and smiling sardonically.She would take the envelope and know that she had triumphed.  Ifhe only had that letter back he wouldn't send it.  He breathedheavily and wiped the moisture from his face.
　　For relief, he arose and joined in conversation with a fewfriends who were drinking.  He tried to get the interest ofthings about him, but it was not to be.  All the time histhoughts would run out to his home and see the scene beingtherein enacted.  All the time he was wondering what she wouldsay when the boy handed her the envelope.
　　In about an hour and three-quarters the boy returned.  He hadevidently delivered the package, for, as he came up, he made nosign of taking anything out of his pocket.
　　"Well?" said Hurstwood.
　　"I gave it to her."
　　"My wife?"
　　"Yes, sir."
　　"Any answer?"
　　"She said it was high time."
　　Hurstwood scowled fiercely.
　　There was no more to be done upon that score that night.  He wenton brooding over his situation until midnight, when he repairedagain to the Palmer House.  He wondered what the morning wouldbring forth, and slept anything but soundly upon it.Next day he went again to the office and opened his mail,suspicious and hopeful of its contents.  No word from Carrie.Nothing from his wife, which was pleasant.
　　The fact that he had sent the money and that she had received itworked to the ease of his mind, for, as the thought that he haddone it receded, his chagrin at it grew less and his hope ofpeace more.  He fancied, as he sat at his desk, that nothingwould be done for a week or two.  Meanwhile, he would have timeto think.
　　This process of THINKING began by a reversion to Carrie and thearrangement by which he was to get her away from Drouet.  Howabout that now? His pain at her failure to meet or write himrapidly increased as he devoted himself to this subject.  Hedecided to write her care of the West Side Post-office and askfor an explanation, as well as to have her meet him.  The thoughtthat this letter would probably not reach her until Monday chafedhim exceedingly.  He must get some speedier method--but how?
　　He thought upon it for a half-hour, not contemplating a messengeror a cab direct to the house, owing to the exposure of it, butfinding that time was slipping away to no purpose, he wrote theletter and then began to think again.
　　The hours slipped by, and with them the possibility of the unionhe had contemplated.  He had thought to be joyously aiding Carrieby now in the task of joining her interests to his, and here itwas afternoon and nothing done.  Three o'clock came, four, five,six, and no letter.  The helpless manager paced the floor andgrimly endured the gloom of defeat.  He saw a busy Saturdayushered out, the Sabbath in, and nothing done.  All day, the barbeing closed, he brooded alone, shut out from home, from theexcitement of his resort, from Carrie, and without the ability toalter his condition one iota.  It was the worst Sunday he hadspent in his life.
　　In Monday's second mail he encountered a very legal-lookingletter, which held his interest for some time.  It bore theimprint of the law offices of McGregor, James and Hay, and with avery formal "Dear Sir," and "We beg to state," went on to informhim briefly that they had been retained by Mrs. Julia Hurstwoodto adjust certain matters which related to her sustenance andproperty rights, and would he kindly call and see them about thematter at once.
　　He read it through carefully several times, and then merely shookhis head.  It seemed as if his family troubles were justbeginning.
　　"Well!" he said after a time, quite audibly, "I don't know."
　　Then he folded it up and put it in his pocket.
　　To add to his misery there was no word from Carrie.  He was quitecertain now that she knew he was married and was angered at hisperfidy.  His loss seemed all the more bitter now that he neededher most.  He thought he would go out and insist on seeing her ifshe did not send him word of some sort soon.  He was reallyaffected most miserably of all by this desertion.  He had lovedher earnestly enough, but now that the possibility of losing herstared him in the face she seemed much more attractive.  Hereally pined for a word, and looked out upon her with his mind'seye in the most wistful manner.  He did not propose to lose her,whatever she might think.  Come what might, he would adjust thismatter, and soon.  He would go to her and tell her all his familycomplications.  He would explain to her just where he stood andhow much he needed her.  Surely she couldn't go back on him now?It wasn't possible.  He would plead until her anger would melt--until she would forgive him.
　　Suddenly he thought: "Supposing she isn't out there--suppose shehas gone?"
　　He was forced to take his feet.  It was too much to think of andsit still.
　　Nevertheless, his rousing availed him nothing.
　　On Tuesday it was the same way.  He did manage to bring himselfinto the mood to go out to Carrie, but when he got in Ogden Placehe thought he saw a man watching him and went away.  He did notgo within a block of the house.
　　One of the galling incidents of this visit was that he came backon a Randolph Street car, and without noticing arrived almostopposite the building of the concern with which his son wasconnected.  This sent a pang through his heart.  He had called onhis boy there several times.  Now the lad had not sent him aword.  His absence did not seem to be noticed by either of hischildren.  Well, well, fortune plays a man queer tricks.  He gotback to his office and joined in a conversation with friends.  Itwas as if idle chatter deadened the sense of misery.
　　That night he dined at Rector's and returned at once to hisoffice.  In the bustle and show of the latter was his onlyrelief.  He troubled over many little details and talkedperfunctorily to everybody.  He stayed at his desk long after allothers had gone, and only quitted it when the night watchman onhis round pulled at the front door to see if it was safelylocked.
　　On Wednesday he received another polite note from McGregor, Jamesand Hay.  It read:
　　"Dear Sir: We beg to inform you that we are instructed to waituntil to-morrow (Thursday) at one o'clock, before filing suitagainst you, on behalf of Mrs. Julia Hurstwood, for divorce andalimony.  If we do not hear from you before that time we shallconsider that you do not wish to compromise the matter in any wayand act accordingly.  "Very truly yours, etc."
　　"Compromise!" exclaimed Hurstwood bitterly.  "Compromise!"
　　Again he shook his head.
　　So here it was spread out clear before him, and now he knew whatto expect.  If he didn't go and see them they would sue himpromptly.  If he did, he would be offered terms that would makehis blood boil.  He folded the letter and put it with the otherone.  Then he put on his hat and went for a turn about the block.

　　Carrie, left alone by Drouet, listened to his retreating steps,scarcely realising what had happened.  She knew that he hadstormed out.  It was some moments before she questioned whetherhe would return, not now exactly, but ever.  She looked aroundher upon the rooms, out of which the evening light was dying, andwondered why she did not feel quite the same towards them.  Shewent over to the dresser and struck a match, lighting the gas.Then she went back to the rocker to think.
　　It was some time before she could collect her thoughts, but whenshe did, this truth began to take on importance.  She was quitealone.  Suppose Drouet did not come back? Suppose she shouldnever hear anything more of him? This fine arrangement ofchambers would not last long.  She would have to quit them.
　　To her credit, be it said, she never once counted on Hurstwood.She could only approach that subject with a pang of sorrow andregret.  For a truth, she was rather shocked and frightened bythis evidence of human depravity.  He would have tricked herwithout turning an eyelash.  She would have been led into a newerand worse situation.  And yet she could not keep out the picturesof his looks and manners.  Only this one deed seemed strange andmiserable.  It contrasted sharply with all she felt and knewconcerning the man.
　　But she was alone.  That was the greater thought just at present.How about that? Would she go out to work again? Would she beginto look around in the business district? The stage! Oh, yes.Drouet had spoken about that.  Was there any hope there? Shemoved to and fro, in deep and varied thoughts, while the minutesslipped away and night fell completely.  She had had nothing toeat, and yet there she sat, thinking it over.
　　She remembered that she was hungry and went to the littlecupboard in the rear room where were the remains of one of theirbreakfasts.  She looked at these things with certain misgivings.The contemplation of food had more significance than usual.
　　While she was eating she began to wonder how much money she had.It struck her as exceedingly important, and without ado she wentto look for her purse.  It was on the dresser, and in it wereseven dollars in bills and some change.  She quailed as shethought of the insignificance of the amount and rejoiced becausethe rent was paid until the end of the month.  She began also tothink what she would have done if she had gone out into thestreet when she first started.  By the side of that situation, asshe looked at it now, the present seemed agreeable.  She had alittle time at least, and then, perhaps, everything would comeout all right, after all.
　　Drouet had gone, but what of it? He did not seem seriously angry.He only acted as if he were huffy.  He would come back--of coursehe would.  There was his cane in the corner.  Here was one of hiscollars.  He had left his light overcoat in the wardrobe.  Shelooked about and tried to assure herself with the sight of adozen such details, but, alas, the secondary thought arrived.Supposing he did come back.  Then what?
　　Here was another proposition nearly, if not quite, as disturbing.She would have to talk with and explain to him.  He would wanther to admit that he was right.  It would be impossible for herto live with him.
　　On Friday Carrie remembered her appointment with Hurstwood, andthe passing of the hour when she should, by all right of promise,have been in his company served to keep the calamity which hadbefallen her exceedingly fresh and clear.  In her nervousness andstress of mind she felt it necessary to act, and consequently puton a brown street dress, and at eleven o'clock started to visitthe business portion once again.  She must look for work.
　　The rain, which threatened at twelve and began at one, servedequally well to cause her to retrace her steps and remain withindoors as it did to reduce Hurstwood's spirits and give him awretched day.
　　The morrow was Saturday, a half-holiday in many businessquarters, and besides it was a balmy, radiant day, with the treesand grass shining exceedingly green after the rain of the nightbefore.  When she went out the sparrows were twittering merrilyin joyous choruses.  She could not help feeling, as she lookedacross the lovely park, that life was a joyous thing for thosewho did not need to worry, and she wished over and over thatsomething might interfere now to preserve for her the comfortablestate which she had occupied.  She did not want Drouet or hismoney when she thought of it, nor anything more to do withHurstwood, but only the content and ease of mind she hadexperienced, for, after all, she had been happy--happier, atleast, than she was now when confronted by the necessity ofmaking her way alone.
　　When she arrived in the business part it was quite eleveno'clock, and the business had little longer to run.  She did notrealise this at first, being affected by some of the old distresswhich was a result of her earlier adventure into this strenuousand exacting quarter.  She wandered about, assuring herself thatshe was making up her mind to look for something, and at the sametime feeling that perhaps it was not necessary to be in suchhaste about it.  The thing was difficult to encounter, and shehad a few days.  Besides, she was not sure that she was reallyface to face again with the bitter problem of self-sustenance.Anyhow, there was one change for the better.  She knew that shehad improved in appearance.  Her manner had vastly changed.  Herclothes were becoming, and men--well-dressed men, some of thekind who before had gazed at her indifferently from behind theirpolished railings and imposing office partitions--now gazed intoher face with a soft light in their eyes.  In a way, she felt thepower and satisfaction of the thing, but it did not whollyreassure her.  She looked for nothing save what might comelegitimately and without the appearance of special favour.  Shewanted something, but no man should buy her by falseprotestations or favour.  She proposed to earn her livinghonestly.
　　"This store closes at one on Saturdays," was a pleasing andsatisfactory legend to see upon doors which she felt she ought toenter and inquire for work.  It gave her an excuse, and afterencountering quite a number of them, and noting that the clockregistered 12.15, she decided that it would be no use to seekfurther to-day, so she got on a car and went to Lincoln Park.There was always something to see there--the flowers, theanimals, the lake--and she flattered herself that on Monday shewould be up betimes and searching.  Besides, many things mighthappen between now and Monday.
　　Sunday passed with equal doubts, worries, assurances, and heavenknows what vagaries of mind and spirit.  Every half-hour in theday the thought would come to her most sharply, like the tail ofa swishing whip, that action--immediate action--was imperative.At other times she would look about her and assure herself thatthings were not so bad--that certainly she would come out safeand sound.  At such times she would think of Drouet's adviceabout going on the stage, and saw some chance for herself in thatquarter.  She decided to take up that opportunity on the morrow.
　　Accordingly, she arose early Monday morning and dressed herselfcarefully.  She did not know just how such applications weremade, but she took it to be a matter which related more directlyto the theatre buildings.  All you had to do was to inquire ofsome one about the theatre for the manager and ask for aposition.  If there was anything, you might get it, or, at least,he could tell you how.
　　She had had no experience with this class of individualswhatsoever, and did not know the salacity and humour of thetheatrical tribe.  She only knew of the position which Mr. Haleoccupied, but, of all things, she did not wish to encounter thatpersonage, on account of her intimacy with his wife.
　　There was, however, at this time, one theatre, the Chicago OperaHouse, which was considerably in the public eye, and its manager,David A. Henderson, had a fair local reputation.  Carrie had seenone or two elaborate performances there and had heard of severalothers.  She knew nothing of Henderson nor of the methods ofapplying, but she instinctively felt that this would be a likelyplace, and accordingly strolled about in that neighbourhood.  Shecame bravely enough to the showy entrance way, with the polishedand begilded lobby, set with framed pictures out of the currentattraction, leading up to the quiet box-office, but she could getno further.  A noted comic opera comedian was holding forth thatweek, and the air of distinction and prosperity overawed her.She could not imagine that there would be anything in such alofty sphere for her.  She almost trembled at the audacity whichmight have carried her on to a terrible rebuff.  She could findheart only to look at the pictures which were showy and then walkout.  It seemed to her as if she had made a splendid escape andthat it would be foolhardy to think of applying in that quarteragain.
　　This little experience settled her hunting for one day.  Shelooked around elsewhere, but it was from the outside.  She gotthe location of several playhouses fixed in her mind--notably theGrand Opera House and McVickar's, both of which were leading inattractions--and then came away.  Her spirits were materiallyreduced, owing to the newly restored sense of magnitude of thegreat interests and the insignificance of her claims uponsociety, such as she understood them to be.
　　That night she was visited by Mrs. Hale, whose chatter andprotracted stay made it impossible to dwell upon her predicamentor the fortune of the day.  Before retiring, however, she satdown to think, and gave herself up to the most gloomyforebodings.  Drouet had not put in an appearance.  She had hadno word from any quarter, she had spent a dollar of her precioussum in procuring food and paying car fare.  It was evident thatshe would not endure long.  Besides, she had discovered noresource.
　　In this situation her thoughts went out to her sister in VanBuren Street, whom she had not seen since the night of herflight, and to her home at Columbia City, which seemed now a partof something that could not be again.  She looked for no refugein that direction.  Nothing but sorrow was brought her bythoughts of Hurstwood, which would return.  That he could havechosen to dupe her in so ready a manner seemed a cruel thing.
　　Tuesday came, and with it appropriate indecision and speculation.She was in no mood, after her failure of the day before, tohasten forth upon her work-seeking errand, and yet she rebukedherself for what she considered her weakness the day before.Accordingly she started out to revisit the Chicago Opera House,but possessed scarcely enough courage to approach.
　　She did manage to inquire at the box-office, however.
　　"Manager of the company or the house?" asked the smartly dressedindividual who took care of the tickets.  He was favourablyimpressed by Carrie's looks.
　　"I don't know," said Carrie, taken back by the question.
　　"You couldn't see the manager of the house to-day, anyhow,"volunteered the young man.  "He's out of town."
　　He noted her puzzled look, and then added: "What is it you wishto see about?"
　　"I want to see about getting a position," she answered.
　　"You'd better see the manager of the company," he returned, "buthe isn't here now."
　　"When will he be in?" asked Carrie, somewhat relieved by thisinformation.
　　"Well, you might find him in between eleven and twelve.  He'shere after two o'clock."
　　Carrie thanked him and walked briskly out, while the young mangazed after her through one of the side windows of his gildedcoop.
　　"Good-looking," he said to himself, and proceeded to visions ofcondescensions on her part which were exceedingly flattering tohimself.
　　One of the principal comedy companies of the day was playing anengagement at the Grand Opera House.  Here Carrie asked to seethe manager of the company.  She little knew the trivialauthority of this individual, or that had there been a vacancy anactor would have been sent on from New York to fill it.
　　"His office is upstairs," said a man in the box-office.
　　Several persons were in the manager's office, two lounging near awindow, another talking to an individual sitting at a roll-topdesk--the manager.  Carrie glanced nervously about, and began tofear that she should have to make her appeal before the assembledcompany, two of whom--the occupants of the window--were alreadyobserving her carefully.
　　"I can't do it," the manager was saying; "it's a rule of Mr.Frohman's never to allow visitors back of the stage.  No, no!"
　　Carrie timidly waited, standing.  There were chairs, but no onemotioned her to be seated.  The individual to whom the managerhad been talking went away quite crestfallen.  That luminarygazed earnestly at some papers before him, as if they were of thegreatest concern.
　　"Did you see that in the 'Herald' this morning about Nat Goodwin,Harris?"
　　"No," said the person addressed.  "What was it?""Made quite a curtain address at Hooley's last night.  Betterlook it up."
　　Harris reached over to a table and began to look for the"Herald."
　　"What is it?" said the manager to Carrie, apparently noticing herfor the first time.  He thought he was going to be held up forfree tickets.
　　Carrie summoned up all her courage, which was little at best.She realised that she was a novice, and felt as if a rebuff werecertain.  Of this she was so sure that she only wished now topretend she had called for advice.
　　"Can you tell me how to go about getting on the stage?"
　　It was the best way after all to have gone about the matter.  Shewas interesting, in a manner, to the occupant of the chair, andthe simplicity of her request and attitude took his fancy.  Hesmiled, as did the others in the room, who, however, made someslight effort to conceal their humour.
　　"I don't know," he answered, looking her brazenly over.  "Haveyou ever had any experience upon the stage?"
　　"A little," answered Carrie.  "I have taken part in amateurperformances."
　　She thought she had to make some sort of showing in order toretain his interest.
　　"Never studied for the stage?" he said, putting on an airintended as much to impress his friends with his discretion asCarrie.
　　"No, sir."
　　"Well, I don't know," he answered, tipping lazily back in hischair while she stood before him.  "What makes you want to get onthe stage?"
　　She felt abashed at the man's daring, but could only smile inanswer to his engaging smirk, and say:
　　"I need to make a living."
　　"Oh," he answered, rather taken by her trim appearance, andfeeling as if he might scrape up an acquaintance with her."That's a good reason, isn't it? Well, Chicago is not a goodplace for what you want to do.  You ought to be in New York.There's more chance there.  You could hardly expect to getstarted out here." Carrie smiled genially, grateful that heshould condescend to advise her even so much.  He noticed thesmile, and put a slightly different construction on it.  Hethought he saw an easy chance for a little flirtation.
　　"Sit down," he said, pulling a chair forward from the side of hisdesk and dropping his voice so that the two men in the roomshould not hear.  Those two gave each other the suggestion of awink.
　　"Well, I'll be going, Barney," said one, breaking away and soaddressing the manager.  "See you this afternoon."
　　"All right," said the manager.
　　The remaining individual took up a paper as if to read.
　　"Did you have any idea what sort of part you would like to get?"asked the manager softly.
　　"Oh, no," said Carrie.  "I would take anything to begin with."
　　"I see," he said.  "Do you live here in the city?"
　　"Yes, sir."
　　The manager smiled most blandly.
　　"Have you ever tried to get in as a chorus girl?" he asked,assuming a more confidential air.
　　Carrie began to feel that there was something exuberant andunnatural in his manner.
　　"No," she said.
　　"That's the way most girls begin," he went on, "who go on thestage.  It's a good way to get experience."
　　He was turning on her a glance of the companionable andpersuasive manner.
　　"I didn't know that," said Carrie.
　　"It's a difficult thing," he went on, "but there's always achance, you know." Then, as if he suddenly remembered, he pulledout his watch and consulted it.  "I've an appointment at two," hesaid, "and I've got to go to lunch now.  Would you care to comeand dine with me? We can talk it over there."
　　"Oh, no," said Carrie, the whole motive of the man flashing onher at once.  "I have an engagement myself."
　　"That's too bad," he said, realising that he had been a littlebeforehand in his offer and that Carrie was about to go away."Come in later.  I may know of something."
　　"Thank you," she answered, with some trepidation and went out.
　　"She was good-looking, wasn't she?" said the manager's companion,who had not caught all the details of the game he had played.
　　"Yes, in a way," said the other, sore to think the game had beenlost.  "She'd never make an actress, though.  Just another chorusgirl--that's all."
　　This little experience nearly destroyed her ambition to call uponthe manager at the Chicago Opera House, but she decided to do soafter a time.  He was of a more sedate turn of mind.  He said atonce that there was no opening of any sort, and seemed toconsider her search foolish.
　　"Chicago is no place to get a start," he said.  "You ought to bein New York."
　　Still she persisted, and went to McVickar's, where she could notfind any one.  "The Old Homestead" was running there, but theperson to whom she was referred was not to be found.
　　These little expeditions took up her time until quite fouro'clock, when she was weary enough to go home.  She felt as ifshe ought to continue and inquire elsewhere, but the results sofar were too dispiriting.  She took the car and arrived at OgdenPlace in three-quarters of an hour, but decided to ride on to theWest Side branch of the Post-office, where she was accustomed toreceive Hurstwood's letters.  There was one there now, writtenSaturday, which she tore open and read with mingled feelings.There was so much warmth in it and such tense complaint at herhaving failed to meet him, and her subsequent silence, that sherather pitied the man.  That he loved her was evident enough.That he had wished and dared to do so, married as he was, was theevil.  She felt as if the thing deserved an answer, andconsequently decided that she would write and let him know thatshe knew of his married state and was justly incensed at hisdeception.  She would tell him that it was all over between them.
　　At her room, the wording of this missive occupied her for sometime, for she fell to the task at once.  It was most difficult.
　　"You do not need to have me explain why I did not meet you," shewrote in part.  "How could you deceive me so? You cannot expectme to have anything more to do with you.  I wouldn't under anycircumstances.  Oh, how could you act so?" she added in a burstof feeling.  "You have caused me more misery than you can think.I hope you will get over your infatuation for me.  We must notmeet any more.  Good-bye."
　　She took the letter the next morning, and at the corner droppedit reluctantly into the letter-box, still uncertain as to whethershe should do so or not.  Then she took the car and went downtown.
　　This was the dull season with the department stores, but she waslistened to with more consideration than was usually accorded toyoung women applicants, owing to her neat and attractiveappearance.  She was asked the same old questions with which shewas already familiar.
　　"What can you do? Have you ever worked in a retail store before?Are you experienced?"
　　At The Fair, See and Company's, and all the great stores it wasmuch the same.  It was the dull season, she might come in alittle later, possibly they would like to have her.
　　When she arrived at the house at the end of the day, weary anddisheartened, she discovered that Drouet had been there.  Hisumbrella and light overcoat were gone.  She thought she missedother things, but could not be sure.  Everything had not beentaken.
　　So his going was crystallising into staying.  What was she to donow? Evidently she would be facing the world in the same old waywithin a day or two.  Her clothes would get poor.  She put hertwo hands together in her customary expressive way and pressedher fingers.  Large tears gathered in her eyes and broke hotacross her cheeks.  She was alone, very much alone.
　　Drouet really had called, but it was with a very different mindfrom that which Carrie had imagined.  He expected to find her, tojustify his return by claiming that he came to get the remainingportion of his wardrobe, and before he got away again to patch upa peace.
　　Accordingly, when he arrived, he was disappointed to find Carrieout.  He trifled about, hoping that she was somewhere in theneighbourhood and would soon return.  He constantly listened,expecting to hear her foot on the stair.
　　When he did so, it was his intention to make believe that he hadjust come in and was disturbed at being caught.  Then he wouldexplain his need of his clothes and find out how things stood.
　　Wait as he did, however, Carrie did not come.  From potteringaround among the drawers, in momentary expectation of her arrivalhe changed to looking out of the window, and from that to restinghimself in the rocking-chair.  Still no Carrie.  He began to growrestless and lit a cigar.  After that he walked the floor.  Thenhe looked out of the window and saw clouds gathering.  Heremembered an appointment at three.  He began to think that itwould be useless to wait, and got hold of his umbrella and lightcoat, intending to take these things, any way.  It would scareher, he hoped.  To-morrow he would come back for the others.  Hewould find out how things stood.
　　As he started to go he felt truly sorry that he had missed her.There was a little picture of her on the wall, showing herarrayed in the little jacket he had first bought her--her face alittle more wistful than he had seen it lately.  He was reallytouched by it, and looked into the eyes of it with a rather rarefeeling for him.
　　"You didn't do me right, Cad," he said, as if he were addressingher in the flesh.
　　Then he went to the door, took a good look around and went out.
　　Chapter XXVII
　　WHEN WATERS ENGULF US WE REACH FOR A STAR
　　It was when he returned from his disturbed stroll about thestreets, after receiving the decisive note from McGregor, Jamesand Hay, that Hurstwood found the letter Carrie had written himthat morning.  He thrilled intensely as he noted the handwriting,and rapidly tore it open.
　　"Then," he thought, "she loves me or she would not have writtento me at all."
　　He was slightly depressed at the tenor of the note for the firstfew minutes, but soon recovered.  "She wouldn't write at all ifshe didn't care for me."
　　This was his one resource against the depression which held him.He could extract little from the wording of the letter, but thespirit he thought he knew.
　　There was really something exceedingly human--if not pathetic--inhis being thus relieved by a clearly worded reproof.  He who hadfor so long remained satisfied with himself now looked outside ofhimself for comfort--and to such a source.  The mystic cords ofaffection! How they bind us all.
　　The colour came to his cheeks.  For the moment he forgot theletter from McGregor, James and Hay.  If he could only haveCarrie, perhaps he could get out of the whole entanglement--perhaps it would not matter.  He wouldn't care what his wife didwith herself if only he might not lose Carrie.  He stood up andwalked about, dreaming his delightful dream of a life continuedwith this lovely possessor of his heart.
　　It was not long, however, before the old worry was back forconsideration, and with it what weariness! He thought of themorrow and the suit.  He had done nothing, and here was theafternoon slipping away.  It was now a quarter of four.  At fivethe attorneys would have gone home.  He still had the morrowuntil noon.  Even as he thought, the last fifteen minutes passedaway and it was five.  Then he abandoned the thought of seeingthem any more that day and turned to Carrie.
　　It is to be observed that the man did not justify himself tohimself.  He was not troubling about that.  His whole thought wasthe possibility of persuading Carrie.  Nothing was wrong in that.He loved her dearly.  Their mutual happiness depended upon it.Would that Drouet were only away!
　　While he was thinking thus elatedly, he remembered that he wantedsome clean linen in the morning.
　　This he purchased, together with a half-dozen ties, and went tothe Palmer House.  As he entered he thought he saw Drouetascending the stairs with a key.  Surely not Drouet! Then hethought, perhaps they had changed their abode temporarily.  Hewent straight up to the desk.
　　"Is Mr. Drouet stopping here?" he asked of the clerk.
　　"I think he is," said the latter, consulting his private registrylist.  "Yes."
　　"Is that so?" exclaimed Hurstwood, otherwise concealing hisastonishment.  "Alone?" he added.
　　"Yes," said the clerk.
　　Hurstwood turned away and set his lips so as best to express andconceal his feelings.
　　"How's that?" he thought.  "They've had a row."
　　He hastened to his room with rising spirits and changed hislinen.  As he did so, he made up his mind that if Carrie wasalone, or if she had gone to another place, it behooved him tofind out.  He decided to call at once.
　　"I know what I'll do," he thought.  "I'll go to the door and askif Mr. Drouet is at home.  That will bring out whether he isthere or not and where Carrie is."
　　He was almost moved to some muscular display as he thought of it.He decided to go immediately after supper.
　　On coming down from his room at six, he looked carefully about tosee if Drouet was present and then went out to lunch.  He couldscarcely eat, however, he was so anxious to be about his errand.Before starting he thought it well to discover where Drouet wouldbe, and returned to his hotel.
　　"Has Mr. Drouet gone out?" he asked of the clerk.
　　"No," answered the latter, "he's in his room.  Do you wish tosend up a card?""No, I'll call around later," answered Hurstwood, and strolledout.
　　He took a Madison car and went direct to Ogden Place this timewalking boldly up to the door.  The chambermaid answered hisknock.
　　"Is Mr. Drouet in?" said Hurstwood blandly.
　　"He is out of the city," said the girl, who had heard Carrie tellthis to Mrs. Hale.
　　"Is Mrs. Drouet in?"
　　"No, she has gone to the theatre."
　　"Is that so?" said Hurstwood, considerably taken back; then, asif burdened with something important, "You don't know to whichtheatre?"
　　The girl really had no idea where she had gone, but not likingHurstwood, and wishing to cause him trouble, answered: "Yes,Hooley's."
　　"Thank you," returned the manager, and, tipping his hat slightly,went away.
　　"I'll look in at Hooley's," thought he, but as a matter of facthe did not.  Before he had reached the central portion of thecity he thought the whole matter over and decided it would beuseless.  As much as he longed to see Carrie, he knew she wouldbe with some one and did not wish to intrude with his plea there.A little later he might do so--in the morning.  Only in themorning he had the lawyer question before him.
　　This little pilgrimage threw quite a wet blanket upon his risingspirits.  He was soon down again to his old worry, and reachedthe resort anxious to find relief.  Quite a company of gentlemenwere making the place lively with their conversation.  A group ofCook County politicians were conferring about a round cherry-woodtable in the rear portion of the room.  Several young merrymakerswere chattering at the bar before making a belated visit to thetheatre.  A shabbily-genteel individual, with a red nose and anold high hat, was sipping a quiet glass of ale alone at one endof the bar.  Hurstwood nodded to the politicians and went intohis office.
　　About ten o'clock a friend of his, Mr. Frank L.  Taintor, a localsport and racing man, dropped in, and seeing Hurstwood alone inhis office came to the door.
　　"Hello, George!" he exclaimed.
　　"How are you, Frank?" said Hurstwood, somewhat relieved by thesight of him.  "Sit down," and he motioned him to one of thechairs in the little room.
　　"What's the matter, George?" asked Taintor.  "You look a littleglum.  Haven't lost at the track, have you?"
　　"I'm not feeling very well to-night.  I had a slight cold theother day."
　　"Take whiskey, George," said Taintor.  "You ought to know that."
　　Hurstwood smiled.
　　While they were still conferring there, several other ofHurstwood's friends entered, and not long after eleven, thetheatres being out, some actors began to drop in--among them somenotabilities.
　　Then began one of those pointless social conversations so commonin American resorts where the would-be gilded attempt to rub offgilt from those who have it in abundance.  If Hurstwood had oneleaning, it was toward notabilities.  He considered that, ifanywhere, he belonged among them.  He was too proud to toady, tookeen not to strictly observe the plane he occupied when therewere those present who did not appreciate him, but, in situationslike the present, where he could shine as a gentleman and bereceived without equivocation as a friend and equal among men ofknown ability, he was most delighted.  It was on such occasions,if ever, that he would "take something."  When the social flavourwas strong enough he would even unbend to the extent of drinkingglass for glass with his associates, punctiliously observing histurn to pay as if he were an outsider like the others.  If heever approached intoxication--or rather that ruddy warmth andcomfortableness which precedes the more sloven state--it was whenindividuals such as these were gathered about him, when he wasone of a circle of chatting celebrities.  To-night, disturbed aswas his state, he was rather relieved to find company, and nowthat notabilities were gathered, he laid aside his troubles forthe nonce, and joined in right heartily.
　　It was not long before the imbibing began to tell.  Stories beganto crop up--those ever-enduring, droll stories which form themajor portion of the conversation among American men under suchcircumstances.
　　Twelve o'clock arrived, the hour for closing, and with it thecompany took leave.  Hurstwood shook hands with them mostcordially.  He was very roseate physically.  He had arrived atthat state where his mind, though clear, was, nevertheless, warmin its fancies.  He felt as if his troubles were not veryserious.  Going into his office, he began to turn over certainaccounts, awaiting the departure of the bartenders and thecashier, who soon left.
　　It was the manager's duty, as well as his custom, after all weregone to see that everything was safely closed up for the night.As a rule, no money except the cash taken in after banking hourswas kept about the place, and that was locked in the safe by thecashier, who, with the owners, was joint keeper of the secretcombination, but, nevertheless, Hurstwood nightly took theprecaution to try the cash drawers and the safe in order to seethat they were tightly closed.  Then he would lock his own littleoffice and set the proper light burning near the safe, afterwhich he would take his departure.
　　Never in his experience had he found anything out of order, butto-night, after shutting down his desk, he came out and tried thesafe.  His way was to give a sharp pull.  This time the doorresponded.  He was slightly surprised at that, and looking infound the money cases as left for the day, apparentlyunprotected.  His first thought was, of course, to inspect thedrawers and shut the door.
　　"I'll speak to Mayhew about this to-morrow," he thought.
　　The latter had certainly imagined upon going out a half-hourbefore that he had turned the knob on the door so as to springthe lock.  He had never failed to do so before.  But to-nightMayhew had other thoughts.  He had been revolving the problem ofa business of his own.
　　"I'll look in here," thought the manager, pulling out the moneydrawers.  He did not know why he wished to look in there.  It wasquite a superfluous action, which another time might not havehappened at all.
　　As he did so, a layer of bills, in parcels of a thousand, such asbanks issue, caught his eye.  He could not tell how much theyrepresented, but paused to view them.  Then he pulled out thesecond of the cash drawers.  In that were the receipts of theday.
　　"I didn't know Fitzgerald and Moy ever left any money this way,"his mind said to itself.  "They must have forgotten it."
　　He looked at the other drawer and paused again.
　　"Count them," said a voice in his ear.
　　He put his hand into the first of the boxes and lifted the stack,letting the separate parcels fall.  They were bills of fifty andone hundred dollars done in packages of a thousand.  He thoughthe counted ten such.
　　"Why don't I shut the safe?" his mind said to itself, lingering."What makes me pause here?"
　　For answer there came the strangest words:
　　"Did you ever have ten thousand dollars in ready money?"
　　Lo, the manager remembered that he had never had so much.  Allhis property had been slowly accumulated, and now his wife ownedthat.  He was worth more than forty thousand, all told--but shewould get that.
　　He puzzled as he thought of these things, then pushed in thedrawers and closed the door, pausing with his hand upon the knob,which might so easily lock it all beyond temptation.  Still hepaused.  Finally he went to the windows and pulled down thecurtains.  Then he tried the door, which he had previouslylocked.  What was this thing, making him suspicious? Why did hewish to move about so quietly.  He came back to the end of thecounter as if to rest his arm and think.  Then he went andunlocked his little office door and turned on the light.  He alsoopened his desk, sitting down before it, only to think strangethoughts.
　　"The safe is open," said a voice.  "There is just the leastlittle crack in it.  The lock has not been sprung."
　　The manager floundered among a jumble of thoughts.  Now all theentanglement of the day came back.  Also the thought that herewas a solution.  That money would do it.  If he had that andCarrie.  He rose up and stood stock-still, looking at the floor.
　　"What about it?" his mind asked, and for answer he put his handslowly up and scratched his head.
　　The manager was no fool to be led blindly away by such an errantproposition as this, but his situation was peculiar.  Wine was inhis veins.  It had crept up into his head and given him a warmview of the situation.  It also coloured the possibilities of tenthousand for him.  He could see great opportunities with that.He could get Carrie.  Oh, yes, he could! He could get rid of hiswife.  That letter, too, was waiting discussion to-morrowmorning.  He would not need to answer that.  He went back to thesafe and put his hand on the knob.  Then he pulled the door openand took the drawer with the money quite out.
　　With it once out and before him, it seemed a foolish thing tothink about leaving it.  Certainly it would.  Why, he could livequietly with Carrie for years.
　　Lord! what was that? For the first time he was tense, as if astern hand had been laid upon his shoulder.  He looked fearfullyaround.  Not a soul was present.  Not a sound.  Some one wasshuffling by on the sidewalk.  He took the box and the money andput it back in the safe.  Then he partly closed the door again.
　　To those who have never wavered in conscience, the predicament ofthe individual whose mind is less strongly constituted and whotrembles in the balance between duty and desire is scarcelyappreciable, unless graphically portrayed.  Those who have neverheard that solemn voice of the ghostly clock which ticks withawful distinctness, "thou shalt," "thou shalt not," "thou shalt,""thou shalt not," are in no position to judge.  Not alone insensitive, highly organised natures is such a mental conflictpossible.  The dullest specimen of humanity, when drawn by desiretoward evil, is recalled by a sense of right, which isproportionate in power and strength to his evil tendency.  Wemust remember that it may not be a knowledge of right, for noknowledge of right is predicated of the animal's instinctiverecoil at evil.  Men are still led by instinct before they areregulated by knowledge.  It is instinct which recalls thecriminal--it is instinct (where highly organised reasoning isabsent) which gives the criminal his feeling of danger, his fearof wrong.
　　At every first adventure, then, into some untried evil, the mindwavers.  The clock of thought ticks out its wish and its denial.To those who have never experienced such a mental dilemma, thefollowing will appeal on the simple ground of revelation.
　　When Hurstwood put the money back, his nature again resumed itsease and daring.  No one had observed him.  He was quite alone.No one could tell what he wished to do.  He could work this thingout for himself.
　　The imbibation of the evening had not yet worn off.  Moist as washis brow, tremble as did his hand once after the nameless fright,he was still flushed with the fumes of liquor.  He scarcelynoticed that the time was passing.  He went over his situationonce again, his eye always seeing the money in a lump, his mindalways seeing what it would do.  He strolled into his littleroom, then to the door, then to the safe again.  He put his handon the knob and opened it.  There was the money! Surely no harmcould come from looking at it!
　　He took out the drawer again and lifted the bills.  They were sosmooth, so compact, so portable.  How little they made, afterall.  He decided he would take them.  Yes, he would.  He wouldput them in his pocket.  Then he looked at that and saw theywould not go there.  His hand satchel! To be sure, his handsatchel.  They would go in that--all of it would.  No one wouldthink anything of it either.  He went into the little office andtook it from the shelf in the corner.  Now he set it upon hisdesk and went out toward the safe.  For some reason he did notwant to fill it out in the big room.First he brought the bills and then the loose receipts of theday.  He would take it all.  He put the empty drawers back andpushed the iron door almost to, then stood beside it meditating.
　　The wavering of a mind under such circumstances is an almostinexplicable thing, and yet it is absolutely true.  Hurstwoodcould not bring himself to act definitely.  He wanted to thinkabout it--to ponder over it, to decide whether it were best.  Hewas drawn by such a keen desire for Carrie, driven by such astate of turmoil in his own affairs that he thought constantly itwould be best, and yet he wavered.  He did not know what evilmight result from it to him--how soon he might come to grief.The true ethics of the situation never once occurred to him, andnever would have, under any circumstances.
　　After he had all the money in the handbag, a revulsion of feelingseized him.  He would not do it--no! Think of what a scandal itwould make.  The police! They would be after him.  He would haveto fly, and where? Oh, the terror of being a fugitive fromjustice! He took out the two boxes and put all the money back.In his excitement he forgot what he was doing, and put the sumsin the wrong boxes.  As he pushed the door to, he thought heremembered doing it wrong and opened the door again.  There werethe two boxes mixed.
　　He took them out and straightened the matter, but now the terrorhad gone.  Why be afraid?
　　While the money was in his hand the lock clicked.  It had sprung!Did he do it? He grabbed at the knob and pulled vigorously.  Ithad closed.  Heavens! he was in for it now, sure enough.
　　The moment he realised that the safe was locked for a surety, thesweat burst out upon his brow and he trembled violently.  Helooked about him and decided instantly.  There was no delayingnow.
　　"Supposing I do lay it on the top," he said, "and go away,they'll know who took it.  I'm the last to close up.  Besides,other things will happen."
　　At once he became the man of action.
　　"I must get out of this," he thought.
　　He hurried into his little room, took down his light overcoat andhat, locked his desk, and grabbed the satchel.  Then he turnedout all but one light and opened the door.  He tried to put onhis old assured air, but it was almost gone.  He was repentingrapidly.
　　"I wish I hadn't done that," he said.  "That was a mistake."
　　He walked steadily down the street, greeting a night watchmanwhom he knew who was trying doors.  He must get out of the city,and that quickly.
　　"I wonder how the trains run?" he thought.
　　Instantly he pulled out his watch and looked.  It was nearlyhalf-past one.
　　At the first drugstore he stopped, seeing a long-distancetelephone booth inside.  It was a famous drugstore, and containedone of the first private telephone booths ever erected."I want to use your 'phone a minute," he said to the night clerk.
　　The latter nodded.
　　"Give me 1643," he called to Central, after looking up theMichigan Central depot number.  Soon he got the ticket agent.
　　"How do the trains leave here for Detroit?" he asked.
　　The man explained the hours.
　　"No more to-night?"
　　"Nothing with a sleeper.  Yes, there is, too," he added.  "Thereis a mail train out of here at three o'clock."
　　"All right," said Hurstwood.  "What time does that get toDetroit?"
　　He was thinking if he could only get there and cross the riverinto Canada, he could take his time about getting to Montreal.He was relieved to learn that it would reach there by noon.
　　"Mayhew won't open the safe till nine," he thought.  "They can'tget on my track before noon."
　　Then he thought of Carrie.  With what speed must he get her, ifhe got her at all.  She would have to come along.  He jumped intothe nearest cab standing by.
　　"To Ogden Place," he said sharply.  "I'll give you a dollar moreif you make good time."
　　The cabby beat his horse into a sort of imitation gallop whichwas fairly fast, however.  On the way Hurstwood thought what todo.  Reaching the number, he hurried up the steps and did notspare the bell in waking the servant.
　　"Is Mrs. Drouet in?" he asked.
　　"Yes," said the astonished girl.
　　"Tell her to dress and come to the door at once.  Her husband isin the hospital, injured, and wants to see her."
　　The servant girl hurried upstairs, convinced by the man'sstrained and emphatic manner.
　　"What!" said Carrie, lighting the gas and searching for herclothes.
　　"Mr. Drouet is hurt and in the hospital.  He wants to see you.The cab's downstairs."
　　Carrie dressed very rapidly, and soon appeared below, forgettingeverything save the necessities.
　　"Drouet is hurt," said Hurstwood quickly.  "He wants to see you.Come quickly."
　　Carrie was so bewildered that she swallowed the whole story.
　　"Get in," said Hurstwood, helping her and jumping after.
　　The cabby began to turn the horse around."Michigan Central depot," he said, standing up and speaking solow that Carrie could not hear, "as fast as you can go."
　　Chapter XXVIII
　　A PILGRIM, AN OUTLAW--THE SPIRIT DETAINED
　　The cab had not travelled a short block before Carrie, settlingherself and thoroughly waking in the night atmosphere, asked:
　　"What's the matter with him? Is he hurt badly?"
　　"It isn't anything very serious," Hurstwood said solemnly.  Hewas very much disturbed over his own situation, and now that hehad Carrie with him, he only wanted to get safely out of reach ofthe law.  Therefore he was in no mood for anything save suchwords as would further his plans distinctly.
　　Carrie did not forget that there was something to be settledbetween her and Hurstwood, but the thought was ignored in heragitation.  The one thing was to finish this strange pilgrimage.
　　"Where is he?"
　　"Way out on the South Side," said Hurstwood.  "We'll have to takethe train.  It's the quickest way."
　　Carrie said nothing, and the horse gambolled on.  The weirdnessof the city by night held her attention.  She looked at the longreceding rows of lamps and studied the dark, silent houses.
　　"How did he hurt himself?" she asked--meaning what was the natureof his injuries.  Hurstwood understood.  He hated to lie any morethan necessary, and yet he wanted no protests until he was out ofdanger.
　　"I don't know exactly," he said.  "They just called me up to goand get you and bring you out.  They said there wasn't any needfor alarm, but that I shouldn't fail to bring you."
　　The man's serious manner convinced Carrie, and she became silent,wondering.
　　Hurstwood examined his watch and urged the man to hurry.  For onein so delicate a position he was exceedingly cool.  He could onlythink of how needful it was to make the train and get quietlyaway.  Carrie seemed quite tractable, and he congratulatedhimself.
　　In due time they reached the depot, and after helping her out hehanded the man a five-dollar bill and hurried on.
　　"You wait here," he said to Carrie, when they reached thewaiting-room, "while I get the tickets."
　　"Have I much time to catch that train for Detroit?" he asked ofthe agent.
　　"Four minutes," said the latter.
　　He paid for two tickets as circumspectly as possible.
　　"Is it far?" said Carrie, as he hurried back.
　　"Not very," he said.  "We must get right in."
　　He pushed her before him at the gate, stood between her and theticket man while the latter punched their tickets, so that shecould not see, and then hurried after.
　　There was a long line of express and passenger cars and one ortwo common day coaches.  As the train had only recently been madeup and few passengers were expected, there were only one or twobrakemen waiting.  They entered the rear day coach and sat down.Almost immediately, "All aboard," resounded faintly from theoutside, and the train started.
　　Carrie began to think it was a little bit curious--this going toa depot--but said nothing.  The whole incident was so out of thenatural that she did not attach too much weight to anything sheimagined.
　　"How have you been?" asked Hurstwood gently, for he now breathedeasier.
　　"Very well," said Carrie, who was so disturbed that she could notbring a proper attitude to bear in the matter.  She was stillnervous to reach Drouet and see what could be the matter.Hurstwood contemplated her and felt this.  He was not disturbedthat it should be so.  He did not trouble because she was movedsympathetically in the matter.  It was one of the qualities inher which pleased him exceedingly.  He was only thinking how heshould explain.  Even this was not the most serious thing in hismind, however.  His own deed and present flight were the greatshadows which weighed upon him.
　　"What a fool I was to do that," he said over and over.  "What amistake!"
　　In his sober senses, he could scarcely realise that the thing hadbeen done.  He could not begin to feel that he was a fugitivefrom justice.  He had often read of such things, and had thoughtthey must be terrible, but now that the thing was upon him, heonly sat and looked into the past.  The future was a thing whichconcerned the Canadian line.  He wanted to reach that.  As forthe rest he surveyed his actions for the evening, and countedthem parts of a great mistake.
　　"Still," he said, "what could I have done?"
　　Then he would decide to make the best of it, and would begin todo so by starting the whole inquiry over again.  It was afruitless, harassing round, and left him in a queer mood to dealwith the proposition he had in the presence of Carrie.
　　The train clacked through the yards along the lake front, and ranrather slowly to Twenty-fourth Street.  Brakes and signals werevisible without.  The engine gave short calls with its whistle,and frequently the bell rang.  Several brakemen came through,bearing lanterns.  They were locking the vestibules and puttingthe cars in order for a long run.
　　Presently it began to gain speed, and Carrie saw the silentstreets flashing by in rapid succession.  The engine also beganits whistle-calls of four parts, with which it signalled dangerto important crossings.
　　"Is it very far?" asked Carrie."Not so very," said Hurstwood.  He could hardly repress a smileat her simplicity.  He wanted to explain and conciliate her, buthe also wanted to be well out of Chicago.
　　In the lapse of another half-hour it became apparent to Carriethat it was quite a run to wherever he was taking her, anyhow.
　　"Is it in Chicago?" she asked nervously.  They were now farbeyond the city limits, and the train was scudding across theIndiana line at a great rate.
　　"No," he said, "not where we are going."
　　There was something in the way he said this which aroused her inan instant.
　　Her pretty brow began to contract.
　　"We are going to see Charlie, aren't we?" she asked.
　　He felt that the time was up.  An explanation might as well comenow as later.  Therefore, he shook his head in the most gentlenegative.
　　"What?" said Carrie.  She was nonplussed at the possibility ofthe errand being different from what she had thought.
　　He only looked at her in the most kindly and mollifying way.
　　"Well, where are you taking me, then?" she asked, her voiceshowing the quality of fright.
　　"I'll tell you, Carrie, if you'll be quiet.  I want you to comealong with me to another city,"
　　"Oh," said Carrie, her voice rising into a weak cry.  "Let meoff.  I don't want to go with you."
　　She was quite appalled at the man's audacity.  This was somethingwhich had never for a moment entered her head.  Her one thoughtnow was to get off and away.  If only the flying train could bestopped, the terrible trick would be amended.
　　She arose and tried to push out into the aisle--anywhere.  Sheknew she had to do something.  Hurstwood laid a gentle hand onher.
　　"Sit still, Carrie," he said.  "Sit still.  It won't do you anygood to get up here.  Listen to me and I'll tell you what I'lldo.  Wait a moment."
　　She was pushing at his knees, but he only pulled her back.  Noone saw this little altercation, for very few persons were in thecar, and they were attempting to doze.
　　"I won't," said Carrie, who was, nevertheless, complying againsther will.  "Let me go," she said.  "How dare you?" and largetears began to gather in her eyes.
　　Hurstwood was now fully aroused to the immediate difficulty, andceased to think of his own situation.  He must do something withthis girl, or she would cause him trouble.  He tried the art ofpersuasion with all his powers aroused.
　　"Look here now, Carrie," he said, "you mustn't act this way.  Ididn't mean to hurt your feelings.  I don't want to do anythingto make you feel bad."
　　"Oh," sobbed Carrie, "oh, oh--oo--o!"
　　"There, there," he said, "you mustn't cry.  Won't you listen tome? Listen to me a minute, and I'll tell you why I came to dothis thing.  I couldn't help it.  I assure you I couldn't.  Won'tyou listen?"
　　Her sobs disturbed him so that he was quite sure she did not heara word he said.
　　"Won't you listen?" he asked.
　　"No, I won't," said Carrie, flashing up.  "I want you to take meout of this, or I'll tell the conductor.  I won't go with you.It's a shame," and again sobs of fright cut off her desire forexpression.
　　Hurstwood listened with some astonishment.  He felt that she hadjust cause for feeling as she did, and yet he wished that hecould straighten this thing out quickly.  Shortly the conductorwould come through for the tickets.  He wanted no noise, notrouble of any kind.  Before everything he must make her quiet.
　　"You couldn't get out until the train stops again," saidHurstwood.  "It won't be very long until we reach anotherstation.  You can get out then if you want to.  I won't stop you.All I want you to do is to listen a moment.  You'll let me tellyou, won't you?"
　　Carrie seemed not to listen.  She only turned her head toward thewindow, where outside all was black.  The train was speeding withsteady grace across the fields and through patches of wood.  Thelong whistles came with sad, musical effect as the lonelywoodland crossings were approached.
　　Now the conductor entered the car and took up the one or twofares that had been added at Chicago.  He approached Hurstwood,who handed out the tickets.  Poised as she was to act, Carriemade no move.  She did not look about.
　　When the conductor had gone again Hurstwood felt relieved.
　　"You're angry at me because I deceived you," he said.  "I didn'tmean to, Carrie.  As I live I didn't.  I couldn't help it.  Icouldn't stay away from you after the first time I saw you."
　　He was ignoring the last deception as something that might go bythe board.  He wanted to convince her that his wife could nolonger be a factor in their relationship.  The money he hadstolen he tried to shut out of his mind.
　　"Don't talk to me," said Carrie, "I hate you.  I want you to goaway from me.  I am going to get out at the very next station."
　　She was in a tremble of excitement and opposition as she spoke.
　　"All right," he said, "but you'll hear me out, won't you? Afterall you have said about loving me, you might hear me.  I don'twant to do you any harm.  I'll give you the money to go back withwhen you go.  I merely want to tell you, Carrie.  You can't stopme from loving you, whatever you may think."
　　He looked at her tenderly, but received no reply."You think I have deceived you badly, but I haven't.  I didn't doit willingly.  I'm through with my wife.  She hasn't any claimson me.  I'll never see her any more.  That's why I'm here to-night.  That's why I came and got you."
　　"You said Charlie was hurt," said Carrie, savagely.  "Youdeceived me.  You've been deceiving me all the time, and now youwant to force me to run away with you."
　　She was so excited that she got up and tried to get by him again.He let her, and she took another seat.  Then he followed.
　　"Don't run away from me, Carrie," he said gently.  "Let meexplain.  If you will only hear me out you will see where Istand.  I tell you my wife is nothing to me.  She hasn't beenanything for years or I wouldn't have ever come near you.  I'mgoing to get a divorce just as soon as I can.  I'll never see heragain.  I'm done with all that.  You're the only person I want.If I can have you I won't ever think of another woman again."
　　Carrie heard all this in a very ruffled state.  It soundedsincere enough, however, despite all he had done.  There was atenseness in Hurstwood's voice and manner which could but havesome effect.  She did not want anything to do with him.  He wasmarried, he had deceived her once, and now again, and she thoughthim terrible.  Still there is something in such daring and powerwhich is fascinating to a woman, especially if she can be made tofeel that it is all prompted by love of her.
　　The progress of the train was having a great deal to do with thesolution of this difficult situation.  The speeding wheels anddisappearing country put Chicago farther and farther behind.Carrie could feel that she was being borne a long distance off--that the engine was making an almost through run to some distantcity.  She felt at times as if she could cry out and make such arow that some one would come to her aid; at other times it seemedan almost useless thing--so far was she from any aid, no matterwhat she did.  All the while Hurstwood was endeavouring toformulate his plea in such a way that it would strike home andbring her into sympathy with him.
　　"I was simply put where I didn't know what else to do."
　　Carrie deigned no suggestion of hearing this.
　　"When I say you wouldn't come unless I could marry you, I decidedto put everything else behind me and get you to come away withme.  I'm going off now to another city.  I want to go to Montrealfor a while, and then anywhere you want to.  We'll go and live inNew York, if you say."
　　"I'll not have anything to do with you," said Carrie.  "I want toget off this train.  Where are we going?"
　　"To Detroit," said Hurstwood.
　　"Oh!" said Carrie, in a burst of anguish.  So distant anddefinite a point seemed to increase the difficulty.
　　"Won't you come along with me?" he said, as if there was greatdanger that she would not.  "You won't need to do anything buttravel with me.  I'll not trouble you in any way.  You can seeMontreal and New York, and then if you don't want to stay you cango back.  It will be better than trying to go back to-night."
　　The first gleam of fairness shone in this proposition for Carrie.It seemed a plausible thing to do, much as she feared hisopposition if she tried to carry it out.  Montreal and New York!Even now she was speeding toward those great, strange lands, andcould see them if she liked.  She thought, but made no sign.
　　Hurstwood thought he saw a shade of compliance in this.  Heredoubled his ardour.
　　"Think," he said, "what I've given up.  I can't go back toChicago any more.  I've got to stay away and live alone now, ifyou don't come with me.  You won't go back on me entirely, willyou, Carrie?"
　　"I don't want you to talk to me," she answered forcibly.
　　Hurstwood kept silent for a while.
　　Carrie felt the train to be slowing down.  It was the moment toact if she was to act at all.  She stirred uneasily.
　　"Don't think of going, Carrie," he said.  "If you ever cared forme at all, come along and let's start right.  I'll do whateveryou say.  I'll marry you, or I'll let you go back.  Give yourselftime to think it over.  I wouldn't have wanted you to come if Ihadn't loved you.  I tell you, Carrie, before God, I can't livewithout you.  I won't!"
　　There was the tensity of fierceness in the man's plea whichappealed deeply to her sympathies.  It was a dissolving firewhich was actuating him now.  He was loving her too intensely tothink of giving her up in this, his hour of distress.  Heclutched her hand nervously and pressed it with all the force ofan appeal.
　　The train was now all but stopped.  It was running by some carson a side track.  Everything outside was dark and dreary.  A fewsprinkles on the window began to indicate that it was raining.Carrie hung in a quandary, balancing between decision andhelplessness.  Now the train stopped, and she was listening tohis plea.  The engine backed a few feet and all was still.
　　She wavered, totally unable to make a move.  Minute after minuteslipped by and still she hesitated, he pleading.
　　"Will you let me come back if I want to?" she asked, as if shenow had the upper hand and her companion was utterly subdued.
　　"Of course," he answered, "you know I will."
　　Carrie only listened as one who has granted a temporary amnesty.She began to feel as if the matter were in her hands entirely.
　　The train was again in rapid motion.  Hurstwood changed thesubject.
　　"Aren't you very tired?" he said.
　　"No," she answered.
　　"Won't you let me get you a berth in the sleeper?"
　　She shook her head, though for all her distress and his trickeryshe was beginning to notice what she had always felt--histhoughtfulness.
　　"Oh, yes," he said, "you will feel so much better."
　　She shook her head.
　　"Let me fix my coat for you, anyway," and he arose and arrangedhis light coat in a comfortable position to receive her head.
　　"There," he said tenderly, "now see if you can't rest a little."He could have kissed her for her compliance.  He took his seatbeside her and thought a moment.
　　"I believe we're in for a heavy rain," he said.
　　"So it looks," said Carrie, whose nerves were quieting under thesound of the rain drops, driven by a gusty wind, as the trainswept on frantically through the shadow to a newer world.
　　The fact that he had in a measure mollified Carrie was a sourceof satisfaction to Hurstwood, but it furnished only the mosttemporary relief.  Now that her opposition was out of the way, hehad all of his time to devote to the consideration of his ownerror.
　　His condition was bitter in the extreme, for he did not want themiserable sum he had stolen.  He did not want to be a thief.That sum or any other could never compensate for the state whichhe had thus foolishly doffed.  It could not give him back hishost of friends, his name, his house and family, nor Carrie, ashe had meant to have her.  He was shut out from Chicago--from hiseasy, comfortable state.  He had robbed himself of his dignity,his merry meetings, his pleasant evenings.  And for what? Themore he thought of it the more unbearable it became.  He began tothink that he would try and restore himself to his old state.  Hewould return the miserable thievings of the night and explain.Perhaps Moy would understand.  Perhaps they would forgive him andlet him come back.
　　By noontime the train rolled into Detroit and he began to feelexceedingly nervous.  The police must be on his track by now.They had probably notified all the police of the big cities, anddetectives would be watching for him.  He remembered instances inwhich defaulters had been captured.  Consequently, he breathedheavily and paled somewhat.  His hands felt as if they must havesomething to do.  He simulated interest in several scenes withoutwhich he did not feel.  He repeatedly beat his foot upon thefloor.
　　Carrie noticed his agitation, but said nothing.  She had no ideawhat it meant or that it was important.
　　He wondered now why he had not asked whether this train went onthrough to Montreal or some Canadian point.  Perhaps he couldhave saved time.  He jumped up and sought the conductor.
　　"Does any part of this train go to Montreal?" he asked.
　　"Yes, the next sleeper back does."
　　He would have asked more, but it did not seem wise, so he decidedto inquire at the depot.
　　The train rolled into the yards, clanging and puffing.
　　"I think we had better go right on through to Montreal," he saidto Carrie.  "I'll see what the connections are when we get off."
　　He was exceedingly nervous, but did his best to put on a calmexterior.  Carrie only looked at him with large, troubled eyes.She was drifting mentally, unable to say to herself what to do.
　　The train stopped and Hurstwood led the way out.  He lookedwarily around him, pretending to look after Carrie.  Seeingnothing that indicated studied observation, he made his way tothe ticket office.
　　"The next train for Montreal leaves when?" he asked.
　　"In twenty minutes," said the man.
　　He bought two tickets and Pullman berths.  Then he hastened backto Carrie.
　　"We go right out again," he said, scarcely noticing that Carrielooked tired and weary.
　　"I wish I was out of all this," she exclaimed gloomily.
　　"You'll feel better when we reach Montreal," he said.
　　"I haven't an earthly thing with me," said Carrie; "not even ahandkerchief."
　　"You can buy all you want as soon as you get there, dearest," heexplained.  "You can call in a dressmaker."
　　Now the crier called the train ready and they got on.  Hurstwoodbreathed a sigh of relief as it started.  There was a short runto the river, and there they were ferried over.  They had barelypulled the train off the ferry-boat when he settled back with asigh.
　　"It won't be so very long now," he said, remembering her in hisrelief.  "We get there the first thing in the morning."
　　Carrie scarcely deigned to reply.
　　"I'll see if there is a dining-car," he added.  "I'm hungry."
　　Chapter XXIX
　　THE SOLACE OF TRAVEL--THE BOATS OF THE SEA
　　To the untravelled, territory other than their own familiar heathis invariably fascinating.  Next to love, it is the one thingwhich solaces and delights.  Things new are too important to beneglected, and mind, which is a mere reflection of sensoryimpressions, succumbs to the flood of objects.  Thus lovers areforgotten, sorrows laid aside, death hidden from view.  There isa world of accumulated feeling back of the trite dramaticexpression--"I am going away."
　　As Carrie looked out upon the flying scenery she almost forgotthat she had been tricked into this long journey against her willand that she was without the necessary apparel for travelling.She quite forgot Hurstwood's presence at times, and looked awayto homely farmhouses and cosey cottages in villages withwondering eyes.  It was an interesting world to her.  Her lifehad just begun.  She did not feel herself defeated at all.Neither was she blasted in hope.  The great city held much.Possibly she would come out of bondage into freedom--who knows?Perhaps she would be happy.  These thoughts raised her above thelevel of erring.  She was saved in that she was hopeful.
　　The following morning the train pulled safely into Montreal andthey stepped down, Hurstwood glad to be out of danger, Carriewondering at the novel atmosphere of the northern city.  Longbefore, Hurstwood had been here, and now he remembered the nameof the hotel at which he had stopped.  As they came out of themain entrance of the depot he heard it called anew by a busman.
　　"We'll go right up and get rooms," he said.
　　At the clerk's office Hurstwood swung the register about whilethe clerk came forward.  He was thinking what name he would putdown.  With the latter before him he found no time forhesitation.  A name he had seen out of the car window cameswiftly to him.  It was pleasing enough.  With an easy hand hewrote, "G. W. Murdock and wife." It was the largest concession tonecessity he felt like making.  His initials he could not spare.
　　When they were shown their room Carrie saw at once that he hadsecured her a lovely chamber.
　　"You have a bath there," said he.  "Now you can clean up when youget ready."
　　Carrie went over and looked out the window, while Hurstwoodlooked at himself in the glass.  He felt dusty and unclean.  Hehad no trunk, no change of linen, not even a hair-brush.
　　"I'll ring for soap and towels," he said, "and send you up ahair-brush.  Then you can bathe and get ready for breakfast.I'll go for a shave and come back and get you, and then we'll goout and look for some clothes for you."
　　He smiled good-naturedly as he said this.
　　"All right," said Carrie.
　　She sat down in one of the rocking-chairs, while Hurstwood waitedfor the boy, who soon knocked.
　　"Soap, towels, and a pitcher of ice-water."
　　"Yes, sir."
　　"I'll go now," he said to Carrie, coming toward her and holdingout his hands, but she did not move to take them.
　　"You're not mad at me, are you?" he asked softly.
　　"Oh, no!" she answered, rather indifferently.
　　"Don't you care for me at all?"
　　She made no answer, but looked steadily toward the window.
　　"Don't you think you could love me a little?" he pleaded, takingone of her hands, which she endeavoured to draw away.  "You oncesaid you did."
　　"What made you deceive me so?" asked Carrie.
　　"I couldn't help it," he said, "I wanted you too much."
　　"You didn't have any right to want me," she answered, strikingcleanly home.
　　"Oh, well, Carrie," he answered, "here I am.  It's too late now.Won't you try and care for me a little?"
　　He looked rather worsted in thought as he stood before her.
　　She shook her head negatively.
　　"Let me start all over again.  Be my wife from to-day on."
　　Carrie rose up as if to step away, he holding her hand.  Now heslipped his arm about her and she struggled, but in vain.  Heheld her quite close.  Instantly there flamed up in his body theall compelling desire.  His affection took an ardent form.
　　"Let me go," said Carrie, who was folded close to him.
　　"Won't you love me?" he said.  "Won't you be mine from now on?"
　　Carrie had never been ill-disposed toward him.  Only a momentbefore she had been listening with some complacency, rememberingher old affection for him.  He was so handsome, so daring!
　　Now, however, this feeling had changed to one of opposition,which rose feebly.  It mastered her for a moment, and then, heldclose as she was, began to wane.  Something else in her spoke.This man, to whose bosom she was being pressed, was strong; hewas passionate, he loved her, and she was alone.  If she did notturn to him--accept of his love--where else might she go? Herresistance half dissolved in the flood of his strong feeling.
　　She found him lifting her head and looking into her eyes.  Whatmagnetism there was she could never know.  His many sins,however, were for the moment all forgotten.
　　He pressed her closer and kissed her, and she felt that furtheropposition was useless.
　　"Will you marry me?" she asked, forgetting how.
　　"This very day," he said, with all delight.
　　Now the hall-boy pounded on the door and he released his holdupon her regretfully.
　　"You get ready now, will you," he said, "at once?"
　　"Yes," she answered.
　　"I'll be back in three-quarters of an hour."
　　Carrie, flushed and excited, moved away as he admitted the boy.
　　Below stairs, he halted in the lobby to look for a barber shop.For the moment, he was in fine feather.  His recent victory overCarrie seemed to atone for much he had endured during the lastfew days.  Life seemed worth fighting for.  This eastward flightfrom all things customary and attached seemed as if it might havehappiness in store.  The storm showed a rainbow at the end ofwhich might be a pot of gold.
　　He was about to cross to a little red-and-white striped bar whichwas fastened up beside a door when a voice greeted himfamiliarly.  Instantly his heart sank."Why, hello, George, old man!" said the voice.  "What are youdoing down here?"
　　Hurstwood was already confronted, and recognised his friendKenny, the stock-broker.
　　"Just attending to a little private matter," he answered, hismind working like a key-board of a telephone station.  This manevidently did not know--he had not read the papers.
　　"Well, it seems strange to see you way up here," said Mr. Kennygenially.  "Stopping here?"
　　"Yes," said Hurstwood uneasily, thinking of his handwriting onthe register.
　　"Going to be in town long?"
　　"No, only a day or so."
　　"Is that so? Had your breakfast?"
　　"Yes," said Hurstwood, lying blandly.  "I'm just going for ashave."
　　"Won't you come have a drink?"
　　"Not until afterwards," said the ex-manager.  "I'll see youlater.  Are you stopping here?"
　　"Yes," said Mr. Kenny, and then, turning the word again added:"How are things out in Chicago?"
　　"About the same as usual," said Hurstwood, smiling genially.
　　"Wife with you?"
　　"No."
　　"Well, I must see more of you to-day.  I'm just going in here forbreakfast.  Come in when you're through."
　　"I will," said Hurstwood, moving away.  The whole conversationwas a trial to him.  It seemed to add complications with veryword.  This man called up a thousand memories.  He representedeverything he had left.  Chicago, his wife, the elegant resort--all these were in his greeting and inquiries.  And here he was inthis same hotel expecting to confer with him, unquestionablywaiting to have a good time with him.  All at once the Chicagopapers would arrive.  The local papers would have accounts inthem this very day.  He forgot his triumph with Carrie in thepossibility of soon being known for what he was, in this man'seyes, a safe-breaker.  He could have groaned as he went into thebarber shop.  He decided to escape and seek a more secludedhotel.
　　Accordingly, when he came out he was glad to see the lobby clear,and hastened toward the stairs.  He would get Carrie and go outby the ladies' entrance.  They would have breakfast in some moreinconspicuous place.
　　Across the lobby, however, another individual was surveying him.He was of a commonplace Irish type, small of stature, cheaplydressed, and with a head that seemed a smaller edition of somehuge ward politician's.  This individual had been evidentlytalking with the clerk, but now he surveyed the ex-managerkeenly.
　　Hurstwood felt the long-range examination and recognised thetype.  Instinctively he felt that the man was a detective--thathe was being watched.  He hurried across, pretending not tonotice, but in his mind was a world of thoughts.  What wouldhappen now? What could these people do? He began to troubleconcerning the extradition laws.  He did not understand themabsolutely.  Perhaps he could be arrested.  Oh, if Carrie shouldfind out! Montreal was too warm for him.  He began to long to beout of it.
　　Carrie had bathed and was waiting when he arrived.  She lookedrefreshed--more delightful than ever, but reserved.  Since he hadgone she had resumed somewhat of her cold attitude towards him.Love was not blazing in her heart.  He felt it, and his troublesseemed increased.  He could not take her in his arms; he did noteven try.  Something about her forbade it.  In part his opinionwas the result of his own experiences and reflections belowstairs.
　　"You're ready, are you?" he said kindly.
　　"Yes," she answered.
　　"We'll go out for breakfast.  This place down here doesn't appealto me very much."
　　"All right," said Carrie.
　　They went out, and at the corner the commonplace Irish individualwas standing, eyeing him.  Hurstwood could scarcely refrain fromshowing that he knew of this chap's presence.  The insolence inthe fellow's eye was galling.  Still they passed, and heexplained to Carrie concerning the city.  Another restaurant wasnot long in showing itself, and here they entered.
　　"What a queer town this is," said Carrie, who marvelled at itsolely because it was not like Chicago.
　　"It Isn't as lively as Chicago," said Hurstwood.  "Don't you likeit?"
　　"No," said Carrie, whose feelings were already localised in thegreat Western city.
　　"Well, it isn't as interesting," said Hurstwood.
　　"What's here?" asked Carrie, wondering at his choosing to visitthis town.
　　"Nothing much," returned Hurstwood.  "It's quite a resort.There's some pretty scenery about here."
　　Carrie listened, but with a feeling of unrest.  There was muchabout her situation which destroyed the possibility ofappreciation.
　　"We won't stay here long," said Hurstwood, who was now reallyglad to note her dissatisfaction.  "You pick out your clothes assoon as breakfast is over and we'll run down to New York soon.You'll like that.  It's a lot more like a city than any placeoutside Chicago."
　　He was really planning to slip out and away.  He would see whatthese detectives would do--what move his employers at Chicagowould make--then he would slip away--down to New York, where itwas easy to hide.  He knew enough about that city to know thatits mysteries and possibilities of mystification were infinite.
　　The more he thought, however, the more wretched his situationbecame.  He saw that getting here did not exactly clear up theground.  The firm would probably employ detectives to watch him--Pinkerton men or agents of Mooney and Boland.  They might arresthim the moment he tried to leave Canada.  So he might becompelled to remain here months, and in what a state!
　　Back at the hotel Hurstwood was anxious and yet fearful to seethe morning papers.  He wanted to know how far the news of hiscriminal deed had spread.  So he told Carrie he would be up in afew moments, and went to secure and scan the dailies.  Nofamiliar or suspicious faces were about, and yet he did not likereading in the lobby, so he sought the main parlour on the floorabove and, seated by a window there, looked them over.  Verylittle was given to his crime, but it was there, several "sticks"in all, among all the riffraff of telegraphed murders, accidents,marriages, and other news.  He wished, half sadly, that he couldundo it all.  Every moment of his time in this far-off abode ofsafety but added to his feeling that he had made a great mistake.There could have been an easier way out if he had only known.
　　He left the papers before going to the room, thinking thus tokeep them out of the hands of Carrie.
　　"Well, how are you feeling?" he asked of her.  She was engaged inlooking out of the window.
　　"Oh, all right," she answered.
　　He came over, and was about to begin a conversation with her,when a knock came at their door.
　　"Maybe it's one of my parcels," said Carrie.
　　Hurstwood opened the door, outside of which stood the individualwhom he had so thoroughly suspected.
　　"You're Mr. Hurstwood, are you?" said the latter, with a volumeof affected shrewdness and assurance.
　　"Yes," said Hurstwood calmly.  He knew the type so thoroughlythat some of his old familiar indifference to it returned.  Suchmen as these were of the lowest stratum welcomed at the resort.He stepped out and closed the door.
　　"Well, you know what I am here for, don't you?" said the manconfidentially.
　　"I can guess," said Hurstwood softly.
　　"Well, do you intend to try and keep the money?"
　　"That's my affair," said Hurstwood grimly.
　　"You can't do it, you know," said the detective, eyeing himcoolly.
　　"Look here, my man," said Hurstwood authoritatively, "you don'tunderstand anything about this case, and I can't explain to you.Whatever I intend to do I'll do without advice from the outside.You'll have to excuse me.""Well, now, there's no use of your talking that way," said theman, "when you're in the hands of the police.  We can make a lotof trouble for you if we want to.  You're not registered right inthis house, you haven't got your wife with you, and thenewspapers don't know you're here yet.  You might as well bereasonable."
　　"What do you want to know?" asked Hurstwood.
　　"Whether you're going to send back that money or not."
　　Hurstwood paused and studied the floor.
　　"There's no use explaining to you about this," he said at last."There's no use of your asking me.  I'm no fool, you know.  Iknow just what you can do and what you can't.  You can create alot of trouble if you want to.  I know that all right, but itwon't help you to get the money.  Now, I've made up my mind whatto do.  I've already written Fitzgerald and Moy, so there'snothing I can say.  You wait until you hear more from them."
　　All the time he had been talking he had been moving away from thedoor, down the corridor, out of the hearing of Carrie.  They werenow near the end where the corridor opened into the large generalparlour.
　　"You won't give it up?" said the man.
　　The words irritated Hurstwood greatly.  Hot blood poured into hisbrain.  Many thoughts formulated themselves.  He was no thief.He didn't want the money.  If he could only explain to Fitzgeraldand Moy, maybe it would be all right again.
　　"See here," he said, "there's no use my talking about this atall.  I respect your power all right, but I'll have to deal withthe people who know."
　　"Well, you can't get out of Canada with it," said the man.
　　"I don't want to get out," said Hurstwood.  "When I get readythere'll be nothing to stop me for."
　　He turned back, and the detective watched him closely.  It seemedan intolerable thing.  Still he went on and into the room.
　　"Who was it?" asked Carrie.
　　"A friend of mine from Chicago."
　　The whole of this conversation was such a shock that, coming asit did after all the other worry of the past week, it sufficed toinduce a deep gloom and moral revulsion in Hurstwood.  What hurthim most was the fact that he was being pursued as a thief.  Hebegan to see the nature of that social injustice which sees butone side--often but a single point in a long tragedy.  All thenewspapers noted but one thing, his taking the money.  How andwherefore were but indifferently dealt with.  All thecomplications which led up to it were unknown.  He was accusedwithout being understood.
　　Sitting in his room with Carrie the same day, he decided to sendthe money back.  He would write Fitzgerald and Moy, explain all,and then send it by express.  Maybe they would forgive him.Perhaps they would ask him back.  He would make good the falsestatement he had made about writing them.  Then he would leavethis peculiar town.
　　For an hour he thought over this plausible statement of thetangle.  He wanted to tell them about his wife, but couldn't.  Hefinally narrowed it down to an assertion that he was light-headedfrom entertaining friends, had found the safe open, and havinggone so far as to take the money out, had accidentally closed it.This act he regretted very much.  He was sorry he had put them toso much trouble.  He would undo what he could by sending themoney back--the major portion of it.  The remainder he would payup as soon as he could.  Was there any possibility of his beingrestored? This he only hinted at.
　　The troubled state of the man's mind may be judged by the veryconstruction of this letter.  For the nonce he forgot what apainful thing it would be to resume his old place, even if itwere given him.  He forgot that he had severed himself from thepast as by a sword, and that if he did manage to in some wayreunite himself with it, the jagged line of separation andreunion would always show.  He was always forgetting something--his wife, Carrie, his need of money, present situation, orsomething--and so did not reason clearly.  Nevertheless, he sentthe letter, waiting a reply before sending the money.
　　Meanwhile, he accepted his present situation with Carrie, gettingwhat joy out of it he could.
　　Out came the sun by noon, and poured a golden flood through theiropen windows.  Sparrows were twittering.  There were laughter andsong in the air.  Hurstwood could not keep his eyes from Carrie.She seemed the one ray of sunshine in all his trouble.  Oh, ifshe would only love him wholly--only throw her arms around him inthe blissful spirit in which he had seen her in the little parkin Chicago--how happy he would be! It would repay him; it wouldshow him that he had not lost all.  He would not care.
　　"Carrie," he said, getting up once and coming over to her, "areyou going to stay with me from now on?"
　　She looked at him quizzically, but melted with sympathy as thevalue of the look upon his face forced itself upon her.  It waslove now, keen and strong--love enhanced by difficulty and worry.She could not help smiling.
　　"Let me be everything to you from now on," he said.  "Don't makeme worry any more.  I'll be true to you.  We'll go to New Yorkand get a nice flat.  I'll go into business again, and we'll behappy.  Won't you be mine?"
　　Carrie listened quite solemnly.  There was no great passion inher, but the drift of things and this man's proximity created asemblance of affection.  She felt rather sorry for him--a sorrowborn of what had only recently been a great admiration.  Truelove she had never felt for him.  She would have known as much ifshe could have analysed her feelings, but this thing which shenow felt aroused by his great feeling broke down the barriersbetween them.
　　"You'll stay with me, won't you?" he asked.
　　"Yes," she said, nodding her head.
　　He gathered her to himself, imprinting kisses upon her lips andcheeks.
　　"You must marry me, though," she said."I'll get a license to-day," he answered.
　　"How?" she asked.
　　"Under a new name," he answered.  "I'll take a new name and livea new life.  From now on I'm Murdock."
　　"Oh, don't take that name," said Carrie.
　　"Why not?" he said.
　　"I don't like it."
　　"Well, what shall I take?" he asked.
　　"Oh, anything, only don't take that."
　　He thought a while, still keeping his arms about her, and thensaid:
　　"How would Wheeler do?"
　　"That's all right," said Carrie.
　　"Well, then, Wheeler," he said.  "I'll get the license thisafternoon."
　　They were married by a Baptist minister, the first divine theyfound convenient.
　　At last the Chicago firm answered.  It was by Mr. Moy'sdictation.  He was astonished that Hurstwood had done this; verysorry that it had come about as it had.  If the money werereturned, they would not trouble to prosecute him, as they reallybore him no ill-will.  As for his returning, or their restoringhim to his former position, they had not quite decided what theeffect of it would be.  They would think it over and correspondwith him later, possibly, after a little time, and so on.
　　The sum and substance of it was that there was no hope, and theywanted the money with the least trouble possible.  Hurstwood readhis doom.  He decided to pay $9,500 to the agent whom they saidthey would send, keeping $1,300 for his own use.  He telegraphedhis acquiescence, explained to the representative who called atthe hotel the same day, took a certificate of payment, and toldCarrie to pack her trunk.  He was slightly depressed over thisnewest move at the time he began to make it, but eventuallyrestored himself.  He feared that even yet he might be seized andtaken back, so he tried to conceal his movements, but it wasscarcely possible.  He ordered Carrie's trunk sent to the depot,where he had it sent by express to New York.  No one seemed to beobserving him, but he left at night.  He was greatly agitatedlest at the first station across the border or at the depot inNew York there should be waiting for him an officer of the law.
　　Carrie, ignorant of his theft and his fears, enjoyed the entryinto the latter city in the morning.  The round green hillssentinelling the broad, expansive bosom of the Hudson held herattention by their beauty as the train followed the line of thestream.  She had heard of the Hudson River, the great city of NewYork, and now she looked out, filling her mind with the wonder ofit.
　　As the train turned east at Spuyten Duyvil and followed the eastbank of the Harlem River, Hurstwood nervously called herattention to the fact that they were on the edge of the city.After her experience with Chicago, she expected long lines ofcars--a great highway of tracks--and noted the difference.  Thesight of a few boats in the Harlem and more in the East Rivertickled her young heart.  It was the first sign of the great sea.Next came a plain street with five-story brick flats, and thenthe train plunged into the tunnel.
　　"Grand Central Station!" called the trainman, as, after a fewminutes of darkness and smoke, daylight reappeared.  Hurstwoodarose and gathered up his small grip.  He was screwed up to thehighest tension.  With Carrie he waited at the door and thendismounted.  No one approached him, but he glanced furtively toand fro as he made for the street entrance.  So excited was hethat he forgot all about Carrie, who fell behind, wondering athis self-absorption.  As he passed through the depot proper thestrain reached its climax and began to wane.  All at once he wason the sidewalk, and none but cabmen hailed him.  He heaved agreat breath and turned, remembering Carrie.
　　"I thought you were going to run off and leave me," she said.
　　"I was trying to remember which car takes us to the Gilsey," heanswered.
　　Carrie hardly heard him, so interested was she in the busy scene.
　　"How large is New York?" she asked.
　　"Oh a million or more," said Hurstwood.
　　He looked around and hailed a cab, but he did so in a changedway.
　　For the first time in years the thought that he must count theselittle expenses flashed through his mind.  It was a disagreeablething.
　　He decided he would lose no time living in hotels but would renta flat.  Accordingly he told Carrie, and she agreed.
　　"We'll look to-day, if you want to," she said.
　　Suddenly he thought of his experience in Montreal.  At the moreimportant hotels he would be certain to meet Chicagoans whom heknew.  He stood up and spoke to the driver.
　　"Take me to the Belford," he said, knowing it to be lessfrequented by those whom he knew.  Then he sat down.
　　"Where is the residence part?" asked Carrie, who did not take thetall five-story walls on either hand to be the abodes offamilies.
　　"Everywhere," said Hurstwood, who knew the city fairly well."There are no lawns in New York.  All these are houses."
　　"Well, then, I don't like it," said Carrie, who was coming tohave a few opinions of her own.
　　Chapter XXX
　　THE KINGDOM OF GREATNESS--THE PILGRIM A DREAM
　　Whatever a man like Hurstwood could be in Chicago, it is veryevident that he would be but an inconspicuous drop in an oceanlike New York.  In Chicago, whose population still ranged about500,000, millionaires were not numerous.  The rich had not becomeso conspicuously rich as to drown all moderate incomes inobscurity.  The attention of the inhabitants was not sodistracted by local celebrities in the dramatic, artistic,social, and religious fields as to shut the well-positioned manfrom view.  In Chicago the two roads to distinction were politicsand trade.  In New York the roads were any one of a half-hundred,and each had been diligently pursued by hundreds, so thatcelebrities were numerous.  The sea was already full of whales.A common fish must needs disappear wholly from view--remainunseen.  In other words, Hurstwood was nothing.
　　There is a more subtle result of such a situation as this, which,though not always taken into account, produces the tragedies ofthe world.  The great create an atmosphere which reacts badlyupon the small.  This atmosphere is easily and quickly felt.Walk among the magnificent residences, the splendid equipages,the gilded shops, restaurants, resorts of all kinds; scent theflowers, the silks, the wines; drink of the laughter springingfrom the soul of luxurious content, of the glances which gleamlike light from defiant spears; feel the quality of the smileswhich cut like glistening swords and of strides born of place,and you shall know of what is the atmosphere of the high andmighty.  Little use to argue that of such is not the kingdom ofgreatness, but so long as the world is attracted by this and thehuman heart views this as the one desirable realm which it mustattain, so long, to that heart, will this remain the realm ofgreatness.  So long, also, will the atmosphere of this realm workits desperate results in the soul of man.  It is like a chemicalreagent.  One day of it, like one drop of the other, will soaffect and discolour the views, the aims, the desire of the mind,that it will thereafter remain forever dyed.  A day of it to theuntried mind is like opium to the untried body.  A craving is setup which, if gratified, shall eternally result in dreams anddeath.  Aye! dreams unfulfilled--gnawing, luring, idle phantomswhich beckon and lead, beckon and lead, until death anddissolution dissolve their power and restore us blind to nature'sheart.
　　A man of Hurstwood's age and temperament is not subject to theillusions and burning desires of youth, but neither has he thestrength of hope which gushes as a fountain in the heart ofyouth.  Such an atmosphere could not incite in him the cravingsof a boy of eighteen, but in so far as they were excited, thelack of hope made them proportionately bitter.  He could not failto notice the signs of affluence and luxury on every hand.  Hehad been to New York before and knew the resources of its folly.In part it was an awesome place to him, for here gathered allthat he most respected on this earth--wealth, place, and fame.The majority of the celebrities with whom he had tipped glassesin his day as manager hailed from this self-centred and populousspot.  The most inviting stories of pleasure and luxury had beentold of places and individuals here.  He knew it to be true thatunconsciously he was brushing elbows with fortune the livelongday; that a hundred or five hundred thousand gave no one theprivilege of living more than comfortably in so wealthy a place.Fashion and pomp required more ample sums, so that the poor manwas nowhere.  All this he realised, now quite sharply, as hefaced the city, cut off from his friends, despoiled of his modestfortune, and even his name, and forced to begin the battle forplace and comfort all over again.  He was not old, but he was notso dull but that he could feel he soon would be.  Of a sudden,then, this show of fine clothes, place, and power took onpeculiar significance.  It was emphasised by contrast with hisown distressing state.
　　And it was distressing.  He soon found that freedom from fear ofarrest was not the sine qua non of his existence.  That dangerdissolved, the next necessity became the grievous thing.  Thepaltry sum of thirteen hundred and some odd dollars set againstthe need of rent, clothing, food, and pleasure for years to comewas a spectacle little calculated to induce peace of mind in onewho had been accustomed to spend five times that sum in thecourse of a year.  He thought upon the subject rather activelythe first few days he was in New York, and decided that he mustact quickly.  As a consequence, he consulted the businessopportunities advertised in the morning papers and beganinvestigations on his own account.
　　That was not before he had become settled, however.  Carrie andhe went looking for a flat, as arranged, and found one inSeventy-eighth Street near Amsterdam Avenue.  It was a five-storybuilding, and their flat was on the third floor.  Owing to thefact that the street was not yet built up solidly, it waspossible to see east to the green tops of the trees in CentralPark and west to the broad waters of the Hudson, a glimpse ofwhich was to be had out of the west windows.  For the privilegeof six rooms and a bath, running in a straight line, they werecompelled to pay thirty-five dollars a month--an average, and yetexorbitant, rent for a home at the time.  Carrie noticed thedifference between the size of the rooms here and in Chicago andmentioned it.
　　"You'll not find anything better, dear," said Hurstwood, "unlessyou go into one of the old-fashioned houses, and then you won'thave any of these conveniences."
　　Carrie picked out the new abode because of its newness and brightwood-work.  It was one of the very new ones supplied with steamheat, which was a great advantage.  The stationary range, hot andcold water, dumb-waiter, speaking tubes, and call-bell for thejanitor pleased her very much.  She had enough of the instinctsof a housewife to take great satisfaction in these things.
　　Hurstwood made arrangements with one of the instalment houseswhereby they furnished the flat complete and accepted fiftydollars down and ten dollars a month.  He then had a littleplate, bearing the name G. W. Wheeler, made, which he placed onhis letter-box in the hall.  It sounded exceedingly odd to Carrieto be called Mrs. Wheeler by the janitor, but in time she becameused to it and looked upon the name as her own.
　　These house details settled, Hurstwood visited some of theadvertised opportunities to purchase an interest in someflourishing down-town bar.  After the palatial resort in AdamsStreet, he could not stomach the commonplace saloons which hefound advertised.  He lost a number of days looking up these andfinding them disagreeable.  He did, however, gain considerableknowledge by talking, for he discovered the influence of TammanyHall and the value of standing in with the police.  The mostprofitable and flourishing places he found to be those whichconducted anything but a legitimate business, such as thatcontrolled by Fitzgerald and Moy.  Elegant back rooms and privatedrinking booths on the second floor were usually adjuncts of veryprofitable places.  He saw by portly keepers, whose shirt frontsshone with large diamonds, and whose clothes were properly cut,that the liquor business here, as elsewhere, yielded the samegolden profit.At last he found an individual who had a resort in Warren Street,which seemed an excellent venture.  It was fairly well-appearingand susceptible of improvement.  The owner claimed the businessto be excellent, and it certainly looked so.
　　"We deal with a very good class of people," he told Hurstwood."Merchants, salesmen, and professionals.  It's a well-dressedclass.  No bums.  We don't allow 'em in the place."
　　Hurstwood listened to the cash-register ring, and watched thetrade for a while.
　　"It's profitable enough for two, is it?" he asked.
　　"You can see for yourself if you're any judge of the liquortrade," said the owner.  "This is only one of the two places Ihave.  The other is down in Nassau Street.  I can't tend to themboth alone.  If I had some one who knew the business thoroughly Iwouldn't mind sharing with him in this one and letting him manageit."
　　"I've had experience enough," said Hurstwood blandly, but he felta little diffident about referring to Fitzgerald and Moy.
　　"Well, you can suit yourself, Mr. Wheeler," said the proprietor.
　　He only offered a third interest in the stock, fixtures, andgood-will, and this in return for a thousand dollars andmanagerial ability on the part of the one who should come in.There was no property involved, because the owner of the saloonmerely rented from an estate.
　　The offer was genuine enough, but it was a question withHurstwood whether a third interest in that locality could be madeto yield one hundred and fifty dollars a month, which he figuredhe must have in order to meet the ordinary family expenses and becomfortable.  It was not the time, however, after many failuresto find what he wanted, to hesitate.  It looked as though a thirdwould pay a hundred a month now.  By judicious management andimprovement, it might be made to pay more.  Accordingly he agreedto enter into partnership, and made over his thousand dollars,preparing to enter the next day.
　　His first inclination was to be elated, and he confided to Carriethat he thought he had made an excellent arrangement.  Time,however, introduced food for reflection.  He found his partner tobe very disagreeable.  Frequently he was the worse for liquor,which made him surly.  This was the last thing which Hurstwoodwas used to in business.  Besides, the business varied.  It wasnothing like the class of patronage which he had enjoyed inChicago.  He found that it would take a long time to makefriends.  These people hurried in and out without seeking thepleasures of friendship.  It was no gathering or lounging place.Whole days and weeks passed without one such hearty greeting ashe had been wont to enjoy every day in Chicago.
　　For another thing, Hurstwood missed the celebrities--those well-dressed, elite individuals who lend grace to the average bars andbring news from far-off and exclusive circles.  He did not seeone such in a month.  Evenings, when still at his post, he wouldoccasionally read in the evening papers incidents concerningcelebrities whom he knew--whom he had drunk a glass with many atime.  They would visit a bar like Fitzgerald and Moy's inChicago, or the Hoffman House, uptown, but he knew that he wouldnever see them down here.Again, the business did not pay as well as he thought.  Itincreased a little, but he found he would have to watch hishousehold expenses, which was humiliating.
　　In the very beginning it was a delight to go home late at night,as he did, and find Carrie.  He managed to run up and take dinnerwith her between six and seven, and to remain home until nineo'clock in the morning, but the novelty of this waned after atime, and he began to feel the drag of his duties.
　　The first month had scarcely passed before Carrie said in a verynatural way: "I think I'll go down this week and buy a dress.'
　　"What kind?" said Hurstwood.
　　"Oh, something for street wear."
　　"All right," he answered, smiling, although he noted mentallythat it would be more agreeable to his finances if she didn't.Nothing was said about it the next day, but the following morninghe asked:
　　"Have you done anything about your dress?"
　　"Not yet," said Carrie.
　　He paused a few moments, as if in thought, and then said:
　　"Would you mind putting it off a few days?"
　　"No," replied Carrie, who did not catch the drift of his remarks.She had never thought of him in connection with money troublesbefore.  "Why?"
　　"Well, I'll tell you," said Hurstwood.  "This investment of mineis taking a lot of money just now.  I expect to get it all backshortly, but just at present I am running close."
　　"Oh!" answered Carrie.  "Why, certainly, dear.  Why didn't youtell me before?"
　　"It wasn't necessary," said Hurstwood.
　　For all her acquiescence, there was something about the wayHurstwood spoke which reminded Carrie of Drouet and his littledeal which he was always about to put through.  It was only thethought of a second, but it was a beginning.  It was somethingnew in her thinking of Hurstwood.
　　Other things followed from time to time, little things of thesame sort, which in their cumulative effect were eventually equalto a full revelation.  Carrie was not dull by any means.  Twopersons cannot long dwell together without coming to anunderstanding of one another.  The mental difficulties of anindividual reveal themselves whether he voluntarily confessesthem or not.  Trouble gets in the air and contributes gloom,which speaks for itself.  Hurstwood dressed as nicely as usual,but they were the same clothes he had in Canada.  Carrie noticedthat he did not install a large wardrobe, though his own wasanything but large.  She noticed, also, that he did not suggestmany amusements, said nothing about the food, seemed concernedabout his business.  This was not the easy Hurstwood of Chicago--not the liberal, opulent Hurstwood she had known.  The change wastoo obvious to escape detection.
　　In time she began to feel that a change had come about, and thatshe was not in his confidence.  He was evidently secretive andkept his own counsel.  She found herself asking him questionsabout little things.  This is a disagreeable state to a woman.Great love makes it seem reasonable, sometimes plausible, butnever satisfactory.  Where great love is not, a more definite andless satisfactory conclusion is reached.
　　As for Hurstwood, he was making a great fight against thedifficulties of a changed condition.  He was too shrewd not torealise the tremendous mistake he had made, and appreciate thathe had done well in getting where he was, and yet he could nothelp contrasting his present state with his former, hour afterhour, and day after day.
　　Besides, he had the disagreeable fear of meeting old-timefriends, ever since one such encounter which he made shortlyafter his arrival in the city.  It was in Broadway that he saw aman approaching him whom he knew.  There was no time forsimulating non-recognition.  The exchange of glances had been toosharp, the knowledge of each other too apparent.  So the friend,a buyer for one of the Chicago wholesale houses, felt, perforce,the necessity of stopping.
　　"How are you?" he said, extending his hand with an evidentmixture of feeling and a lack of plausible interest.
　　"Very well," said Hurstwood, equally embarrassed.  "How is itwith you?"
　　"All right; I'm down here doing a little buying.  Are you locatedhere now?"
　　"Yes," said Hurstwood, "I have a place down in Warren Street."
　　"Is that so?" said the friend.  "Glad to hear it.  I'll come downand see you."
　　"Do," said Hurstwood.
　　"So long," said the other, smiling affably and going on.
　　"He never asked for my number," thought Hurstwood; "he wouldn'tthink of coming." He wiped his forehead, which had grown damp,and hoped sincerely he would meet no one else.
　　These things told upon his good-nature, such as it was.  His onehope was that things would change for the better in a money way.
　　He had Carrie.  His furniture was being paid for.  He wasmaintaining his position.  As for Carrie, the amusements he couldgive her would have to do for the present.  He could probablykeep up his pretensions sufficiently long without exposure tomake good, and then all would be well.  He failed therein to takeaccount of the frailties of human nature--the difficulties ofmatrimonial life.  Carrie was young.  With him and with hervarying mental states were common.  At any moment the extremes offeeling might be anti-polarised at the dinner table.  This oftenhappens in the best regulated families.  Little things broughtout on such occasions need great love to obliterate themafterward.  Where that is not, both parties count two and two andmake a problem after a while.
　　Chapter XXXI
　　A PET OF GOOD FORTUNE--BROADWAY FLAUNTS ITS JOYS
　　The effect of the city and his own situation on Hurstwood wasparalleled in the case of Carrie, who accepted the things whichfortune provided with the most genial good-nature.  New York,despite her first expression of disapproval, soon interested herexceedingly.  Its clear atmosphere, more populous thoroughfares,and peculiar indifference struck her forcibly.  She had neverseen such a little flat as hers, and yet it soon enlisted heraffection.  The new furniture made an excellent showing, thesideboard which Hurstwood himself arranged gleamed brightly.  Thefurniture for each room was appropriate, and in the so-calledparlour, or front room, was installed a piano, because Carriesaid she would like to learn to play.  She kept a servant anddeveloped rapidly in household tactics and information.  For thefirst time in her life she felt settled, and somewhat justifiedin the eyes of society as she conceived of it.  Her thoughts weremerry and innocent enough.  For a long while she concernedherself over the arrangement of New York flats, and wondered atten families living in one building and all remaining strange andindifferent to each other.  She also marvelled at the whistles ofthe hundreds of vessels in the harbour--the long, low cries ofthe Sound steamers and ferry-boats when fog was on.  The merefact that these things spoke from the sea made them wonderful.She looked much at what she could see of the Hudson from her westwindows and of the great city building up rapidly on either hand.It was much to ponder over, and sufficed to entertain her formore than a year without becoming stale.
　　For another thing, Hurstwood was exceedingly interesting in hisaffection for her.  Troubled as he was, he never exposed hisdifficulties to her.  He carried himself with the same self-important air, took his new state with easy familiarity, andrejoiced in Carrie's proclivities and successes.  Each evening hearrived promptly to dinner, and found the little dining-room amost inviting spectacle.  In a way, the smallness of the roomadded to its luxury.  It looked full and replete.  The white-covered table was arrayed with pretty dishes and lighted with afour-armed candelabra, each light of which was topped with a redshade.  Between Carrie and the girl the steaks and chops came outall right, and canned goods did the rest for a while.  Carriestudied the art of making biscuit, and soon reached the stagewhere she could show a plate of light, palatable morsels for herlabour.
　　In this manner the second, third, and fourth months passed.Winter came, and with it a feeling that indoors was best, so thatthe attending of theatres was not much talked of.  Hurstwood madegreat efforts to meet all expenditures without a show of feelingone way or the other.  He pretended that he was reinvesting hismoney in strengthening the business for greater ends in thefuture.  He contented himself with a very moderate allowance ofpersonal apparel, and rarely suggested anything for Carrie.  Thusthe first winter passed.
　　In the second year, the business which Hurstwood managed didincrease somewhat.  He got out of it regularly the $150 per monthwhich he had anticipated.  Unfortunately, by this time Carrie hadreached certain conclusions, and he had scraped up a fewacquaintances.
　　Being of a passive and receptive rather than an active andaggressive nature, Carrie accepted the situation.  Her stateseemed satisfactory enough.  Once in a while they would go to atheatre together, occasionally in season to the beaches anddifferent points about the city, but they picked up noacquaintances.  Hurstwood naturally abandoned his show of finemanners with her and modified his attitude to one of easyfamiliarity.  There were no misunderstandings, no apparentdifferences of opinion.  In fact, without money or visitingfriends, he led a life which could neither arouse jealousy norcomment.  Carrie rather sympathised with his efforts and thoughtnothing upon her lack of entertainment such as she had enjoyed inChicago.  New York as a corporate entity and her flat temporarilyseemed sufficient.
　　However, as Hurstwood's business increased, he, as stated, beganto pick up acquaintances.  He also began to allow himself moreclothes.  He convinced himself that his home life was veryprecious to him, but allowed that he could occasionally stay awayfrom dinner.  The first time he did this he sent a message sayingthat he would be detained.  Carrie ate alone, and wished that itmight not happen again.  The second time, also, he sent word, butat the last moment.  The third time he forgot entirely andexplained afterwards.  These events were months apart, each.
　　"Where were you, George?" asked Carrie, after the first absence.
　　"Tied up at the office," he said genially.  "There were someaccounts I had to straighten."
　　"I'm sorry you couldn't get home," she said kindly.  "I wasfixing to have such a nice dinner."
　　The second time he gave a similar excuse, but the third time thefeeling about it in Carrie's mind was a little bit out of theordinary.
　　"I couldn't get home," he said, when he came in later in theevening, "I was so busy."
　　"Couldn't you have sent me word?" asked Carrie.
　　"I meant to," he said, "but you know I forgot it until it was toolate to do any good."
　　"And I had such a good dinner!" said Carrie.
　　Now, it so happened that from his observations of Carrie he beganto imagine that she was of the thoroughly domestic type of mind.He really thought, after a year, that her chief expression inlife was finding its natural channel in household duties.Notwithstanding the fact that he had observed her act in Chicago,and that during the past year he had only seen her limited in herrelations to her flat and him by conditions which he made, andthat she had not gained any friends or associates, he drew thispeculiar conclusion.  With it came a feeling of satisfaction inhaving a wife who could thus be content, and this satisfactionworked its natural result.  That is, since he imagined he saw hersatisfied, he felt called upon to give only that whichcontributed to such satisfaction.  He supplied the furniture, thedecorations, the food, and the necessary clothing.  Thoughts ofentertaining her, leading her out into the shine and show oflife, grew less and less.  He felt attracted to the outer world,but did not think she would care to go along.  Once he went tothe theatre alone.  Another time he joined a couple of his newfriends at an evening game of poker.  Since his money-featherswere beginning to grow again he felt like sprucing about.  Allthis, however, in a much less imposing way than had been his wontin Chicago.  He avoided the gay places where he would be apt tomeet those who had known him.Now, Carrie began to feel this in various sensory ways.  She wasnot the kind to be seriously disturbed by his actions.  Notloving him greatly, she could not be jealous in a disturbing way.In fact, she was not jealous at all.  Hurstwood was pleased withher placid manner, when he should have duly considered it.  Whenhe did not come home it did not seem anything like a terriblething to her.  She gave him credit for having the usualallurements of men--people to talk to, places to stop, friends toconsult with.  She was perfectly willing that he should enjoyhimself in his way, but she did not care to be neglected herself.Her state still seemed fairly reasonable, however.  All she didobserve was that Hurstwood was somewhat different.
　　Some time in the second year of their residence in Seventy-eighthStreet the flat across the hall from Carrie became vacant, andinto it moved a very handsome young woman and her husband, withboth of whom Carrie afterwards became acquainted.  This wasbrought about solely by the arrangement of the flats, which wereunited in one place, as it were, by the dumb-waiter.  This usefulelevator, by which fuel, groceries, and the like were sent upfrom the basement, and garbage and waste sent down, was used byboth residents of one floor; that is, a small door opened into itfrom each flat.
　　If the occupants of both flats answered to the whistle of thejanitor at the same time, they would stand face to face when theyopened the dumb-waiter doors.  One morning, when Carrie went toremove her paper, the newcomer, a handsome brunette of perhapstwenty-three years of age, was there for a like purpose.  She wasin a night-robe and dressing-gown, with her hair very muchtousled, but she looked so pretty and good-natured that Carrieinstantly conceived a liking for her.  The newcomer did no morethan smile shamefacedly, but it was sufficient.  Carrie felt thatshe would like to know her, and a similar feeling stirred in themind of the other, who admired Carrie's innocent face.
　　"That's a real pretty woman who has moved in next door," saidCarrie to Hurstwood at the breakfast table.
　　"Who are they?" asked Hurstwood.
　　"I don't know," said Carrie.  "The name on the bell is Vance.Some one over there plays beautifully.  I guess it must be she."
　　"Well, you never can tell what sort of people you're living nextto in this town, can you?" said Hurstwood, expressing thecustomary New York opinion about neighbours.
　　"Just think," said Carrie, "I have been in this house with nineother families for over a year and I don't know a soul.  Thesepeople have been here over a month and I haven't seen any onebefore this morning."
　　"It's just as well," said Hurstwood.  'You never know who you'regoing to get in with.  Some of these people are pretty badcompany."
　　"I expect so," said Carrie, agreeably.
　　The conversation turned to other things, and Carrie thought nomore upon the subject until a day or two later, when, going outto market, she encountered Mrs. Vance coming in.  The latterrecognised her and nodded, for which Carrie returned a smile.This settled the probability of acquaintanceship.  If there hadbeen no faint recognition on this occasion, there would have beenno future association.
　　Carrie saw no more of Mrs. Vance for several weeks, but she heardher play through the thin walls which divided the front rooms ofthe flats, and was pleased by the merry selection of pieces andthe brilliance of their rendition.  She could play onlymoderately herself, and such variety as Mrs. Vance exercisedbordered, for Carrie, upon the verge of great art.  Everythingshe had seen and heard thus far--the merest scraps and shadows--indicated that these people were, in a measure, refined and incomfortable circumstances.  So Carrie was ready for any extensionof the friendship which might follow.
　　One day Carrie's bell rang and the servant, who was in thekitchen, pressed the button which caused the front door of thegeneral entrance on the ground floor to be electricallyunlatched.  When Carrie waited at her own door on the third floorto see who it might be coming up to call on her, Mrs. Vanceappeared.
　　"I hope you'll excuse me," she said.  "I went out a while ago andforgot my outside key, so I thought I'd ring your bell."
　　This was a common trick of other residents of the building,whenever they had forgotten their outside keys.  They did notapologise for it, however.
　　"Certainly," said Carrie.  "I'm glad you did.  I do the samething sometimes."
　　"Isn't it just delightful weather?" said Mrs. Vance, pausing fora moment.
　　Thus, after a few more preliminaries, this visiting acquaintancewas well launched, and in the young Mrs. Vance Carrie found anagreeable companion.
　　On several occasions Carrie visited her and was visited.  Bothflats were good to look upon, though that of the Vances tendedsomewhat more to the luxurious.
　　"I want you to come over this evening and meet my husband," saidMrs. Vance, not long after their intimacy began.  "He wants tomeet you.  You play cards, don't you?"
　　"A little," said Carrie.
　　"Well, we'll have a game of cards.  If your husband comes homebring him over."
　　"He's not coming to dinner to-night," said Carrie.
　　"Well, when he does come we'll call him in."
　　Carrie acquiesced, and that evening met the portly Vance, anindividual a few years younger than Hurstwood, and who owed hisseemingly comfortable matrimonial state much more to his moneythan to his good looks.  He thought well of Carrie upon the firstglance and laid himself out to be genial, teaching her a new gameof cards and talking to her about New York and its pleasures.Mrs. Vance played some upon the piano, and at last Hurstwoodcame.
　　"I am very glad to meet you," he said to Mrs. Vance when Carrieintroduced him, showing much of the old grace which hadcaptivated Carrie."Did you think your wife had run away?" said Mr. Vance, extendinghis hand upon introduction.
　　"I didn't know but what she might have found a better husband,"said Hurstwood.
　　He now turned his attention to Mrs. Vance, and in a flash Carriesaw again what she for some time had subconsciously missed inHurstwood--the adroitness and flattery of which he was capable.She also saw that she was not well dressed--not nearly as welldressed--as Mrs. Vance.  These were not vague ideas any longer.Her situation was cleared up for her.  She felt that her life wasbecoming stale, and therein she felt cause for gloom.  The oldhelpful, urging melancholy was restored.  The desirous Carrie waswhispered to concerning her possibilities.
　　There were no immediate results to this awakening, for Carrie hadlittle power of initiative; but, nevertheless, she seemed evercapable of getting herself into the tide of change where shewould be easily borne along.  Hurstwood noticed nothing.  He hadbeen unconscious of the marked contrasts which Carrie hadobserved.
　　He did not even detect the shade of melancholy which settled inher eyes.  Worst of all, she now began to feel the loneliness ofthe flat and seek the company of Mrs. Vance, who liked herexceedingly.
　　"Let's go to the matinee this afternoon," said Mrs. Vance, whohad stepped across into Carrie's flat one morning, still arrayedin a soft pink dressing-gown, which she had donned upon rising.Hurstwood and Vance had gone their separate ways nearly an hourbefore.
　　"All right," said Carrie, noticing the air of the petted andwell-groomed woman in Mrs. Vance's general appearance.  Shelooked as though she was dearly loved and her every wishgratified.  "What shall we see?"
　　"Oh, I do want to see Nat Goodwin," said Mrs. Vance.  "I do thinkhe is the jolliest actor.  The papers say this is such a goodplay."
　　"What time will we have to start?" asked Carrie.
　　"Let's go at once and walk down Broadway from Thirty-fourthStreet," said Mrs. Vance.  "It's such an interesting walk.  He'sat the Madison Square."
　　"I'll be glad to go," said Carrie.  "How much will we have to payfor seats?"
　　"Not more than a dollar," said Mrs. Vance.
　　The latter departed, and at one o'clock reappeared, stunninglyarrayed in a dark-blue walking dress, with a nobby hat to match.Carrie had gotten herself up charmingly enough, but this womanpained her by contrast.  She seemed to have so many dainty littlethings which Carrie had not.  There were trinkets of gold, anelegant green leather purse set with her initials, a fancyhandkerchief, exceedingly rich in design, and the like.  Carriefelt that she needed more and better clothes to compare with thiswoman, and that any one looking at the two would pick Mrs. Vancefor her raiment alone.  It was a trying, though rather unjustthought, for Carrie had now developed an equally pleasing figure,and had grown in comeliness until she was a thoroughly attractivetype of her colour of beauty.  There was some difference in theclothing of the two, both of quality and age, but this differencewas not especially noticeable.  It served, however, to augmentCarrie's dissatisfaction with her state.
　　The walk down Broadway, then as now, was one of the remarkablefeatures of the city.  There gathered, before the matinee andafterwards, not only all the pretty women who love a showyparade, but the men who love to gaze upon and admire them.  Itwas a very imposing procession of pretty faces and fine clothes.Women appeared in their very best hats, shoes, and gloves, andwalked arm in arm on their way to the fine shops or theatresstrung along from Fourteenth to Thirty-fourth Streets.  Equallythe men paraded with the very latest they could afford.  A tailormight have secured hints on suit measurements, a shoemaker onproper lasts and colours, a hatter on hats.  It was literallytrue that if a lover of fine clothes secured a new suit, it wassure to have its first airing on Broadway.  So true and wellunderstood was this fact, that several years later a popularsong, detailing this and other facts concerning the afternoonparade on matinee days, and entitled "What Right Has He onBroadway?" was published, and had quite a vogue about the music-halls of the city.
　　In all her stay in the city, Carrie had never heard of this showyparade; had never even been on Broadway when it was taking place.On the other hand, it was a familiar thing to Mrs. Vance, who notonly knew of it as an entity, but had often been in it, goingpurposely to see and be seen, to create a stir with her beautyand dispel any tendency to fall short in dressiness bycontrasting herself with the beauty and fashion of the town.
　　Carrie stepped along easily enough after they got out of the carat Thirty-fourth Street, but soon fixed her eyes upon the lovelycompany which swarmed by and with them as they proceeded.  Shenoticed suddenly that Mrs. Vance's manner had rather stiffenedunder the gaze of handsome men and elegantly dressed ladies,whose glances were not modified by any rules of propriety.  Tostare seemed the proper and natural thing.  Carrie found herselfstared at and ogled.  Men in flawless top-coats, high hats, andsilver-headed walking sticks elbowed near and looked too ofteninto conscious eyes.  Ladies rustled by in dresses of stiffcloth, shedding affected smiles and perfume.  Carrie noticedamong them the sprinkling of goodness and the heavy percentage ofvice.  The rouged and powdered cheeks and lips, the scented hair,the large, misty, and languorous eye, were common enough.  With astart she awoke to find that she was in fashion's crowd, onparade in a show place--and such a show place! Jewellers' windowsgleamed along the path with remarkable frequency.  Florist shops,furriers, haberdashers, confectioners--all followed in rapidsuccession.  The street was full of coaches.  Pompous doormen inimmense coats, shiny brass belts and buttons, waited in front ofexpensive salesrooms.  Coachmen in tan boots, white tights, andblue jackets waited obsequiously for the mistresses of carriageswho were shopping inside.  The whole street bore the flavour ofriches and show, and Carrie felt that she was not of it.  Shecould not, for the life of her, assume the attitude and smartnessof Mrs. Vance, who, in her beauty, was all assurance.  She couldonly imagine that it must be evident to many that she was theless handsomely dressed of the two.  It cut her to the quick, andshe resolved that she would not come here again until she lookedbetter.  At the same time she longed to feel the delight ofparading here as an equal.  Ah, then she would be happy!
　　Chapter XXXII
　　THE FEAST OF BELSHAZZAR--A SEER TO TRANSLATE
　　Such feelings as were generated in Carrie by this walk put her inan exceedingly receptive mood for the pathos which followed inthe play.  The actor whom they had gone to see had achieved hispopularity by presenting a mellow type of comedy, in whichsufficient sorrow was introduced to lend contrast and relief tohumour. For Carrie, as we well know, the stage had a greatattraction.  She had never forgotten her one histrionicachievement in Chicago.  It dwelt in her mind and occupied herconsciousness during many long afternoons in which her rocking-chair and her latest novel contributed the only pleasures of herstate.  Never could she witness a play without having her ownability vividly brought to consciousness.  Some scenes made herlong to be a part of them--to give expression to the feelingswhich she, in the place of the character represented, would feel.Almost invariably she would carry the vivid imaginations awaywith her and brood over them the next day alone.  She lived asmuch in these things as in the realities which made up her dailylife.
　　It was not often that she came to the play stirred to her heart'score by actualities.  To-day a low song of longing had been setsinging in her heart by the finery, the merriment, the beauty shehad seen.  Oh, these women who had passed her by, hundreds andhundreds strong, who were they? Whence came the rich, elegantdresses, the astonishingly coloured buttons, the knick-knacks ofsilver and gold? Where were these lovely creatures housed? Amidwhat elegancies of carved furniture, decorated walls, elaboratetapestries did they move? Where were their rich apartments,loaded with all that money could provide? In what stables champedthese sleek, nervous horses and rested the gorgeous carriages?Where lounged the richly groomed footmen? Oh, the mansions, thelights, the perfume, the loaded boudoirs and tables! New Yorkmust be filled with such bowers, or the beautiful, insolent,supercilious creatures could not be.  Some hothouses held them.It ached her to know that she was not one of them--that, alas,she had dreamed a dream and it had not come true.  She wonderedat her own solitude these two years past--her indifference to thefact that she had never achieved what she had expected.
　　The play was one of those drawing-room concoctions in whichcharmingly overdressed ladies and gentlemen suffer the pangs oflove and jealousy amid gilded surroundings.  Such bon-mots areever enticing to those who have all their days longed for suchmaterial surroundings and have never had them gratified.  Theyhave the charm of showing suffering under ideal conditions.  Whowould not grieve upon a gilded chair? Who would not suffer amidperfumed tapestries, cushioned furniture, and liveried servants?Grief under such circumstances becomes an enticing thing.  Carrielonged to be of it.  She wanted to take her sufferings, whateverthey were, in such a world, or failing that, at least to simulatethem under such charming conditions upon the stage.  So affectedwas her mind by what she had seen, that the play now seemed anextraordinarily beautiful thing.  She was soon lost in the worldit represented, and wished that she might never return.  Betweenthe acts she studied the galaxy of matinee attendants in frontrows and boxes, and conceived a new idea of the possibilities ofNew York.  She was sure she had not seen it all--that the citywas one whirl of pleasure and delight.
　　Going out, the same Broadway taught her a sharper lesson.  Thescene she had witnessed coming down was now augmented and at itsheight.  Such a crush of finery and folly she had never seen.  Itclinched her convictions concerning her state.  She had notlived, could not lay claim to having lived, until something ofthis had come into her own life.  Women were spending money likewater; she could see that in every elegant shop she passed.Flowers, candy, jewelry, seemed the principal things in which theelegant dames were interested.  And she--she had scarcely enoughpin money to indulge in such outings as this a few times a month.
　　That night the pretty little flat seemed a commonplace thing.  Itwas not what the rest of the world was enjoying.  She saw theservant working at dinner with an indifferent eye.  In her mindwere running scenes of the play.  Particularly she remembered onebeautiful actress--the sweetheart who had been wooed and won.The grace of this woman had won Carrie's heart.  Her dresses hadbeen all that art could suggest, her sufferings had been so real.The anguish which she had portrayed Carrie could feel.  It wasdone as she was sure she could do it.  There were places in whichshe could even do better.  Hence she repeated the lines toherself.  Oh, if she could only have such a part, how broad wouldbe her life! She, too, could act appealingly.
　　When Hurstwood came, Carrie was moody.  She was sitting, rockingand thinking, and did not care to have her enticing imaginationsbroken in upon; so she said little or nothing.
　　"What's the matter, Carrie?" said Hurstwood after a time,noticing her quiet, almost moody state.
　　"Nothing," said Carrie.  "I don't feel very well tonight."
　　"Not sick, are you?" he asked, approaching very close.
　　"Oh, no," she said, almost pettishly, "I just don't feel verygood."
　　"That's too bad," he said, stepping away and adjusting his vestafter his slight bending over.  "I was thinking we might go to ashow to-night."
　　"I don't want to go," said Carrie, annoyed that her fine visionsshould have thus been broken into and driven out of her mind."I've been to the matinee this afternoon."
　　"Oh, you have?" said Hurstwood.  "What was it?"
　　"A Gold Mine."
　　"How was it?"
　　"Pretty good," said Carrie.
　　"And you don't want to go again to night?"
　　"I don't think I do," she said.
　　Nevertheless, wakened out of her melancholia and called to thedinner table, she changed her mind.  A little food in the stomachdoes wonders.  She went again, and in so doing temporarilyrecovered her equanimity.  The great awakening blow had, however,been delivered.  As often as she might recover from thesediscontented thoughts now, they would occur again.  Time andrepetition--ah, the wonder of it! The dropping water and thesolid stone--how utterly it yields at last!
　　Not long after this matinee experience--perhaps a month--Mrs.Vance invited Carrie to an evening at the theatre with them.  Sheheard Carrie say that Hurstwood was not coming home to dinner.
　　"Why don't you come with us? Don't get dinner for yourself.We're going down to Sherry's for dinner and then over to theLyceum.  Come along with us."
　　"I think I will," answered Carrie.
　　She began to dress at three o'clock for her departure at half-past five for the noted dining-room which was then crowdingDelmonico's for position in society.  In this dressing Carrieshowed the influence of her association with the dashing Mrs.Vance.  She had constantly had her attention called by the latterto novelties in everything which pertains to a woman's apparel.
　　"Are you going to get such and such a hat?" or, "Have you seenthe new gloves with the oval pearl buttons?" were but samplephrases out of a large selection.
　　"The next time you get a pair of shoes, dearie," said Mrs. Vance,"get button, with thick soles and patent-leather tips.  They'reall the rage this fall."
　　"I will," said Carrie.
　　"Oh, dear, have you seen the new shirtwaists at Altman's? Theyhave some of the loveliest patterns.  I saw one there that I knowwould look stunning on you.  I said so when I saw it."
　　Carrie listened to these things with considerable interest, forthey were suggested with more of friendliness than is usuallycommon between pretty women.  Mrs. Vance liked Carrie's stablegood-nature so well that she really took pleasure in suggestingto her the latest things.
　　"Why don't you get yourself one of those nice serge skirtsthey're selling at Lord & Taylor's?" she said one day.  "They'rethe circular style, and they're going to be worn from now on.  Adark blue one would look so nice on you."
　　Carrie listened with eager ears.  These things never came upbetween her and Hurstwood.  Nevertheless, she began to suggestone thing and another, which Hurstwood agreed to without anyexpression of opinion.  He noticed the new tendency on Carrie'spart, and finally, hearing much of Mrs. Vance and her delightfulways, suspected whence the change came.  He was not inclined tooffer the slightest objection so soon, but he felt that Carrie'swants were expanding.  This did not appeal to him exactly, but hecared for her in his own way, and so the thing stood.  Still,there was something in the details of the transactions whichcaused Carrie to feel that her requests were not a delight tohim.  He did not enthuse over the purchases.  This led her tobelieve that neglect was creeping in, and so another small wedgewas entered.
　　Nevertheless, one of the results of Mrs. Vance's suggestions wasthe fact that on this occasion Carrie was dressed somewhat to herown satisfaction.  She had on her best, but there was comfort inthe thought that if she must confine herself to a best, it wasneat and fitting.  She looked the well-groomed woman of twenty-one, and Mrs. Vance praised her, which brought colour to herplump cheeks and a noticeable brightness into her large eyes.  Itwas threatening rain, and Mr. Vance, at his wife's request, hadcalled a coach."Your husband isn't coming?" suggested Mr. Vance, as he metCarrie in his little parlour.
　　"No; he said he wouldn't be home for dinner."
　　"Better leave a little note for him, telling him where we are.He might turn up."
　　"I will," said Carrie, who had not thought of it before.
　　"Tell him we'll be at Sherry's until eight o'clock.  He knows,though I guess."
　　Carrie crossed the hall with rustling skirts, and scrawled thenote, gloves on.  When she returned a newcomer was in the Vanceflat.
　　"Mrs. Wheeler, let me introduce Mr. Ames, a cousin of mine," saidMrs. Vance.  "He's going along with us, aren't you, Bob?"
　　"I'm very glad to meet you," said Ames, bowing politely toCarrie.
　　The latter caught in a glance the dimensions of a very stalwartfigure.  She also noticed that he was smooth-shaven, goodlooking, and young, but nothing more.
　　"Mr. Ames is just down in New York for a few days," put in Vance,"and we're trying to show him around a little."
　　"Oh, are you?" said Carrie, taking another glance at thenewcomer.
　　"Yes; I am just on here from Indianapolis for a week or so," saidyoung Ames, seating himself on the edge of a chair to wait whileMrs. Vance completed the last touches of her toilet.
　　"I guess you find New York quite a thing to see, don't you?" saidCarrie, venturing something to avoid a possible deadly silence.
　　"It is rather large to get around in a week," answered Ames,pleasantly.
　　He was an exceedingly genial soul, this young man, and whollyfree of affectation.  It seemed to Carrie he was as yet onlyovercoming the last traces of the bashfulness of youth.  He didnot seem apt at conversation, but he had the merit of being welldressed and wholly courageous.  Carrie felt as if it were notgoing to be hard to talk to him.
　　"Well, I guess we're ready now.  The coach is outside."
　　"Come on, people," said Mrs. Vance, coming in smiling.  "Bob,you'll have to look after Mrs. Wheeler."
　　"I'll try to," said Bob smiling, and edging closer to Carrie."You won't need much watching, will you?" he volunteered, in asort of ingratiating and help-me-out kind of way.
　　"Not very, I hope," said Carrie.
　　They descended the stairs, Mrs. Vance offering suggestions, andclimbed into the open coach.
　　"All right," said Vance, slamming the coach door, and theconveyance rolled away.
　　"What is it we're going to see?" asked Ames.
　　"Sothern," said Vance, "in 'Lord Chumley.'"
　　"Oh, he is so good!" said Mrs. Vance.  "He's just the funniestman."
　　"I notice the papers praise it," said Ames.
　　"I haven't any doubt," put in Vance, "but we'll all enjoy it verymuch."
　　Ames had taken a seat beside Carrie, and accordingly he felt ithis bounden duty to pay her some attention.  He was interested tofind her so young a wife, and so pretty, though it was only arespectful interest.  There was nothing of the dashing lady's manabout him.  He had respect for the married state, and thoughtonly of some pretty marriageable girls in Indianapolis.
　　"Are you a born New Yorker?" asked Ames of Carrie.
　　"Oh, no; I've only been here for two years."
　　"Oh, well, you've had time to see a great deal of it, anyhow."
　　"I don't seem to have," answered Carrie.  "It's about as strangeto me as when I first came here."
　　"You're not from the West, are you?"
　　"Yes.  I'm from Wisconsin," she answered.
　　"Well, it does seem as if most people in this town haven't beenhere so very long.  I hear of lots of Indiana people in my linewho are here."
　　"What is your line?" asked Carrie.
　　"I'm connected with an electrical company," said the youth.
　　Carrie followed up this desultory conversation with occasionalinterruptions from the Vances.  Several times it became generaland partially humorous, and in that manner the restaurant wasreached.
　　Carrie had noticed the appearance of gayety and pleasure-seekingin the streets which they were following.  Coaches were numerous,pedestrians many, and in Fifty-ninth Street the street cars werecrowded.  At Fifty-ninth Street and Fifth Avenue a blaze oflights from several new hotels which bordered the Plaza Squaregave a suggestion of sumptuous hotel life.  Fifth Avenue, thehome of the wealthy, was noticeably crowded with carriages, andgentlemen in evening dress.  At Sherry's an imposing doormanopened the coach door and helped them out.  Young Ames heldCarrie's elbow as he helped her up the steps.  They entered thelobby already swarming with patrons, and then, after divestingthemselves of their wraps, went into a sumptuous dining-room.
　　In all Carrie's experience she had never seen anything like this.In the whole time she had been in New York Hurstwood's modifiedstate had not permitted his bringing her to such a place.  Therewas an almost indescribable atmosphere about it which convincedthe newcomer that this was the proper thing.  Here was the placewhere the matter of expense limited the patrons to the moneyed orpleasure-loving class.  Carrie had read of it often in the"Morning" and "Evening World." She had seen notices of dances,parties, balls, and suppers at Sherry's.  The Misses So-and-sowould give a party on Wednesday evening at Sherry's.  Young Mr.So-and-So would entertain a party of friends at a privateluncheon on the sixteenth, at Sherry's.  The common run ofconventional, perfunctory notices of the doings of society, whichshe could scarcely refrain from scanning each day, had given hera distinct idea of the gorgeousness and luxury of this wonderfultemple of gastronomy.  Now, at last, she was really in it.  Shehad come up the imposing steps, guarded by the large and portlydoorman.  She had seen the lobby, guarded by another large andportly gentleman, and been waited upon by uniformed youths whotook care of canes, overcoats, and the like.  Here was thesplendid dining-chamber, all decorated and aglow, where thewealthy ate.  Ah, how fortunate was Mrs. Vance; young, beautiful,and well off--at least, sufficiently so to come here in a coach.What a wonderful thing it was to be rich.
　　Vance led the way through lanes of shining tables, at which wereseated parties of two, three, four, five, or six.  The air ofassurance and dignity about it all was exceedingly noticeable tothe novitiate.  Incandescent lights, the reflection of their glowin polished glasses, and the shine of gilt upon the walls,combined into one tone of light which it requires minutes ofcomplacent observation to separate and take particular note of.The white shirt fronts of the gentlemen, the bright costumes ofthe ladies, diamonds, jewels, fine feathers--all were exceedinglynoticeable.
　　Carrie walked with an air equal to that of Mrs. Vance, andaccepted the seat which the head waiter provided for her.  Shewas keenly aware of all the little things that were done--thelittle genuflections and attentions of the waiters and headwaiter which Americans pay for.  The air with which the latterpulled out each chair, and the wave of the hand with which hemotioned them to be seated, were worth several dollars inthemselves.
　　Once seated, there began that exhibition of showy, wasteful, andunwholesome gastronomy as practised by wealthy Americans, whichis the wonder and astonishment of true culture and dignity theworld over.  The large bill of fare held an array of dishessufficient to feed an army, sidelined with prices which madereasonable expenditure a ridiculous impossibility--an order ofsoup at fifty cents or a dollar, with a dozen kinds to choosefrom; oysters in forty styles and at sixty cents the half-dozen;entrees, fish, and meats at prices which would house one overnight in an average hotel.  One dollar fifty and two dollarsseemed to be the most common figures upon this most tastefullyprinted bill of fare.
　　Carrie noticed this, and in scanning it the price of springchicken carried her back to that other bill of fare and fardifferent occasion when, for the first time, she sat with Drouetin a good restaurant in Chicago.  It was only momentary--a sadnote as out of an old song--and then it was gone.  But in thatflash was seen the other Carrie--poor, hungry, drifting at herwits' ends, and all Chicago a cold and closed world, from whichshe only wandered because she could not find work.
　　On the walls were designs in colour, square spots of robin's-eggblue, set in ornate frames of gilt, whose corners were elaboratemouldings of fruit and flowers, with fat cupids hovering inangelic comfort.  On the ceilings were coloured traceries withmore gilt, leading to a centre where spread a cluster of lights--incandescent globes mingled with glittering prisms and stuccotendrils of gilt.  The floor was of a reddish hue, waxed andpolished, and in every direction were mirrors--tall, brilliant,bevel-edged mirrors--reflecting and re-reflecting forms, faces,and candelabra a score and a hundred times.
　　The tables were not so remarkable in themselves, and yet theimprint of Sherry upon the napery, the name of Tiffany upon thesilverware, the name of Haviland upon the china, and over all theglow of the small, red-shaded candelabra and the reflected tintsof the walls on garments and faces, made them seem remarkable.Each waiter added an air of exclusiveness and elegance by themanner in which he bowed, scraped, touched, and trifled withthings.  The exclusively personal attention which he devoted toeach one, standing half bent, ear to one side, elbows akimbo,saying: "Soup--green turtle, yes.  One portion, yes.  Oysters--certainly--half-dozen--yes.  Asparagus.  Olives--yes."
　　It would be the same with each one, only Vance essayed to orderfor all, inviting counsel and suggestions.  Carrie studied thecompany with open eyes.  So this was high life in New York.  Itwas so that the rich spent their days and evenings.  Her poorlittle mind could not rise above applying each scene to allsociety.  Every fine lady must be in the crowd on Broadway in theafternoon, in the theatre at the matinee, in the coaches anddining-halls at night.  It must be glow and shine everywhere,with coaches waiting, and footmen attending, and she was out ofit all.  In two long years she had never even been in such aplace as this.
　　Vance was in his element here, as Hurstwood would have been informer days.  He ordered freely of soup, oysters, roast meats,and side dishes, and had several bottles of wine brought, whichwere set down beside the table in a wicker basket.
　　Ames was looking away rather abstractedly at the crowd and showedan interesting profile to Carrie.  His forehead was high, hisnose rather large and strong, his chin moderately pleasing.  Hehad a good, wide, well-shaped mouth, and his dark-brown hair wasparted slightly on one side.  He seemed to have the least touchof boyishness to Carrie, and yet he was a man full grown.
　　"Do you know," he said, turning back to Carrie, after hisreflection, "I sometimes think it is a shame for people to spendso much money this way."
　　Carrie looked at him a moment with the faintest touch of surpriseat his seriousness.  He seemed to be thinking about somethingover which she had never pondered.
　　"Do you?" she answered, interestedly.
　　"Yes," he said, "they pay so much more than these things areworth.  They put on so much show."
　　"I don't know why people shouldn't spend when they have it," saidMrs. Vance.
　　"It doesn't do any harm," said Vance, who was still studying thebill of fare, though he had ordered.
　　Ames was looking away again, and Carrie was again looking at hisforehead.  To her he seemed to be thinking about strange things.As he studied the crowd his eye was mild.
　　"Look at that woman's dress over there," he said, again turningto Carrie, and nodding in a direction.
　　"Where?" said Carrie, following his eyes.
　　"Over there in the corner--way over.  Do you see that brooch?"
　　"Isn't it large?" said Carrie.
　　"One of the largest clusters of jewels I have ever seen," saidAmes.
　　"It is, isn't it?" said Carrie.  She felt as if she would like tobe agreeable to this young man, and also there came with it, orperhaps preceded it, the slightest shade of a feeling that he wasbetter educated than she was--that his mind was better.  Heseemed to look it, and the saving grace in Carrie was that shecould understand that people could be wiser.  She had seen anumber of people in her life who reminded her of what she hadvaguely come to think of as scholars.  This strong young manbeside her, with his clear, natural look, seemed to get a hold ofthings which she did not quite understand, but approved of.  Itwas fine to be so, as a man, she thought.
　　The conversation changed to a book that was having its vogue atthe time--"Moulding a Maiden," by Albert Ross.  Mrs. Vance hadread it.  Vance had seen it discussed in some of the papers.
　　"A man can make quite a strike writing a book," said Vance.  "Inotice this fellow Ross is very much talked about." He waslooking at Carrie as he spoke.
　　"I hadn't heard of him," said Carrie, honestly.
　　"Oh, I have," said Mrs. Vance.  "He's written lots of things.This last story is pretty good."
　　"He doesn't amount to much," said Ames.
　　Carrie turned her eyes toward him as to an oracle.
　　"His stuff is nearly as bad as 'Dora Thorne,'" concluded Ames.
　　Carrie felt this as a personal reproof.  She read "Dora Thorne,"or had a great deal in the past.  It seemed only fair to her, butshe supposed that people thought it very fine.  Now this clear-eyed, fine-headed youth, who looked something like a student toher, made fun of it.  It was poor to him, not worth reading.  Shelooked down, and for the first time felt the pain of notunderstanding.
　　Yet there was nothing sarcastic or supercilious in the way Amesspoke.  He had very little of that in him.  Carrie felt that itwas just kindly thought of a high order--the right thing tothink, and wondered what else was right, according to him.  Heseemed to notice that she listened and rather sympathised withhim, and from now on he talked mostly to her.
　　As the waiter bowed and scraped about, felt the dishes to see ifthey were hot enough, brought spoons and forks, and did all thoselittle attentive things calculated to impress the luxury of thesituation upon the diner, Ames also leaned slightly to one sideand told her of Indianapolis in an intelligent way.  He reallyhad a very bright mind, which was finding its chief developmentin electrical knowledge.  His sympathies for other forms ofinformation, however, and for types of people, were quick andwarm.  The red glow on his head gave it a sandy tinge and put abright glint in his eye.  Carrie noticed all these things as heleaned toward her and felt exceedingly young.  This man was farahead of her.  He seemed wiser than Hurstwood, saner and brighterthan Drouet.  He seemed innocent and clean, and she thought thathe was exceedingly pleasant.  She noticed, also, that hisinterest in her was a far-off one.  She was not in his life, norany of the things that touched his life, and yet now, as he spokeof these things, they appealed to her.
　　"I shouldn't care to be rich," he told her, as the dinnerproceeded and the supply of food warmed up his sympathies; "notrich enough to spend my money this way."
　　"Oh, wouldn't you?" said Carrie, the, to her, new attitudeforcing itself distinctly upon her for the first time.
　　"No," he said.  "What good would it do? A man doesn't need thissort of thing to be happy."
　　Carrie thought of this doubtfully; but, coming from him, it hadweight with her.
　　"He probably could be happy," she thought to herself, "all alone.He's so strong."
　　Mr. and Mrs. Vance kept up a running fire of interruptions, andthese impressive things by Ames came at odd moments.  They weresufficient, however, for the atmosphere that went with this youthimpressed itself upon Carrie without words.  There was somethingin him, or the world he moved in, which appealed to her.  Hereminded her of scenes she had seen on the stage--the sorrows andsacrifices that always went with she knew not what.  He had takenaway some of the bitterness of the contrast between this life andher life, and all by a certain calm indifference which concernedonly him.
　　As they went out, he took her arm and helped her into the coach,and then they were off again, and so to the show.
　　During the acts Carrie found herself listening to him veryattentively.  He mentioned things in the play which she mostapproved of--things which swayed her deeply.
　　"Don't you think it rather fine to be an actor?" she asked once.
　　"Yes, I do," he said, "to be a good one.  I think the theatre agreat thing."
　　Just this little approval set Carrie's heart bounding.  Ah, ifshe could only be an actress--a good one! This man was wise--heknew--and he approved of it.  If she were a fine actress, suchmen as he would approve of her.  She felt that he was good tospeak as he had, although it did not concern her at all.  She didnot know why she felt this way.
　　At the close of the show it suddenly developed that he was notgoing back with them.
　　"Oh, aren't you?" said Carrie, with an unwarrantable feeling.
　　"Oh, no," he said; "I'm stopping right around here in Thirty-third Street."
　　Carrie could not say anything else, but somehow this developmentshocked her.  She had been regretting the wane of a pleasantevening, but she had thought there was a half-hour more.  Oh, thehalf-hours, the minutes of the world; what miseries and griefsare crowded into them!
　　She said good-bye with feigned indifference.  What matter couldit make? Still, the coach seemed lorn.
　　When she went into her own flat she had this to think about.  Shedid not know whether she would ever see this man any more.  Whatdifference could it make--what difference could it make?
　　Hurstwood had returned, and was already in bed.  His clothes werescattered loosely about.  Carrie came to the door and saw him,then retreated.  She did not want to go in yet a while.  Shewanted to think.  It was disagreeable to her.
　　Back in the dining-room she sat in her chair and rocked.  Herlittle hands were folded tightly as she thought.  Through a fogof longing and conflicting desires she was beginning to see.  Oh,ye legions of hope and pity--of sorrow and pain! She was rocking,and beginning to see.
　　Chapter XXXIII
　　WITHOUT THE WALLED CITY--THE SLOPE OF THE YEARS
　　The immediate result of this was nothing.  Results from suchthings are usually long in growing.  Morning brings a change offeeling.  The existent condition invariably pleads for itself.It is only at odd moments that we get glimpses of the misery ofthings.  The heart understands when it is confronted withcontrasts.  Take them away and the ache subsides.
　　Carrie went on, leading much this same life for six monthsthereafter or more.  She did not see Ames any more.  He calledonce upon the Vances, but she only heard about it through theyoung wife.  Then he went West, and there was a gradualsubsidence of whatever personal attraction had existed.  Themental effect of the thing had not gone, however, and never wouldentirely.  She had an ideal to contrast men by--particularly menclose to her.
　　During all this time--a period rapidly approaching three years--Hurstwood had been moving along in an even path.  There was noapparent slope downward, and distinctly none upward, so far asthe casual observer might have seen.  But psychologically therewas a change, which was marked enough to suggest the future verydistinctly indeed.  This was in the mere matter of the halt hiscareer had received when he departed from Chicago.  A man'sfortune or material progress is very much the same as his bodilygrowth.  Either he is growing stronger, healthier, wiser, as theyouth approaching manhood, or he is growing weaker, older, lessincisive mentally, as the man approaching old age.  There are noother states.  Frequently there is a period between the cessationof youthful accretion and the setting in, in the case of themiddle-aged man, of the tendency toward decay when the twoprocesses are almost perfectly balanced and there is little doingin either direction.  Given time enough, however, the balancebecomes a sagging to the grave side.  Slowly at first, then witha modest momentum, and at last the graveward process is in thefull swing.  So it is frequently with man's fortune.  If itsprocess of accretion is never halted, if the balancing stage isnever reached, there will be no toppling.  Rich men are,frequently, in these days, saved from this dissolution of theirfortune by their ability to hire younger brains.  These youngerbrains look upon the interests of the fortune as their own, andso steady and direct its progress.  If each individual were leftabsolutely to the care of his own interests, and were given timeenough in which to grow exceedingly old, his fortune would passas his strength and will.  He and his would be utterly dissolvedand scattered unto the four winds of the heavens.
　　But now see wherein the parallel changes.  A fortune, like a man,is an organism which draws to itself other minds and otherstrength than that inherent in the founder.  Beside the youngminds drawn to it by salaries, it becomes allied with youngforces, which make for its existence even when the strength andwisdom of the founder are fading.  It may be conserved by thegrowth of a community or of a state.  It may be involved inproviding something for which there is a growing demand.  Thisremoves it at once beyond the special care of the founder.  Itneeds not so much foresight now as direction.  The man wanes, theneed continues or grows, and the fortune, fallen into whose handsit may, continues.  Hence, some men never recognise the turningin the tide of their abilities.  It is only in chance cases,where a fortune or a state of success is wrested from them, thatthe lack of ability to do as they did formerly becomes apparent.Hurstwood, set down under new conditions, was in a position tosee that he was no longer young.  If he did not, it was duewholly to the fact that his state was so well balanced that anabsolute change for the worse did not show.
　　Not trained to reason or introspect himself, he could not analysethe change that was taking place in his mind, and hence his body,but he felt the depression of it.  Constant comparison betweenhis old state and his new showed a balance for the worse, whichproduced a constant state of gloom or, at least, depression.Now, it has been shown experimentally that a constantly subduedframe of mind produces certain poisons in the blood, calledkatastates, just as virtuous feelings of pleasure and delightproduce helpful chemicals called anastates.  The poisonsgenerated by remorse inveigh against the system, and eventuallyproduce marked physical deterioration.  To these Hurstwood wassubject.
　　In the course of time it told upon his temper.  His eye no longerpossessed that buoyant, searching shrewdness which hadcharacterised it in Adams Street.  His step was not as sharp andfirm.  He was given to thinking, thinking, thinking.  The newfriends he made were not celebrities.  They were of a cheaper, aslightly more sensual and cruder, grade.  He could not possiblytake the pleasure in this company that he had in that of thosefine frequenters of the Chicago resort.  He was left to brood.
　　Slowly, exceedingly slowly, his desire to greet, conciliate, andmake at home these people who visited the Warren Street placepassed from him.  More and more slowly the significance of therealm he had left began to be clear.  It did not seem sowonderful to be in it when he was in it.  It had seemed very easyfor any one to get up there and have ample raiment and money tospend, but now that he was out of it, how far off it became.  Hebegan to see as one sees a city with a wall about it.  Men wereposted at the gates.  You could not get in.  Those inside did notcare to come out to see who you were.  They were so merry insidethere that all those outside were forgotten, and he was on theoutside.
　　Each day he could read in the evening papers of the doings withinthis walled city.  In the notices of passengers for Europe heread the names of eminent frequenters of his old resort.  In thetheatrical column appeared, from time to time, announcements ofthe latest successes of men he had known.  He knew that they wereat their old gayeties.  Pullmans were hauling them to and froabout the land, papers were greeting them with interestingmentions, the elegant lobbies of hotels and the glow of polisheddining-rooms were keeping them close within the walled city.  Menwhom he had known, men whom he had tipped glasses with--rich men,and he was forgotten! Who was Mr. Wheeler? What was the WarrenStreet resort? Bah!
　　If one thinks that such thoughts do not come to so common a typeof mind--that such feelings require a higher mental development--I would urge for their consideration the fact that it is thehigher mental development that does away with such thoughts.  Itis the higher mental development which induces philosophy andthat fortitude which refuses to dwell upon such things--refusesto be made to suffer by their consideration.  The common type ofmind is exceedingly keen on all matters which relate to itsphysical welfare--exceedingly keen.  It is the unintellectualmiser who sweats blood at the loss of a hundred dollars.  It isthe Epictetus who smiles when the last vestige of physicalwelfare is removed.
　　The time came, in the third year, when this thinking began toproduce results in the Warren Street place.  The tide ofpatronage dropped a little below what it had been at its bestsince he had been there.  This irritated and worried him.
　　There came a night when he confessed to Carrie that the businesswas not doing as well this month as it had the month before.This was in lieu of certain suggestions she had made concerninglittle things she wanted to buy.  She had not failed to noticethat he did not seem to consult her about buying clothes forhimself.  For the first time, it struck her as a ruse, or that hesaid it so that she would not think of asking for things.  Herreply was mild enough, but her thoughts were rebellious.  He wasnot looking after her at all.  She was depending for herenjoyment upon the Vances.
　　And now the latter announced that they were going away.  It wasapproaching spring, and they were going North.
　　"Oh, yes," said Mrs. Vance to Carrie, "we think we might as wellgive up the flat and store our things.  We'll be gone for thesummer, and it would be a useless expense.  I think we'll settlea little farther down town when we come back."
　　Carrie heard this with genuine sorrow.  She had enjoyed Mrs.Vance's companionship so much.  There was no one else in thehouse whom she knew.  Again she would be all alone.
　　Hurstwood's gloom over the slight decrease in profits and thedeparture of the Vances came together.  So Carrie had lonelinessand this mood of her husband to enjoy at the same time.  It was agrievous thing.  She became restless and dissatisfied, notexactly, as she thought, with Hurstwood, but with life.  What wasit? A very dull round indeed.  What did she have? Nothing butthis narrow, little flat.  The Vances could travel, they could dothe things worth doing, and here she was.  For what was she made,anyhow? More thought followed, and then tears--tears seemedjustified, and the only relief in the world.
　　For another period this state continued, the twain leading arather monotonous life, and then there was a slight change forthe worse.  One evening, Hurstwood, after thinking about a way tomodify Carrie's desire for clothes and the general strain uponhis ability to provide, said:
　　"I don't think I'll ever be able to do much with Shaughnessy."
　　"What's the matter?" said Carrie.
　　"Oh, he's a slow, greedy 'mick'! He won't agree to anything toimprove the place, and it won't ever pay without it."
　　"Can't you make him?" said Carrie.
　　"No; I've tried.  The only thing I can see, if I want to improve,is to get hold of a place of my own."
　　"Why don't you?" said Carrie.
　　"Well, all I have is tied up in there just now.  If I had achance to save a while I think I could open a place that wouldgive us plenty of money."
　　"Can't we save?" said Carrie.
　　"We might try it," he suggested.  "I've been thinking that ifwe'd take a smaller flat down town and live economically for ayear, I would have enough, with what I have invested, to open agood place.  Then we could arrange to live as you want to."
　　"It would suit me all right," said Carrie, who, nevertheless,felt badly to think it had come to this.  Talk of a smaller flatsounded like poverty.
　　"There are lots of nice little flats down around Sixth Avenue,below Fourteenth Street.  We might get one down there."
　　"I'll look at them if you say so," said Carrie.
　　"I think I could break away from this fellow inside of a year,"said Hurstwood.  "Nothing will ever come of this arrangement asit's going on now."
　　"I'll look around," said Carrie, observing that the proposedchange seemed to be a serious thing with him.
　　The upshot of this was that the change was eventually effected;not without great gloom on the part of Carrie.  It reallyaffected her more seriously than anything that had yet happened.She began to look upon Hurstwood wholly as a man, and not as alover or husband.  She felt thoroughly bound to him as a wife,and that her lot was cast with his, whatever it might be; but shebegan to see that he was gloomy and taciturn, not a young,strong, and buoyant man.  He looked a little bit old to her aboutthe eyes and mouth now, and there were other things which placedhim in his true rank, so far as her estimation was concerned.She began to feel that she had made a mistake.  Incidentally, shealso began to recall the fact that he had practically forced herto flee with him.
　　The new flat was located in Thirteenth Street, a half block westof Sixth Avenue, and contained only four rooms.  The newneighbourhood did not appeal to Carrie as much.  There were notrees here, no west view of the river.  The street was solidlybuilt up.  There were twelve families here, respectable enough,but nothing like the Vances.  Richer people required more space.
　　Being left alone in this little place, Carrie did without a girl.She made it charming enough, but could not make it delight her.Hurstwood was not inwardly pleased to think that they should haveto modify their state, but he argued that he could do nothing.He must put the best face on it, and let it go at that.
　　He tried to show Carrie that there was no cause for financialalarm, but only congratulation over the chance he would have atthe end of the year by taking her rather more frequently to thetheatre and by providing a liberal table.  This was for the timeonly.  He was getting in the frame of mind where he wantedprincipally to be alone and to be allowed to think.  The diseaseof brooding was beginning to claim him as a victim.  Only thenewspapers and his own thoughts were worth while.  The delight oflove had again slipped away.  It was a case of live, now, makingthe best you can out of a very commonplace station in life.
　　The road downward has but few landings and level places.  Thevery state of his mind, superinduced by his condition, caused thebreach to widen between him and his partner.  At last thatindividual began to wish that Hurstwood was out of it.  It sohappened, however, that a real estate deal on the part of theowner of the land arranged things even more effectually than ill-will could have schemed.
　　"Did you see that?" said Shaughnessy one morning to Hurstwood,pointing to the real estate column in a copy of the "Herald,"which he held.
　　"No, what is it?" said Hurstwood, looking down the items of news.
　　"The man who owns this ground has sold it."
　　"You don't say so?" said Hurstwood.
　　He looked, and there was the notice.  Mr. August Viele hadyesterday registered the transfer of the lot, 25 x 75 feet, atthe corner of Warren and Hudson Streets, to J. F. Slawson for thesum of $57,000.
　　"Our lease expires when?" asked Hurstwood, thinking.  "NextFebruary, isn't it?"
　　"That's right," said Shaughnessy.
　　"It doesn't say what the new man's going to do with it," remarkedHurstwood, looking back to the paper.
　　"We'll hear, I guess, soon enough," said Shaughnessy.
　　Sure enough, it did develop.  Mr. Slawson owned the propertyadjoining, and was going to put up a modern office building.  Thepresent one was to be torn down.  It would take probably a yearand a half to complete the other one.
　　All these things developed by degrees, and Hurstwood began toponder over what would become of the saloon.  One day he spokeabout it to his partner.
　　"Do you think it would be worth while to open up somewhere elsein the neighbourhood?"
　　"What would be the use?" said Shaughnessy.  "We couldn't getanother corner around here."
　　"It wouldn't pay anywhere else, do you think?"
　　"I wouldn't try it," said the other.The approaching change now took on a most serious aspect toHurstwood.  Dissolution meant the loss of his thousand dollars,and he could not save another thousand in the time.  Heunderstood that Shaughnessy was merely tired of the arrangement,and would probably lease the new corner, when completed, alone.He began to worry about the necessity of a new connection and tosee impending serious financial straits unless something turnedup.  This left him in no mood to enjoy his flat or Carrie, andconsequently the depression invaded that quarter.
　　Meanwhile, he took such time as he could to look about, butopportunities were not numerous.  More, he had not the sameimpressive personality which he had when he first came to NewYork.  Bad thoughts had put a shade into his eyes which did notimpress others favourably.  Neither had he thirteen hundreddollars in hand to talk with.  About a month later, finding thathe had not made any progress, Shaughnessy reported definitelythat Slawson would not extend the lease.
　　"I guess this thing's got to come to an end," he said, affectingan air of concern.
　　"Well, if it has, it has," answered Hurstwood, grimly.  He wouldnot give the other a key to his opinions, whatever they were.  Heshould not have the satisfaction.
　　A day or two later he saw that he must say something to Carrie.
　　"You know," he said, "I think I'm going to get the worst of mydeal down there."
　　"How is that?" asked Carrie in astonishment.
　　"Well, the man who owns the ground has sold it.  and the newowner won't release it to us.  The business may come to an end."
　　"Can't you start somewhere else?"
　　"There doesn't seem to be any place.  Shaughnessy doesn't wantto."
　　"Do you lose what you put in?"
　　"Yes," said Hurstwood, whose face was a study.
　　"Oh, isn't that too bad?" said Carrie.
　　"It's a trick," said Hurstwood.  "That's all.  They'll startanother place there all right."
　　Carrie looked at him, and gathered from his whole demeanour whatit meant.  It was serious, very serious.
　　"Do you think you can get something else?" she ventured, timidly.
　　Hurstwood thought a while.  It was all up with the bluff aboutmoney and investment.  She could see now that he was "broke."
　　"I don't know," he said solemnly; "I can try."
　　Chapter XXXIV
　　THE GRIND OF THE MILLSTONES--A SAMPLE OF CHAFF
　　Carrie pondered over this situation as consistently as Hurstwood,once she got the facts adjusted in her mind.  It took severaldays for her to fully realise that the approach of thedissolution of her husband's business meant commonplace struggleand privation.  Her mind went back to her early venture inChicago, the Hansons and their flat, and her heart revolted.That was terrible! Everything about poverty was terrible.  Shewished she knew a way out.  Her recent experiences with theVances had wholly unfitted her to view her own state withcomplacence.  The glamour of the high life of the city had, inthe few experiences afforded her by the former, seized hercompletely.  She had been taught how to dress and where to gowithout having ample means to do either.  Now, these things--ever-present realities as they were--filled her eyes and mind.The more circumscribed became her state, the more entrancingseemed this other.  And now poverty threatened to seize herentirely and to remove this other world far upward like a heavento which any Lazarus might extend, appealingly, his hands.
　　So, too, the ideal brought into her life by Ames remained.  Hehad gone, but here was his word that riches were not everything;that there was a great deal more in the world than she knew; thatthe stage was good, and the literature she read poor.  He was astrong man and clean--how much stronger and better than Hurstwoodand Drouet she only half formulated to herself, but thedifference was painful.  It was something to which shevoluntarily closed her eyes.
　　During the last three months of the Warren Street connection,Hurstwood took parts of days off and hunted, tracking thebusiness advertisements.  It was a more or less depressingbusiness, wholly because of the thought that he must soon getsomething or he would begin to live on the few hundred dollars hewas saving, and then he would have nothing to invest--he wouldhave to hire out as a clerk.
　　Everything he discovered in his line advertised as anopportunity, was either too expensive or too wretched for him.Besides, winter was coming, the papers were announcing hardships,and there was a general feeling of hard times in the air, or, atleast, he thought so.  In his worry, other people's worriesbecame apparent.  No item about a firm failing, a familystarving, or a man dying upon the streets, supposedly ofstarvation, but arrested his eye as he scanned the morningpapers.  Once the "World" came out with a flaring announcementabout "80,000 people out of employment in New York this winter,"which struck as a knife at his heart.
　　"Eighty thousand!" he thought.  "What an awful thing that is."
　　This was new reasoning for Hurstwood.  In the old days the worldhad seemed to be getting along well enough.  He had been wont tosee similar things in the "Daily News," in Chicago, but they didnot hold his attention.  Now, these things were like grey cloudshovering along the horizon of a clear day.  They threatened tocover and obscure his life with chilly greyness.  He tried toshake them off, to forget and brace up.  Sometimes he said tohimself, mentally:
　　"What's the use worrying? I'm not out yet.  I've got six weeksmore.  Even if worst comes to worst, I've got enough to live onfor six months."
　　Curiously, as he troubled over his future, his thoughtsoccasionally reverted to his wife and family.  He had avoidedsuch thoughts for the first three years as much as possible.  Hehated her, and he could get along without her.  Let her go.  Hewould do well enough.  Now, however, when he was not doing wellenough, he began to wonder what she was doing, how his childrenwere getting along.  He could see them living as nicely as ever,occupying the comfortable house and using his property.
　　"By George! it's a shame they should have it all," he vaguelythought to himself on several occasions.  "I didn't do anything."
　　As he looked back now and analysed the situation which led up tohis taking the money, he began mildly to justify himself.  Whathad he done--what in the world--that should bar him out this wayand heap such difficulties upon him? It seemed only yesterday tohim since he was comfortable and well-to-do.  But now it was allwrested from him.
　　"She didn't deserve what she got out of me, that is sure.  Ididn't do so much, if everybody could just know."
　　There was no thought that the facts ought to be advertised.  Itwas only a mental justification he was seeking from himself--something that would enable him to bear his state as a righteousman.
　　One afternoon, five weeks before the Warren Street place closedup, he left the saloon to visit three or four places he sawadvertised in the "Herald." One was down in Gold Street, and hevisited that, but did not enter.  It was such a cheap lookingplace he felt that he could not abide it.  Another was on theBowery, which he knew contained many showy resorts.  It was nearGrand Street, and turned out to be very handsomely fitted up.  Hetalked around about investments for fully three-quarters of anhour with the proprietor, who maintained that his health waspoor, and that was the reason he wished a partner.
　　"Well, now, just how much money would it take to buy a halfinterest here?" said Hurstwood, who saw seven hundred dollars ashis limit.
　　"Three thousand," said the man.
　　Hurstwood's jaw fell.
　　"Cash?" he said.
　　"Cash."
　　He tried to put on an air of deliberation, as one who mightreally buy; but his eyes showed gloom.  He wound up by saying hewould think it over, and came away.  The man he had been talkingto sensed his condition in a vague way.
　　"I don't think he wants to buy," he said to himself.  "He doesn'ttalk right."
　　The afternoon was as grey as lead and cold.  It was blowing up adisagreeable winter wind.  He visited a place far up on the eastside, near Sixty-ninth Street, and it was five o'clock, andgrowing dim, when he reached there.  A portly German kept thisplace.
　　"How about this ad of yours?" asked Hurstwood, who ratherobjected to the looks of the place.
　　"Oh, dat iss all over," said the German.  "I vill not sell now."
　　"Oh, is that so?"
　　"Yes; dere is nothing to dat.  It iss all over."
　　"Very well," said Hurstwood, turning around.
　　The German paid no more attention to him, and it made him angry.
　　"The crazy ass!" he said to himself.  "What does he want toadvertise for?"
　　Wholly depressed, he started for Thirteenth Street.  The flat hadonly a light in the kitchen, where Carrie was working.  He strucka match and, lighting the gas, sat down in the dining-roomwithout even greeting her.  She came to the door and looked in.
　　"It's you, is it?" she said, and went back.
　　"Yes," he said, without even looking up from the evening paper hehad bought.
　　Carrie saw things were wrong with him.  He was not so handsomewhen gloomy.  The lines at the sides of the eyes were deepened.Naturally dark of skin, gloom made him look slightly sinister.He was quite a disagreeable figure.
　　Carrie set the table and brought in the meal.
　　"Dinner's ready," she said, passing him for something.
　　He did not answer, reading on.
　　She came in and sat down at her place, feeling exceedinglywretched.
　　"Won't you eat now?" she asked.
　　He folded his paper and drew near, silence holding for a time,except for the "Pass me's."
　　"It's been gloomy to-day, hasn't it?" ventured Carrie, after atime.
　　"Yes," he said.
　　He only picked at his food.
　　"Are you still sure to close up?" said Carrie, venturing to takeup the subject which they had discussed often enough.
　　"Of course we are," he said, with the slightest modification ofsharpness.
　　This retort angered Carrie.  She had had a dreary day of itherself.
　　"You needn't talk like that," she said.
　　"Oh!" he exclaimed, pushing back from the table, as if to saymore, but letting it go at that.  Then he picked up his paper.Carrie left her seat, containing herself with difficulty.  He sawshe was hurt.
　　"Don't go 'way," he said, as she started back into the kitchen."Eat your dinner."
　　She passed, not answering.
　　He looked at the paper a few moments, and then rose up and put onhis coat.
　　"I'm going downtown, Carrie," he said, coming out.  "I'm out ofsorts to-night."
　　She did not answer.
　　"Don't be angry," he said.  "It will be all right to morrow."
　　He looked at her, but she paid no attention to him, working ather dishes.
　　"Good-bye!" he said finally, and went out.
　　This was the first strong result of the situation between them,but with the nearing of the last day of the business the gloombecame almost a permanent thing.  Hurstwood could not conceal hisfeelings about the matter.  Carrie could not help wondering whereshe was drifting.  It got so that they talked even less thanusual, and yet it was not Hurstwood who felt any objection toCarrie.  It was Carrie who shied away from him.  This he noticed.It aroused an objection to her becoming indifferent to him.  Hemade the possibility of friendly intercourse almost a giant task,and then noticed with discontent that Carrie added to it by hermanner and made it more impossible.
　　At last the final day came.  When it actually arrived, Hurstwood,who had got his mind into such a state where a thunderclap andraging storm would have seemed highly appropriate, was ratherrelieved to find that it was a plain, ordinary day.  The sunshone, the temperature was pleasant.  He felt, as he came to thebreakfast table, that it wasn't so terrible, after all.
　　"Well," he said to Carrie, "to-day's my last day on earth."
　　Carrie smiled in answer to his humour.
　　Hurstwood glanced over his paper rather gayly.  He seemed to havelost a load.
　　"I'll go down for a little while," he said after breakfast, "andthen I'll look around.  To-morrow I'll spend the whole daylooking about.  I think I can get something, now this thing's offmy hands."
　　He went out smiling and visited the place.  Shaughnessy wasthere.  They had made all arrangements to share according totheir interests.  When, however, he had been there several hours,gone out three more, and returned, his elation had departed.  Asmuch as he had objected to the place, now that it was no longerto exist, he felt sorry.  He wished that things were different.
　　Shaughnessy was coolly businesslike.
　　"Well," he said at five o'clock, "we might as well count thechange and divide."
　　They did so.  The fixtures had already been sold and the sumdivided.
　　"Good-night," said Hurstwood at the final moment, in a lasteffort to be genial.
　　"So long," said Shaughnessy, scarcely deigning a notice.
　　Thus the Warren Street arrangement was permanently concluded.
　　Carrie had prepared a good dinner at the flat, but after his rideup, Hurstwood was in a solemn and reflective mood.
　　"Well?" said Carrie, inquisitively.
　　"I'm out of that," he answered, taking off his coat.
　　As she looked at him, she wondered what his financial state wasnow.  They ate and talked a little.
　　"Will you have enough to buy in anywhere else?" asked Carrie.
　　"No," he said.  "I'll have to get something else and save up."
　　"It would be nice if you could get some place," said Carrie,prompted by anxiety and hope.
　　"I guess I will," he said reflectively.
　　For some days thereafter he put on his overcoat regularly in themorning and sallied forth.  On these ventures he first consoledhimself with the thought that with the seven hundred dollars hehad he could still make some advantageous arrangement.  Hethought about going to some brewery, which, as he knew,frequently controlled saloons which they leased, and get them tohelp him.  Then he remembered that he would have to pay outseveral hundred any way for fixtures and that he would havenothing left for his monthly expenses.  It was costing him nearlyeighty dollars a month to live.
　　"No," he said, in his sanest moments, "I can't do it.  I'll getsomething else and save up."
　　This getting-something proposition complicated itself the momenthe began to think of what it was he wanted to do.  Manage aplace? Where should he get such a position? The papers containedno requests for managers.  Such positions, he knew well enough,were either secured by long years of service or were bought witha half or third interest.  Into a place important enough to needsuch a manager he had not money enough to buy.
　　Nevertheless, he started out.  His clothes were very good and hisappearance still excellent, but it involved the trouble ofdeluding.  People, looking at him, imagined instantly that a manof his age, stout and well dressed, must be well off.  Heappeared a comfortable owner of something, a man from whom thecommon run of mortals could well expect gratuities.  Being nowforty-three years of age, and comfortably built, walking was noteasy.  He had not been used to exercise for many years.  His legstired, his shoulders ached, and his feet pained him at the closeof the day, even when he took street cars in almost everydirection.  The mere getting up and down, if long continued,produced this result.
　　The fact that people took him to be better off than he was, hewell understood.  It was so painfully clear to him that itretarded his search.  Not that he wished to be less well-appearing, but that he was ashamed to belie his appearance byincongruous appeals.  So he hesitated, wondering what to do.
　　He thought of the hotels, but instantly he remembered that he hadhad no experience as a clerk, and, what was more important, noacquaintances or friends in that line to whom he could go.  Hedid know some hotel owners in several cities, including New York,but they knew of his dealings with Fitzgerald and Moy.  He couldnot apply to them.  He thought of other lines suggested by largebuildings or businesses which he knew of--wholesale groceries,hardware, insurance concerns, and the like--but he had had noexperience.
　　How to go about getting anything was a bitter thought.  Would hehave to go personally and ask; wait outside an office door, and,then, distinguished and affluent looking, announce that he waslooking for something to do? He strained painfully at thethought.  No, he could not do that.
　　He really strolled about, thinking, and then, the weather beingcold, stepped into a hotel.  He knew hotels well enough to knowthat any decent individual was welcome to a chair in the lobby.This was in the Broadway Central, which was then one of the mostimportant hotels in the city.  Taking a chair here was a painfulthing to him.  To think he should come to this! He had heardloungers about hotels called chairwarmers.  He had called themthat himself in his day.  But here he was, despite thepossibility of meeting some one who knew him, shielding himselffrom cold and the weariness of the streets in a hotel lobby.
　　"I can't do this way," he said to himself.  "There's no use of mystarting out mornings without first thinking up some place to go.I'll think of some places and then look them up."
　　It occurred to him that the positions of bartenders weresometimes open, but he put this out of his mind.  Bartender--he,the ex-manager!
　　It grew awfully dull sitting in the hotel lobby, and so at fourhe went home.  He tried to put on a business air as he went in,but it was a feeble imitation.  The rocking chair in the dining-room was comfortable.  He sank into it gladly, with severalpapers he had bought, and began to read.
　　As she was going through the room to begin preparing dinner,Carrie said:
　　"The man was here for the rent to-day."
　　"Oh, was he?" said Hurstwood.
　　The least wrinkle crept into his brow as he remembered that thiswas February 2d, the time the man always called.  He fished downin his pocket for his purse, getting the first taste of payingout when nothing is coming in.  He looked at the fat, green rollas a sick man looks at the one possible saving cure.  Then hecounted off twenty-eight dollars.
　　"Here you are," he said to Carrie, when she came through again.
　　He buried himself in his papers and read.  Oh, the rest of it--the relief from walking and thinking! What Lethean waters werethese floods of telegraphed intelligence! He forgot his troubles,in part.  Here was a young, handsome woman, if you might believethe newspaper drawing, suing a rich, fat, candy-making husband inBrooklyn for divorce.  Here was another item detailing thewrecking of a vessel in ice and snow off Prince's Bay on StatenIsland.  A long, bright column told of the doings in thetheatrical world--the plays produced, the actors appearing, themanagers making announcements.  Fannie Davenport was just openingat the Fifth Avenue.  Daly was producing "King Lear." He read ofthe early departure for the season of a party composed of theVanderbilts and their friends for Florida.  An interestingshooting affray was on in the mountains of Kentucky.  So he read,read, read, rocking in the warm room near the radiator andwaiting for dinner to be served.
　　Chapter XXXV
　　THE PASSING OF EFFORT--THE VISAGE OF CARE
　　The next morning he looked over the papers and waded through along list of advertisements, making a few notes.  Then he turnedto the male-help-wanted column, but with disagreeable feelings.The day was before him--a long day in which to discoversomething--and this was how he must begin to discover.  Hescanned the long column, which mostly concerned bakers,bushelmen, cooks, compositors, drivers, and the like, finding twothings only which arrested his eye.  One was a cashier wanted ina wholesale furniture house, and the other a salesman for awhiskey house.  He had never thought of the latter.  At once hedecided to look that up.
　　The firm in question was Alsbery & Co., whiskey brokers.
　　He was admitted almost at once to the manager on his appearance.
　　"Good-morning, sir," said the latter, thinking at first that hewas encountering one of his out-of-town customers.
　　"Good-morning," said Hurstwood.  "You advertised, I believe, fora salesman?"
　　"Oh," said the man, showing plainly the enlightenment which hadcome to him.  "Yes.  Yes, I did."
　　"I thought I'd drop in," said Hurstwood, with dignity.  "I've hadsome experience in that line myself."
　　"Oh, have you?" said the man.  "What experience have you had?"
　　"Well, I've managed several liquor houses in my time.  Recently Iowned a third-interest in a saloon at Warren and Hudson streets."
　　"I see," said the man.
　　Hurstwood ceased, waiting for some suggestion.
　　"We did want a salesman," said the man.  "I don't know as it'sanything you'd care to take hold of, though."
　　"I see," said Hurstwood.  "Well, I'm in no position to choose,just at present.  If it were open, I should be glad to get it."
　　The man did not take kindly at all to his "No position tochoose." He wanted some one who wasn't thinking of a choice orsomething better.  Especially not an old man.  He wanted some oneyoung, active, and glad to work actively for a moderate sum.Hurstwood did not please him at all.  He had more of an air thanhis employers.
　　"Well," he said in answer, "we'd be glad to consider yourapplication.  We shan't decide for a few days yet.  Suppose yousend us your references."
　　"I will," said Hurstwood.
　　He nodded good-morning and came away.  At the corner he looked atthe furniture company's address, and saw that it was in WestTwenty-third Street.  Accordingly, he went up there.  The placewas not large enough, however.  It looked moderate, the men in itidle and small salaried.  He walked by, glancing in, and thendecided not to go in there.
　　"They want a girl, probably, at ten a week," he said.
　　At one o'clock he thought of eating, and went to a restaurant inMadison Square.  There he pondered over places which he mightlook up.  He was tired.  It was blowing up grey again.  Acrossthe way, through Madison Square Park, stood the great hotels,looking down upon a busy scene.  He decided to go over to thelobby of one and sit a while.  It was warm in there and bright.He had seen no one he knew at the Broadway Central.  In alllikelihood he would encounter no one here.  Finding a seat on oneof the red plush divans close to the great windows which look outon Broadway's busy rout, he sat musing.  His state did not seemso bad in here.  Sitting still and looking out, he could takesome slight consolation in the few hundred dollars he had in hispurse.  He could forget, in a measure, the weariness of thestreet and his tiresome searches.  Still, it was only escape froma severe to a less severe state.  He was still gloomy anddisheartened.  There, minutes seemed to go very slowly.  An hourwas a long, long time in passing.  It was filled for him withobservations and mental comments concerning the actual guests ofthe hotel, who passed in and out, and those more prosperouspedestrians whose good fortune showed in their clothes andspirits as they passed along Broadway, outside.  It was nearlythe first time since he had arrived in the city that his leisureafforded him ample opportunity to contemplate this spectacle.Now, being, perforce, idle himself, he wondered at the activityof others.  How gay were the youths he saw, how pretty the women.Such fine clothes they all wore.  They were so intent upongetting somewhere.  He saw coquettish glances cast by magnificentgirls.  Ah, the money it required to train with such--how well heknew! How long it had been since he had had the opportunity to doso!
　　The clock outside registered four.  It was a little early, but hethought he would go back to the flat.
　　This going back to the flat was coupled with the thought thatCarrie would think he was sitting around too much if he came homeearly.  He hoped he wouldn't have to, but the day hung heavily onhis hands.  Over there he was on his own ground.  He could sit inhis rocking-chair and read.  This busy, distracting, suggestivescene was shut out.  He could read his papers.  Accordingly, hewent home.  Carrie was reading, quite alone.  It was rather darkin the flat, shut in as it was.
　　"You'll hurt your eyes," he said when he saw her.
　　After taking off his coat, he felt it incumbent upon him to makesome little report of his day.
　　"I've been talking with a wholesale liquor company," he said.  "Imay go on the road."
　　"Wouldn't that be nice!" said Carrie."It wouldn't be such a bad thing," he answered.
　　Always from the man at the corner now he bought two papers--the"Evening World" and "Evening Sun." So now he merely picked hispapers up, as he came by, without stopping.
　　He drew up his chair near the radiator and lighted the gas.  Thenit was as the evening before.  His difficulties vanished in theitems he so well loved to read.
　　The next day was even worse than the one before, because now hecould not think of where to go.  Nothing he saw in the papers hestudied--till ten o'clock--appealed to him.  He felt that heought to go out, and yet he sickened at the thought.  Where to,where to?
　　"You mustn't forget to leave me my money for this week," saidCarrie, quietly.
　　They had an arrangement by which he placed twelve dollars a weekin her hands, out of which to pay current expenses.  He heaved alittle sigh as she said this, and drew out his purse.  Again hefelt the dread of the thing.  Here he was taking off, taking off,and nothing coming in.
　　"Lord!" he said, in his own thoughts, "this can't go on."
　　To Carrie he said nothing whatsoever.  She could feel that herrequest disturbed him.  To pay her would soon become adistressing thing.
　　"Yet, what have I got to do with it?" she thought.  "Oh, whyshould I be made to worry?"
　　Hurstwood went out and made for Broadway.  He wanted to think upsome place.  Before long, though, he reached the Grand Hotel atThirty-first Street.  He knew of its comfortable lobby.  He wascold after his twenty blocks' walk.
　　"I'll go in their barber shop and get a shave," he thought.
　　Thus he justified himself in sitting down in here after histonsorial treatment.
　　Again, time hanging heavily on his hands, he went home early, andthis continued for several days, each day the need to huntpaining him, and each day disgust, depression, shamefacednessdriving him into lobby idleness.
　　At last three days came in which a storm prevailed, and he didnot go out at all.  The snow began to fall late one afternoon.It was a regular flurry of large, soft, white flakes.  In themorning it was still coming down with a high wind, and the papersannounced a blizzard.  From out the front windows one could see adeep, soft bedding.
　　"I guess I'll not try to go out to-day," he said to Carrie atbreakfast.  "It's going to be awful bad, so the papers say."
　　"The man hasn't brought my coal, either," said Carrie, whoordered by the bushel.
　　"I'll go over and see about it," said Hurstwood.  This was thefirst time he had ever suggested doing an errand, but, somehow,the wish to sit about the house prompted it as a sort ofcompensation for the privilege.
　　All day and all night it snowed, and the city began to sufferfrom a general blockade of traffic.  Great attention was given tothe details of the storm by the newspapers, which played up thedistress of the poor in large type.
　　Hurstwood sat and read by his radiator in the corner.  He did nottry to think about his need of work.  This storm being soterrific, and tying up all things, robbed him of the need.  Hemade himself wholly comfortable and toasted his feet.
　　Carrie observed his ease with some misgiving.  For all the furyof the storm she doubted his comfort.  He took his situation toophilosophically.
　　Hurstwood, however, read on and on.  He did not pay muchattention to Carrie.  She fulfilled her household duties and saidlittle to disturb him.
　　The next day it was still snowing, and the next, bitter cold.Hurstwood took the alarm of the paper and sat still.  Now hevolunteered to do a few other little things.  One was to go tothe butcher, another to the grocery.  He really thought nothingof these little services in connection with their truesignificance.  He felt as if he were not wholly useless--indeed,in such a stress of weather, quite worth while about the house.
　　On the fourth day, however, it cleared, and he read that thestorm was over.  Now, however, he idled, thinking how sloppy thestreets would be.
　　It was noon before he finally abandoned his papers and got underway.  Owing to the slightly warmer temperature the streets werebad.  He went across Fourteenth Street on the car and got atransfer south on Broadway.  One little advertisement he had,relating to a saloon down in Pearl Street.  When he reached theBroadway Central, however, he changed his mind.
　　"What's the use?" he thought, looking out upon the slop and snow."I couldn't buy into it.  It's a thousand to one nothing comes ofit.  I guess I'll get off," and off he got.  In the lobby he tooka seat and waited again, wondering what he could do.
　　While he was idly pondering, satisfied to be inside, a well-dressed man passed up the lobby, stopped, looked sharply, as ifnot sure of his memory, and then approached.  Hurstwoodrecognised Cargill, the owner of the large stables in Chicago ofthe same name, whom he had last seen at Avery Hall, the nightCarrie appeared there.  The remembrance of how this individualbrought up his wife to shake hands on that occasion was also onthe instant clear.
　　Hurstwood was greatly abashed.  His eyes expressed the difficultyhe felt.
　　"Why, it's Hurstwood!" said Cargill, remembering now, and sorrythat he had not recognised him quickly enough in the beginning tohave avoided this meeting.
　　"Yes," said Hurstwood.  "How are you?"
　　"Very well," said Cargill, troubled for something to talk about."Stopping here?"
　　"No," said Hurstwood, "just keeping an appointment.""I knew you had left Chicago.  I was wondering what had become ofyou."
　　"Oh, I'm here now," answered Hurstwood, anxious to get away.
　　"Doing well, I suppose?"
　　"Excellent."
　　"Glad to hear it."
　　They looked at one another, rather embarrassed.
　　"Well, I have an engagement with a friend upstairs.  I'll leaveyou.  So long."
　　Hurstwood nodded his head.
　　"Damn it all," he murmured, turning toward the door.  "I knewthat would happen."
　　He walked several blocks up the street.  His watch onlyregistered 1.30.  He tried to think of some place to go orsomething to do.  The day was so bad he wanted only to be inside.Finally his feet began to feel wet and cold, and he boarded acar.  This took him to Fifty-ninth Street, which was as good asanywhere else.  Landed here, he turned to walk back along SeventhAvenue, but the slush was too much.  The misery of lounging aboutwith nowhere to go became intolerable.  He felt as if he werecatching cold.
　　Stopping at a corner, he waited for a car south bound.  This wasno day to be out; he would go home.
　　Carrie was surprised to see him at a quarter of three.
　　"It's a miserable day out," was all he said.  Then he took offhis coat and changed his shoes.
　　That night he felt a cold coming on and took quinine.  He wasfeverish until morning, and sat about the next day while Carriewaited on him.  He was a helpless creature in sickness, not veryhandsome in a dull-coloured bath gown and his hair uncombed.  Helooked haggard about the eyes and quite old.  Carrie noticedthis, and it did not appeal to her.  She wanted to be good-natured and sympathetic, but something about the man held heraloof.
　　Toward evening he looked so badly in the weak light that shesuggested he go to bed.
　　"You'd better sleep alone," she said, "you'll feel better.  I'llopen your bed for you now."
　　"All right," he said.
　　As she did all these things, she was in a most despondent state.
　　"What a life! What a life!" was her one thought.
　　Once during the day, when he sat near the radiator, hunched upand reading, she passed through, and seeing him, wrinkled herbrows.  In the front room, where it was not so warm, she sat bythe window and cried.  This was the life cut out for her, was it?To live cooped up in a small flat with some one who was out ofwork, idle, and indifferent to her.  She was merely a servant tohim now, nothing more.
　　This crying made her eyes red, and when, in preparing his bed,she lighted the gas, and, having prepared it, called him in, henoticed the fact.
　　"What's the matter with you?" he asked, looking into her face.His voice was hoarse and his unkempt head only added to itsgrewsome quality.
　　"Nothing," said Carrie, weakly.
　　"You've been crying," he said.
　　"I haven't, either," she answered.
　　It was not for love of him, that he knew.
　　"You needn't cry," he said, getting into bed.  "Things will comeout all right."
　　In a day or two he was up again, but rough weather holding, hestayed in.  The Italian newsdealer now delivered the morningpapers, and these he read assiduously.  A few times after that heventured out, but meeting another of his old-time friends, hebegan to feel uneasy sitting about hotel corridors.
　　Every day he came home early, and at last made no pretence ofgoing anywhere.  Winter was no time to look for anything.
　　Naturally, being about the house, he noticed the way Carrie didthings.  She was far from perfect in household methods andeconomy, and her little deviations on this score first caught hiseye.  Not, however, before her regular demand for her allowancebecame a grievous thing.  Sitting around as he did, the weeksseemed to pass very quickly.  Every Tuesday Carrie asked for hermoney.
　　"Do you think we live as cheaply as we might?" he asked oneTuesday morning.
　　"I do the best I can," said Carrie.
　　Nothing was added to this at the moment, but the next day hesaid:
　　"Do you ever go to the Gansevoort Market over here?"
　　"I didn't know there was such a market," said Carrie.
　　"They say you can get things lots cheaper there."
　　Carrie was very indifferent to the suggestion.  These were thingswhich she did not like at all.
　　"How much do you pay for a pound of meat?" he asked one day.
　　"Oh, there are different prices," said Carrie.  "Sirloin steak istwenty-two cents."
　　"That's steep, isn't it?" he answered.
　　So he asked about other things, until finally, with the passingdays, it seemed to become a mania with him.  He learned theprices and remembered them.His errand-running capacity also improved.  It began in a smallway, of course.  Carrie, going to get her hat one morning, wasstopped by him.
　　"Where are you going, Carrie?" he asked.
　　"Over to the baker's," she answered.
　　"I'd just as leave go for you," he said.
　　She acquiesced, and he went.  Each afternoon he would go to thecorner for the papers.
　　"Is there anything you want?" he would say.
　　By degrees she began to use him.  Doing this, however, she lostthe weekly payment of twelve dollars.
　　"You want to pay me to-day," she said one Tuesday, about thistime.
　　"How much?" he asked.
　　She understood well enough what it meant.
　　"Well, about five dollars," she answered.  "I owe the coal man."
　　The same day he said:
　　"I think this Italian up here on the corner sells coal at twenty-five cents a bushel.  I'll trade with him."
　　Carrie heard this with indifference.
　　"All right," she said.
　　Then it came to be:
　　"George, I must have some coal to-day," or, "You must get somemeat of some kind for dinner."
　　He would find out what she needed and order.
　　Accompanying this plan came skimpiness.
　　"I only got a half-pound of steak," he said, coming in oneafternoon with his papers.  "We never seem to eat very much."
　　These miserable details ate the heart out of Carrie.  Theyblackened her days and grieved her soul.  Oh, how this man hadchanged!  All day and all day, here he sat, reading his papers.The world seemed to have no attraction.  Once in a while he wouldgo out, in fine weather, it might be four or five hours, betweeneleven and four.  She could do nothing but view him with gnawingcontempt.
　　It was apathy with Hurstwood, resulting from his inability to seehis way out.  Each month drew from his small store.  Now, he hadonly five hundred dollars left, and this he hugged, half feelingas if he could stave off absolute necessity for an indefiniteperiod.  Sitting around the house, he decided to wear some oldclothes he had.  This came first with the bad days.  Only once heapologised in the very beginning:
　　"It's so bad to-day, I'll just wear these around."Eventually these became the permanent thing.
　　Also, he had been wont to pay fifteen cents for a shave, and atip of ten cents.  In his first distress, he cut down the tip tofive, then to nothing.  Later, he tried a ten-cent barber shop,and, finding that the shave was satisfactory, patronisedregularly.  Later still, he put off shaving to every other day,then to every third, and so on, until once a week became therule.  On Saturday he was a sight to see.
　　Of course, as his own self-respect vanished, it perished for himin Carrie.  She could not understand what had gotten into theman.  He had some money, he had a decent suit remaining, he wasnot bad looking when dressed up.  She did not forget her owndifficult struggle in Chicago, but she did not forget either thatshe had never ceased trying.  He never tried.  He did not evenconsult the ads in the papers any more.
　　Finally, a distinct impression escaped from her.
　　"What makes you put so much butter on the steak?" he asked herone evening, standing around in the kitchen.
　　"To make it good, of course," she answered.
　　"Butter is awful dear these days," he suggested.
　　"You wouldn't mind it if you were working," she answered.
　　He shut up after this, and went in to his paper, but the retortrankled in his mind.  It was the first cutting remark that hadcome from her.
　　That same evening, Carrie, after reading, went off to the frontroom to bed.  This was unusual.  When Hurstwood decided to go, heretired, as usual, without a light.  It was then that hediscovered Carrie's absence.
　　"That's funny," he said; "maybe she's sitting up."
　　He gave the matter no more thought, but slept.  In the morningshe was not beside him.  Strange to say, this passed withoutcomment.
　　Night approaching, and a slightly more conversational feelingprevailing, Carrie said:
　　"I think I'll sleep alone to-night.  I have a headache."
　　"All right," said Hurstwood.
　　The third night she went to her front bed without apologies.
　　This was a grim blow to Hurstwood, but he never mentioned it.
　　"All right," he said to himself, with an irrepressible frown,"let her sleep alone."
　　Chapter XXXVI
　　A GRIM RETROGRESSION--THE PHANTOM OF CHANCE
　　The Vances, who had been back in the city ever since Christmas,had not forgotten Carrie; but they, or rather Mrs. Vance, hadnever called on her, for the very simple reason that Carrie hadnever sent her address.  True to her nature, she correspondedwith Mrs. Vance as long as she still lived in Seventy-eighthStreet, but when she was compelled to move into Thirteenth, herfear that the latter would take it as an indication of reducedcircumstances caused her to study some way of avoiding thenecessity of giving her address.  Not finding any convenientmethod, she sorrowfully resigned the privilege of writing to herfriend entirely.  The latter wondered at this strange silence,thought Carrie must have left the city, and in the end gave herup as lost.  So she was thoroughly surprised to encounter her inFourteenth Street, where she had gone shopping.  Carrie was therefor the same purpose.
　　"Why, Mrs. Wheeler," said Mrs. Vance, looking Carrie over in aglance, "where have you been? Why haven't you been to see me?I've been wondering all this time what had become of you.Really, I----"
　　"I'm so glad to see you," said Carrie, pleased and yetnonplussed.  Of all times, this was the worst to encounter Mrs.Vance.  "Why, I'm living down town here.  I've been intending tocome and see you.  Where are you living now?"
　　"In Fifty-eighth Street," said Mrs. Vance, "just off SeventhAvenue--218.  Why don't you come and see me?"
　　"I will," said Carrie.  "Really, I've been wanting to come.  Iknow I ought to.  It's a shame.  But you know----"
　　"What's your number?" said Mrs. Vance.
　　"Thirteenth Street," said Carrie, reluctantly.  "112 West."
　　"Oh," said Mrs. Vance, "that's right near here, isn't it?"
　　"Yes," said Carrie.  "You must come down and see me some time."
　　"Well, you're a fine one," said Mrs. Vance, laughing, the whilenoting that Carrie's appearance had modified somewhat.  "Theaddress, too," she added to herself.  "They must be hard up."
　　Still she liked Carrie well enough to take her in tow.
　　"Come with me in here a minute," she exclaimed, turning into astore.
　　When Carrie returned home, there was Hurstwood, reading as usual.He seemed to take his condition with the utmost nonchalance.  Hisbeard was at least four days old.
　　"Oh," thought Carrie, "if she were to come here and see him?"
　　She shook her head in absolute misery.  It looked as if hersituation was becoming unbearable.
　　Driven to desperation, she asked at dinner:
　　"Did you ever hear any more from that wholesale house?"
　　"No," he said.  "They don't want an inexperienced man."
　　Carrie dropped the subject, feeling unable to say more.
　　"I met Mrs. Vance this afternoon," she said, after a time.
　　"Did, eh?" he answered.
　　"They're back in New York now," Carrie went on.  "She did look sonice."
　　"Well, she can afford it as long as he puts up for it," returnedHurstwood.  "He's got a soft job."
　　Hurstwood was looking into the paper.  He could not see the lookof infinite weariness and discontent Carrie gave him.
　　"She said she thought she'd call here some day."
　　"She's been long getting round to it, hasn't she?" saidHurstwood, with a kind of sarcasm.
　　The woman didn't appeal to him from her spending side.
　　"Oh, I don't know," said Carrie, angered by the man's attitude."Perhaps I didn't want her to come."
　　"She's too gay," said Hurstwood, significantly.  "No one can keepup with her pace unless they've got a lot of money."
　　"Mr. Vance doesn't seem to find it very hard."
　　"He may not now," answered Hurstwood, doggedly, wellunderstanding the inference; "but his life isn't done yet.  Youcan't tell what'll happen.  He may get down like anybody else."
　　There was something quite knavish in the man's attitude.  His eyeseemed to be cocked with a twinkle upon the fortunate, expectingtheir defeat.  His own state seemed a thing apart--notconsidered.
　　This thing was the remains of his old-time cocksureness andindependence.  Sitting in his flat, and reading of the doings ofother people, sometimes this independent, undefeated mood cameupon him.  Forgetting the weariness of the streets and thedegradation of search, he would sometimes prick up his ears.  Itwas as if he said:
　　"I can do something.  I'm not down yet.  There's a lot of thingscoming to me if I want to go after them."
　　It was in this mood that he would occasionally dress up, go for ashave, and, putting on his gloves, sally forth quite actively.Not with any definite aim.  It was more a barometric condition.He felt just right for being outside and doing something.
　　On such occasions, his money went also.  He knew of several pokerrooms down town.  A few acquaintances he had in downtown resortsand about the City Hall.  It was a change to see them andexchange a few friendly commonplaces.
　　He had once been accustomed to hold a pretty fair hand at poker.Many a friendly game had netted him a hundred dollars or more atthe time when that sum was merely sauce to the dish of the game--not the all in all.  Now, he thought of playing.
　　"I might win a couple of hundred.  I'm not out of practice."
　　It is but fair to say that this thought had occurred to himseveral times before he acted upon it.The poker room which he first invaded was over a saloon in WestStreet, near one of the ferries.  He had been there before.Several games were going.  These he watched for a time andnoticed that the pots were quite large for the ante involved.
　　"Deal me a hand," he said at the beginning of a new shuffle.  Hepulled up a chair and studied his cards.  Those playing made thatquiet study of him which is so unapparent, and yet invariably sosearching.
　　Poor fortune was with him at first.  He received a mixedcollection without progression or pairs.  The pot was opened.
　　"I pass," he said.
　　On the strength of this, he was content to lose his ante.  Thedeals did fairly by him in the long run, causing him to come awaywith a few dollars to the good.
　　The next afternoon he was back again, seeking amusement andprofit.  This time he followed up three of a kind to his doom.There was a better hand across the table, held by a pugnaciousIrish youth, who was a political hanger-on of the Tammanydistrict in which they were located.  Hurstwood was surprised atthe persistence of this individual, whose bets came with a sang-froid which, if a bluff, was excellent art.  Hurstwood began todoubt, but kept, or thought to keep, at least, the cool demeanourwith which, in olden times, he deceived those psychic students ofthe gaming table, who seem to read thoughts and moods, ratherthan exterior evidences, however subtle.  He could not down thecowardly thought that this man had something better and wouldstay to the end, drawing his last dollar into the pot, should hechoose to go so far.  Still, he hoped to win much--his hand wasexcellent.  Why not raise it five more?
　　"I raise you three," said the youth.
　　"Make it five," said Hurstwood, pushing out his chips.
　　"Come again," said the youth, pushing out a small pile of reds.
　　"Let me have some more chips," said Hurstwood to the keeper incharge, taking out a bill.
　　A cynical grin lit up the face of his youthful opponent.  Whenthe chips were laid out, Hurstwood met the raise.
　　"Five again," said the youth.
　　Hurstwood's brow was wet.  He was deep in now--very deep for him.Sixty dollars of his good money was up.  He was ordinarily nocoward, but the thought of losing so much weakened him.  Finallyhe gave way.  He would not trust to this fine hand any longer.
　　"I call," he said.
　　"A full house!" said the youth, spreading out his cards.
　　Hurstwood's hand dropped.
　　"I thought I had you," he said, weakly.
　　The youth raked in his chips, and Hurstwood came away, notwithout first stopping to count his remaining cash on the stair.
　　"Three hundred and forty dollars," he said.
　　With this loss and ordinary expenses, so much had already gone.
　　Back in the flat, he decided he would play no more.
　　Remembering Mrs. Vance's promise to call, Carrie made one othermild protest.  It was concerning Hurstwood's appearance.  Thisvery day, coming home, he changed his clothes to the old togs hesat around in.
　　"What makes you always put on those old clothes?" asked Carrie.
　　"What's the use wearing my good ones around here?" he asked.
　　"Well, I should think you'd feel better." Then she added: "Someone might call."
　　"Who?" he said.
　　"Well, Mrs. Vance," said Carrie.
　　"She needn't see me," he answered, sullenly.
　　This lack of pride and interest made Carrie almost hate him.
　　"Oh," she thought, "there he sits.  'She needn't see me.' Ishould think he would be ashamed of himself."
　　The real bitterness of this thing was added when Mrs. Vance didcall.  It was on one of her shopping rounds.  Making her way upthe commonplace hall, she knocked at Carrie's door.  To hersubsequent and agonising distress, Carrie was out.  Hurstwoodopened the door, half-thinking that the knock was Carrie's.  Foronce, he was taken honestly aback.  The lost voice of youth andpride spoke in him.
　　"Why," he said, actually stammering, "how do you do?"
　　"How do you do?" said Mrs. Vance, who could scarcely believe hereyes.  His great confusion she instantly perceived.  He did notknow whether to invite her in or not.
　　"Is your wife at home?" she inquired.
　　"No," he said, "Carrie's out; but won't you step in? She'll beback shortly."
　　"No-o," said Mrs. Vance, realising the change of it all.  "I'mreally very much in a hurry.  I thought I'd just run up and lookin, but I couldn't stay.  Just tell your wife she must come andsee me."
　　"I will," said Hurstwood, standing back, and feeling intenserelief at her going.  He was so ashamed that he folded his handsweakly, as he sat in the chair afterwards, and thought.
　　Carrie, coming in from another direction, thought she saw Mrs.Vance going away.  She strained her eyes, but could not makesure.
　　"Was anybody here just now?" she asked of Hurstwood.
　　"Yes," he said guiltily; "Mrs. Vance."
　　"Did she see you?" she asked, expressing her full despair.This cut Hurstwood like a whip, and made him sullen.
　　"If she had eyes, she did.  I opened the door."
　　"Oh," said Carrie, closing one hand tightly out of sheernervousness.  "What did she have to say?"
　　"Nothing," he answered.  "She couldn't stay."
　　"And you looking like that!" said Carrie, throwing aside a longreserve.
　　"What of it?" he said, angering.  "I didn't know she was coming,did I?"
　　"You knew she might," said Carrie.  "I told you she said she wascoming.  I've asked you a dozen times to wear your other clothes.Oh, I think this is just terrible."
　　"Oh, let up," he answered.  "What difference does it make? Youcouldn't associate with her, anyway.  They've got too much money.
　　"Who said I wanted to?" said Carrie, fiercely.
　　"Well, you act like it, rowing around over my looks.  You'd thinkI'd committed----"
　　Carrie interrupted:
　　"It's true," she said.  "I couldn't if I wanted to, but whosefault is it? You're very free to sit and talk about who I couldassociate with.  Why don't you get out and look for work?"
　　This was a thunderbolt in camp.
　　"What's it to you?" he said, rising, almost fiercely.  "I pay therent, don't I? I furnish the----"
　　"Yes, you pay the rent," said Carrie.  "You talk as if there wasnothing else in the world but a flat to sit around in.  Youhaven't done a thing for three months except sit around andinterfere here.  I'd like to know what you married me for?"
　　"I didn't marry you," he said, in a snarling tone.
　　"I'd like to know what you did, then, in Montreal?" she answered.
　　"Well, I didn't marry you," he answered.  "You can get that outof your head.  You talk as though you didn't know."
　　Carrie looked at him a moment, her eyes distending.  She hadbelieved it was all legal and binding enough.
　　"What did you lie to me for, then?" she asked, fiercely.  "Whatdid you force me to run away with you for?"
　　Her voice became almost a sob.
　　"Force!" he said, with curled lip.  "A lot of forcing I did."
　　"Oh!" said Carrie, breaking under the strain, and turning.  "Oh,oh!" and she hurried into the front room.
　　Hurstwood was now hot and waked up.  It was a great shaking upfor him, both mental and moral.  He wiped his brow as he lookedaround, and then went for his clothes and dressed.  Not a soundcame from Carrie; she ceased sobbing when she heard him dressing.She thought, at first, with the faintest alarm, of being leftwithout money--not of losing him, though he might be going awaypermanently.  She heard him open the top of the wardrobe and takeout his hat.  Then the dining-room door closed, and she knew hehad gone.
　　After a few moments of silence, she stood up, dry-eyed, andlooked out the window.  Hurstwood was just strolling up thestreet, from the flat, toward Sixth Avenue.
　　The latter made progress along Thirteenth and across FourteenthStreet to Union Square.
　　"Look for work!" he said to himself.  "Look for work! She tellsme to get out and look for work."
　　He tried to shield himself from his own mental accusation, whichtold him that she was right.
　　"What a cursed thing that Mrs. Vance's call was, anyhow," hethought.  "Stood right there, and looked me over.  I know whatshe was thinking."
　　He remembered the few times he had seen her in Seventy-eightStreet.  She was always a swell-looker, and he had tried to puton the air of being worthy of such as she, in front of her.  Now,to think she had caught him looking this way.  He wrinkled hisforehead in his distress.
　　"The devil!" he said a dozen times in an hour.
　　It was a quarter after four when he left the house.  Carrie wasin tears.  There would be no dinner that night.
　　"What the deuce," he said, swaggering mentally to hide his ownshame from himself.  "I'm not so bad.  I'm not down yet."
　　He looked around the square, and seeing the several large hotels,decided to go to one for dinner.  He would get his papers andmake himself comfortable there.
　　He ascended into the fine parlour of the Morton House, then oneof the best New York hotels, and, finding a cushioned seat, read.It did not trouble him much that his decreasing sum of money didnot allow of such extravagance.  Like the morphine fiend, he wasbecoming addicted to his ease.  Anything to relieve his mentaldistress, to satisfy his craving for comfort.  He must do it.  Nothoughts for the morrow--he could not stand to think of it anymore than he could of any other calamity.  Like the certainty ofdeath, he tried to shut the certainty of soon being without adollar completely out of his mind, and he came very near doingit.
　　Well-dressed guests moving to and fro over the thick carpetscarried him back to the old days.  A young lady, a guest of thehouse, playing a piano in an alcove pleased him.  He sat therereading.
　　His dinner cost him $1.50.  By eight o'clock he was through, andthen, seeing guests leaving and the crowd of pleasure-seekersthickening outside wondered where he should go.  Not home.Carrie would be up.  No, he would not go back there this evening.He would stay out and knock around as a man who was independent--not broke--well might.  He bought a cigar, and went outside onthe corner where other individuals were lounging--brokers, racingpeople, thespians--his own flesh and blood.  As he stood there,he thought of the old evenings in Chicago, and how he used todispose of them.  Many's the game he had had.  This took him topoker.
　　"I didn't do that thing right the other day," he thought,referring to his loss of sixty dollars.  "I shouldn't haveweakened.  I could have bluffed that fellow down.  I wasn't inform, that's what ailed me."
　　Then he studied the possibilities of the game as it had beenplayed, and began to figure how he might have won, in severalinstances, by bluffing a little harder.
　　"I'm old enough to play poker and do something with it.  I'll trymy hand to-night."
　　Visions of a big stake floated before him.  Supposing he did wina couple of hundred, wouldn't he be in it? Lots of sports he knewmade their living at this game, and a good living, too.
　　"They always had as much as I had," he thought.
　　So off he went to a poker room in the neighbourhood, feeling muchas he had in the old days.  In this period of self-forgetfulness,aroused first by the shock of argument and perfected by a dinnerin the hotel, with cocktails and cigars, he was as nearly likethe old Hurstwood as he would ever be again.  It was not the oldHurstwood--only a man arguing with a divided conscience and luredby a phantom.
　　This poker room was much like the other one, only it was a backroom in a better drinking resort.  Hurstwood watched a while, andthen, seeing an interesting game, joined in.  As before, it wenteasy for a while, he winning a few times and cheering up, losinga few pots and growing more interested and determined on thataccount.  At last the fascinating game took a strong hold on him.He enjoyed its risks and ventured, on a trifling hand, to bluffthe company and secure a fair stake.  To his self-satisfactionintense and strong, he did it.
　　In the height of this feeling he began to think his luck was withhim.  No one else had done so well.  Now came another moderatehand, and again he tried to open the jack-pot on it.  There wereothers there who were almost reading his heart, so close wastheir observation.
　　"I have three of a kind," said one of the players to himself."I'll just stay with that fellow to the finish."
　　The result was that bidding began.
　　"I raise you ten."
　　"Good."
　　"Ten more."
　　"Good."
　　"Ten again."
　　"Right you are."
　　It got to where Hurstwood had seventy-five dollars up.  The otherman really became serious.  Perhaps this individual (Hurstwood)really did have a stiff hand.
　　"I call," he said.
　　Hurstwood showed his hand.  He was done.  The bitter fact that hehad lost seventy-five dollars made him desperate.
　　"Let's have another pot," he said, grimly.
　　"All right," said the man.
　　Some of the other players quit, but observant loungers took theirplaces.  Time passed, and it came to twelve o'clock.  Hurstwoodheld on, neither winning nor losing much.  Then he grew weary,and on a last hand lost twenty more.  He was sick at heart.
　　At a quarter after one in the morning he came out of the place.The chill, bare streets seemed a mockery of his state.  He walkedslowly west, little thinking of his row with Carrie.  He ascendedthe stairs and went into his room as if there had been notrouble.  It was his loss that occupied his mind.  Sitting downon the bedside he counted his money.  There was now but a hundredand ninety dollars and some change.  He put it up and began toundress.
　　"I wonder what's getting into me, anyhow?" he said.
　　In the morning Carrie scarcely spoke and he felt as if he must goout again.  He had treated her badly, but he could not afford tomake up.  Now desperation seized him, and for a day or two, goingout thus, he lived like a gentleman--or what he conceived to be agentleman--which took money.  For his escapades he was soonpoorer in mind and body, to say nothing of his purse, which hadlost thirty by the process.  Then he came down to cold, bittersense again.
　　"The rent man comes to-day," said Carrie, greeting him thusindifferently three mornings later.
　　"He does?"
　　"Yes; this is the second," answered Carrie.
　　Hurstwood frowned.  Then in despair he got out his purse.
　　"It seems an awful lot to pay for rent," he said.
　　He was nearing his last hundred dollars.
　　Chapter XXXVII
　　THE SPIRIT AWAKENS--NEW SEARCH FOR THE GATE
　　It would be useless to explain how in due time the last fiftydollars was in sight.  The seven hundred, by his process ofhandling, had only carried them into June.  Before the finalhundred mark was reached he began to indicate that a calamity wasapproaching.
　　"I don't know," he said one day, taking a trivial expenditure formeat as a text, "it seems to take an awful lot for us to live."
　　"It doesn't seem to me," said Carrie, "that we spend very much."
　　"My money is nearly gone," he said, "and I hardly know where it'sgone to."
　　"All that seven hundred dollars?" asked Carrie.
　　"All but a hundred."
　　He looked so disconsolate that it scared her.  She began to seethat she herself had been drifting.  She had felt it all thetime.
　　"Well, George," she exclaimed, "why don't you get out and lookfor something? You could find something."
　　"I have looked," he said.  "You can t make people give you aplace."
　　She gazed weakly at him and said: "Well, what do you think youwill do? A hundred dollars won't last long."
　　"I don't know," he said.  "I can't do any more than look."
　　Carrie became frightened over this announcement.  She thoughtdesperately upon the subject.  Frequently she had considered thestage as a door through which she might enter that gilded statewhich she had so much craved.  Now, as in Chicago, it came as alast resource in distress.  Something must be done if he did notget work soon.  Perhaps she would have to go out and battle againalone.
　　She began to wonder how one would go about getting a place.  Herexperience in Chicago proved that she had not tried the rightway.  There must be people who would listen to and try you--menwho would give you an opportunity.
　　They were talking at the breakfast table, a morning or two later,when she brought up the dramatic subject by saying that she sawthat Sarah Bernhardt was coming to this country.  Hurstwood hadseen it, too.
　　"How do people get on the stage, George?" she finally asked,innocently.
　　"I don't know," he said.  "There must be dramatic agents."
　　Carrie was sipping coffee, and did not look up.
　　"Regular people who get you a place?"
　　"Yes, I think so," he answered.
　　Suddenly the air with which she asked attracted his attention.
　　"You're not still thinking about being an actress, are you?" heasked.
　　"No," she answered, "I was just wondering."
　　Without being clear, there was something in the thought which heobjected to.  He did not believe any more, after three years ofobservation, that Carrie would ever do anything great in thatline.  She seemed too simple, too yielding.  His idea of the artwas that it involved something more pompous.  If she tried to geton the stage she would fall into the hands of some cheap managerand become like the rest of them.  He had a good idea of what hemeant by THEM.  Carrie was pretty.  She would get along allright, but where would he be?
　　"I'd get that idea out of my head, if I were you.  It's a lotmore difficult than you think."
　　Carrie felt this to contain, in some way, an aspersion upon herability.
　　"You said I did real well in Chicago," she rejoined.
　　"You did," he answered, seeing that he was arousing opposition,"but Chicago isn't New York, by a big jump."
　　Carrie did not answer this at all.  It hurt her.
　　"The stage," he went on, "is all right if you can be one of thebig guns, but there's nothing to the rest of it.  It takes a longwhile to get up."
　　"Oh, I don't know," said Carrie, slightly aroused.
　　In a flash, he thought he foresaw the result of this thing.  Now,when the worst of his situation was approaching, she would get onthe stage in some cheap way and forsake him.  Strangely, he hadnot conceived well of her mental ability.  That was because hedid not understand the nature of emotional greatness.  He hadnever learned that a person might be emotionally--instead ofintellectually--great.  Avery Hall was too far away for him tolook back and sharply remember.  He had lived with this woman toolong.
　　"Well, I do," he answered.  "If I were you I wouldn't think ofit.  It's not much of a profession for a woman."
　　"It's better than going hungry," said Carrie.  "If you don't wantme to do that, why don't you get work yourself?"
　　There was no answer ready for this.  He had got used to thesuggestion.
　　"Oh, let up," he answered.
　　The result of this was that she secretly resolved to try.  Itdidn't matter about him.  She was not going to be dragged intopoverty and something worse to suit him.  She could act.  Shecould get something and then work up.  What would he say then?She pictured herself already appearing in some fine performanceon Broadway; of going every evening to her dressing-room andmaking up.  Then she would come out at eleven o'clock and see thecarriages ranged about, waiting for the people.  It did notmatter whether she was the star or not.  If she were only oncein, getting a decent salary, wearing the kind of clothes sheliked, having the money to do with, going here and there as shepleased, how delightful it would all be.  Her mind ran over thispicture all the day long.  Hurstwood's dreary state made itsbeauty become more and more vivid.
　　Curiously this idea soon took hold of Hurstwood.  His vanishingsum suggested that he would need sustenance.  Why could notCarrie assist him a little until he could get something?
　　He came in one day with something of this idea in his mind.
　　"I met John B. Drake to-day," he said.  "He's going to open ahotel here in the fall.  He says that he can make a place for methen."
　　"Who is he?" asked Carrie.
　　"He's the man that runs the Grand Pacific in Chicago."
　　"Oh," said Carrie.
　　"I'd get about fourteen hundred a year out of that."
　　"That would be good, wouldn't it?" she said, sympathetically.
　　"If I can only get over this summer," he added, "I think I'll beall right.  I'm hearing from some of my friends again."
　　Carrie swallowed this story in all its pristine beauty.  Shesincerely wished he could get through the summer.  He looked sohopeless.
　　"How much money have you left?"
　　"Only fifty dollars."
　　"Oh, mercy," she exclaimed, "what will we do? It's only twentydays until the rent will be due again."
　　Hurstwood rested his head on his hands and looked blankly at thefloor.
　　"Maybe you could get something in the stage line?" he blandlysuggested.
　　"Maybe I could," said Carrie, glad that some one approved of theidea.
　　"I'll lay my hand to whatever I can get," he said, now that hesaw her brighten up.  "I can get something."
　　She cleaned up the things one morning after he had gone, dressedas neatly as her wardrobe permitted, and set out for Broadway.She did not know that thoroughfare very well.  To her it was awonderful conglomeration of everything great and mighty.  Thetheatres were there--these agencies must be somewhere about.
　　She decided to stop in at the Madison Square Theatre and ask howto find the theatrical agents.  This seemed the sensible way.Accordingly, when she reached that theatre she applied to theclerk at the box office.
　　"Eh?" he said, looking out.  "Dramatic agents? I don't know.You'll find them in the 'Clipper,' though.  They all advertise inthat."
　　"Is that a paper?" said Carrie.
　　"Yes," said the clerk, marvelling at such ignorance of a commonfact.  "You can get it at the news-stands," he added politely,seeing how pretty the inquirer was.
　　Carrie proceeded to get the "Clipper," and tried to find theagents by looking over it as she stood beside the stand.  Thiscould not be done so easily.  Thirteenth Street was a number ofblocks off, but she went back, carrying the precious paper andregretting the waste of time.
　　Hurstwood was already there, sitting in his place.
　　"Where were you?" he asked.
　　"I've been trying to find some dramatic agents."
　　He felt a little diffident about asking concerning her success.The paper she began to scan attracted his attention.
　　"What have you got there?" he asked.
　　"The 'Clipper.' The man said I'd find their addresses in here."
　　"Have you been all the way over to Broadway to find that out? Icould have told you."
　　"Why didn't you?" she asked, without looking up.
　　"You never asked me," he returned.
　　She went hunting aimlessly through the crowded columns.  Her mindwas distracted by this man's indifference.  The difficulty of thesituation she was facing was only added to by all he did.  Self-commiseration brewed in her heart.  Tears trembled along hereyelids but did not fall.  Hurstwood noticed something.
　　"Let me look."
　　To recover herself she went into the front room while hesearched.  Presently she returned.  He had a pencil, and waswriting upon an envelope.
　　"Here're three," he said.
　　Carrie took it and found that one was Mrs. Bermudez, anotherMarcus Jenks, a third Percy Weil.  She paused only a moment, andthen moved toward the door.
　　"I might as well go right away," she said, without looking back.
　　Hurstwood saw her depart with some faint stirrings of shame,which were the expression of a manhood rapidly becomingstultified.  He sat a while, and then it became too much.  He gotup and put on his hat.
　　"I guess I'll go out," he said to himself, and went, strollingnowhere in particular, but feeling somehow that he must go.
　　Carrie's first call was upon Mrs. Bermudez, whose address wasquite the nearest.  It was an old-fashioned residence turned intooffices.  Mrs. Bermudez's offices consisted of what formerly hadbeen a back chamber and a hall bedroom, marked "Private."
　　As Carrie entered she noticed several persons lounging about--men, who said nothing and did nothing.
　　While she was waiting to be noticed, the door of the hall bedroomopened and from it issued two very mannish-looking women, verytightly dressed, and wearing white collars and cuffs.  After themcame a portly lady of about forty-five, light-haired, sharp-eyed,and evidently good-natured.  At least she was smiling.
　　"Now, don't forget about that," said one of the mannish women.
　　"I won't," said the portly woman.  "Let's see," she added, "whereare you the first week in February?""Pittsburg," said the woman.
　　"I'll write you there."
　　"All right," said the other, and the two passed out.
　　Instantly the portly lady's face became exceedingly sober andshrewd.  She turned about and fixed on Carrie a very searchingeye.
　　"Well," she said, "young woman, what can I do for you?"
　　"Are you Mrs. Bermudez?"
　　"Yes."
　　"Well," said Carrie, hesitating how to begin, "do you get placesfor persons upon the stage?"
　　"Yes."
　　"Could you get me one?"
　　"Have you ever had any experience?"
　　"A very little," said Carrie.
　　"Whom did you play with?"
　　"Oh, with no one," said Carrie.  "It was just a show gotten----"
　　"Oh, I see," said the woman, interrupting her.  "No, I don't knowof anything now."
　　Carrie's countenance fell.
　　"You want to get some New York experience," concluded the affableMrs. Bermudez.  "We'll take your name, though."
　　Carrie stood looking while the lady retired to her office.
　　"What is your address?" inquired a young lady behind the counter,taking up the curtailed conversation.
　　"Mrs. George Wheeler," said Carrie, moving over to where she waswriting.  The woman wrote her address in full and then allowedher to depart at her leisure.
　　She encountered a very similar experience in the office of Mr.Jenks, only he varied it by saying at the close: "If you couldplay at some local house, or had a programme with your name onit, I might do something."
　　In the third place the individual asked:
　　"What sort of work do you want to do?"
　　"What do you mean?" said Carrie.
　　"Well, do you want to get in a comedy or on the vaudeville or inthe chorus?"
　　"Oh, I'd like to get a part in a play," said Carrie.
　　"Well," said the man, "it'll cost you something to do that.""How much?" said Carrie, who, ridiculous as it may seem, had notthought of this before.
　　"Well, that's for you to say," he answered shrewdly.
　　Carrie looked at him curiously.  She hardly knew how to continuethe inquiry.
　　"Could you get me a part if I paid?"
　　"If we didn't you'd get your money back."
　　"Oh," she said.
　　The agent saw he was dealing with an inexperienced soul, andcontinued accordingly.
　　"You'd want to deposit fifty dollars, anyway.  No agent wouldtrouble about you for less than that."
　　Carrie saw a light.
　　"Thank you," she said.  "I'll think about it."
　　She started to go, and then bethought herself.
　　"How soon would I get a place?" she asked.
　　"Well, that's hard to say," said the man.  "You might get one ina week, or it might be a month.  You'd get the first thing thatwe thought you could do."
　　"I see," said Carrie, and then, half-smiling to be agreeable, shewalked out.
　　The agent studied a moment, and then said to himself:
　　"It's funny how anxious these women are to get on the stage."
　　Carrie found ample food for reflection in the fifty-dollarproposition.  "Maybe they'd take my money and not give meanything," she thought.  She had some jewelry--a diamond ring andpin and several other pieces.  She could get fifty dollars forthose if she went to a pawnbroker.
　　Hurstwood was home before her.  He had not thought she would beso long seeking.
　　"Well?" he said, not venturing to ask what news.
　　"I didn't find out anything to-day," said Carrie, taking off hergloves.  "They all want money to get you a place."
　　"How much?" asked Hurstwood.
　　"Fifty dollars."
　　"They don't want anything, do they?"
　　"Oh, they're like everybody else.  You can't tell whether they'dever get you anything after you did pay them."
　　"Well, I wouldn't put up fifty on that basis," said Hurstwood, asif he were deciding, money in hand.
　　"I don't know," said Carrie.  "I think I'll try some of themanagers."
　　Hurstwood heard this, dead to the horror of it.  He rocked alittle to and fro, and chewed at his finger.  It seemed all verynatural in such extreme states.  He would do better later on.
　　Chapter XXXVIII
　　IN ELF LAND DISPORTING--THE GRIM WORLD WITHOUT
　　When Carrie renewed her search, as she did the next day, going tothe Casino, she found that in the opera chorus, as in otherfields, employment is difficult to secure.  Girls who can standin a line and look pretty are as numerous as labourers who canswing a pick.  She found there was no discrimination between oneand the other of applicants, save as regards a conventionalstandard of prettiness and form.  Their own opinion or knowledgeof their ability went for nothing.
　　"Where shall I find Mr. Gray?" she asked of a sulky doorman atthe stage entrance of the Casino.
　　"You can't see him now; he's busy."
　　"Do you know when I can see him?"
　　"Got an appointment with him?"
　　"No."
　　"Well, you'll have to call at his office."
　　"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Carrie.  "Where is his office?"
　　He gave her the number.
　　She knew there was no need of calling there now.  He would not bein.  Nothing remained but to employ the intermediate hours insearch.
　　The dismal story of ventures in other places is quickly told.Mr. Daly saw no one save by appointment.  Carrie waited an hourin a dingy office, quite in spite of obstacles, to learn thisfact of the placid, indifferent Mr. Dorney.
　　"You will have to write and ask him to see you."
　　So she went away.
　　At the Empire Theatre she found a hive of peculiarly listless andindifferent individuals.  Everything ornately upholstered,everything carefully finished, everything remarkably reserved.
　　At the Lyceum she entered one of those secluded, under-stairwayclosets, berugged and bepaneled, which causes one to feel thegreatness of all positions of authority.  Here was reserve itselfdone into a box-office clerk, a doorman, and an assistant,glorying in their fine positions.
　　"Ah, be very humble now--very humble indeed.  Tell us what it isyou require.  Tell it quickly, nervously, and without a vestigeof self-respect.  If no trouble to us in any way, we may see whatwe can do."
　　This was the atmosphere of the Lyceum--the attitude, for thatmatter, of every managerial office in the city.  These littleproprietors of businesses are lords indeed on their own ground.
　　Carrie came away wearily, somewhat more abashed for her pains.
　　Hurstwood heard the details of the weary and unavailing searchthat evening.
　　"I didn't get to see any one," said Carrie.  "I just walked, andwalked, and waited around."
　　Hurstwood only looked at her.
　　"I suppose you have to have some friends before you can get in,"she added, disconsolately.
　　Hurstwood saw the difficulty of this thing, and yet it did notseem so terrible.  Carrie was tired and dispirited, but now shecould rest.  Viewing the world from his rocking-chair, itsbitterness did not seem to approach so rapidly.  To-morrow wasanother day.
　　To-morrow came, and the next, and the next.
　　Carrie saw the manager at the Casino once.
　　"Come around," he said, "the first of next week.  I may make somechanges then."
　　He was a large and corpulent individual, surfeited with goodclothes and good eating, who judged women as another wouldhorseflesh.  Carrie was pretty and graceful.  She might be put ineven if she did not have any experience.  One of the proprietorshad suggested that the chorus was a little weak on looks.
　　The first of next week was some days off yet.  The first of themonth was drawing near.  Carrie began to worry as she had neverworried before.
　　"Do you really look for anything when you go out?" she askedHurstwood one morning as a climax to some painful thoughts of herown.
　　"Of course I do," he said pettishly, troubling only a little overthe disgrace of the insinuation.
　　"I'd take anything," she said, "for the present.  It will soon bethe first of the month again."
　　She looked the picture of despair.
　　Hurstwood quit reading his paper and changed his clothes.
　　"He would look for something," he thought.  "He would go and seeif some brewery couldn't get him in somewhere.  Yes, he wouldtake a position as bartender, if he could get it."
　　It was the same sort of pilgrimage he had made before.  One ortwo slight rebuffs, and the bravado disappeared.
　　"No use," he thought.  "I might as well go on back home."
　　Now that his money was so low, he began to observe his clothesand feel that even his best ones were beginning to lookcommonplace.  This was a bitter thought.
　　Carrie came in after he did.
　　"I went to see some of the variety managers," she said,aimlessly.  "You have to have an act.  They don't want anybodythat hasn't."
　　"I saw some of the brewery people to-day," said Hurstwood.  "Oneman told me he'd try to make a place for me in two or threeweeks."
　　In the face of so much distress on Carrie's part, he had to makesome showing, and it was thus he did so.  It was lassitude'sapology to energy.
　　Monday Carrie went again to the Casino.
　　"Did I tell you to come around to day?" said the manager, lookingher over as she stood before him.
　　"You said the first of the week," said Carrie, greatly abashed.
　　"Ever had any experience?" he asked again, almost severely.
　　Carrie owned to ignorance.
　　He looked her over again as he stirred among some papers.  He wassecretly pleased with this pretty, disturbed-looking young woman."Come around to the theatre to-morrow morning."
　　Carrie's heart bounded to her throat.
　　"I will," she said with difficulty.  She could see he wanted her,and turned to go.
　　"Would he really put her to work? Oh, blessed fortune, could itbe?"
　　Already the hard rumble of the city through the open windowsbecame pleasant.
　　A sharp voice answered her mental interrogation, driving away allimmediate fears on that score.
　　"Be sure you're there promptly," the manager said roughly."You'll be dropped if you're not."
　　Carrie hastened away.  She did not quarrel now with Hurstwood'sidleness.  She had a place--she had a place! This sang in herears.
　　In her delight she was almost anxious to tell Hurstwood.  But, asshe walked homeward, and her survey of the facts of the casebecame larger, she began to think of the anomaly of her findingwork in several weeks and his lounging in idleness for a numberof months.
　　"Why don't he get something?" she openly said to herself.  "If Ican he surely ought to.  It wasn't very hard for me."
　　She forgot her youth and her beauty.  The handicap of age she didnot, in her enthusiasm, perceive.
　　Thus, ever, the voice of success.Still, she could not keep her secret.  She tried to be calm andindifferent, but it was a palpable sham.
　　"Well?" he said, seeing her relieved face.
　　"I have a place."
　　"You have?" he said, breathing a better breath.
　　"Yes."
　　"What sort of a place is it?" he asked, feeling in his veins asif now he might get something good also.
　　"In the chorus," she answered.
　　"Is it the Casino show you told me about?"
　　"Yes," she answered.  "I begin rehearsing to-morrow."
　　There was more explanation volunteered by Carrie, because she washappy.  At last Hurstwood said:
　　"Do you know how much you'll get?"
　　"No, I didn't want to ask," said Carrie.  "I guess they paytwelve or fourteen dollars a week."
　　"About that, I guess," said Hurstwood.
　　There was a good dinner in the flat that evening, owing to themere lifting of the terrible strain.  Hurstwood went out for ashave, and returned with a fair-sized sirloin steak.
　　"Now, to-morrow," he thought, "I'll look around myself," and withrenewed hope he lifted his eyes from the ground.
　　On the morrow Carrie reported promptly and was given a place inthe line.  She saw a large, empty, shadowy play-house, stillredolent of the perfumes and blazonry of the night, and notablefor its rich, oriental appearance.  The wonder of it awed anddelighted her.  Blessed be its wondrous reality.  How hard shewould try to be worthy of it.  It was above the common mass,above idleness, above want, above insignificance.  People came toit in finery and carriages to see.  It was ever a centre of lightand mirth.  And here she was of it.  Oh, if she could onlyremain, how happy would be her days!
　　"What is your name?" said the manager, who was conducting thedrill.
　　"Madenda," she replied, instantly mindful of the name Drouet hadselected in Chicago.  "Carrie Madenda."
　　"Well, now, Miss Madenda," he said, very affably, as Carriethought, "you go over there."
　　Then he called to a young woman who was already of the company:
　　"Miss Clark, you pair with Miss Madenda."
　　This young lady stepped forward, so that Carrie saw where to go,and the rehearsal began.
　　Carrie soon found that while this drilling had some slightresemblance to the rehearsals as conducted at Avery Hall, theattitude of the manager was much more pronounced.  She hadmarvelled at the insistence and superior airs of Mr. Millice, butthe individual conducting here had the same insistence, coupledwith almost brutal roughness.  As the drilling proceeded, heseemed to wax exceedingly wroth over trifles, and to increase hislung power in proportion.  It was very evident that he had agreat contempt for any assumption of dignity or innocence on thepart of these young women.
　　"Clark," he would call--meaning, of course, Miss Clark--"whydon't you catch step there?"
　　"By fours, right! Right, I said, right! For heaven's sake, get onto yourself! Right!" and in saying this he would lift the lastsounds into a vehement roar.
　　"Maitland! Maitland!" he called once.
　　A nervous, comely-dressed little girl stepped out.  Carrietrembled for her out of the fulness of her own sympathies andfear.
　　"Yes, sir," said Miss Maitland.
　　"Is there anything the matter with your ears?"
　　"No, sir."
　　"Do you know what 'column left' means?"
　　"Yes, sir."
　　"Well, what are you stumbling around the right for? Want to breakup the line?"
　　"I was just"
　　"Never mind what you were just.  Keep your ears open."
　　Carrie pitied, and trembled for her turn.
　　Yet another suffered the pain of personal rebuke.
　　"Hold on a minute," cried the manager, throwing up his hands, asif in despair.  His demeanour was fierce.
　　"Elvers," he shouted, "what have you got in your mouth?"
　　"Nothing," said Miss Elvers, while some smiled and stoodnervously by.
　　"Well, are you talking?"
　　"No, sir."
　　"Well, keep your mouth still then.  Now, all together again."
　　At last Carrie's turn came.  It was because of her extremeanxiety to do all that was required that brought on the trouble.
　　She heard some one called.
　　"Mason," said the voice.  "Miss Mason."
　　She looked around to see who it could be.  A girl behind shovedher a little, but she did not understand.
　　"You, you!" said the manager.  "Can't you hear?"
　　"Oh," said Carrie, collapsing, and blushing fiercely.
　　"Isn't your name Mason?" asked the manager.
　　"No, sir," said Carrie, "it's Madenda."
　　"Well, what's the matter with your feet? Can't you dance?"
　　"Yes, sir," said Carrie, who had long since learned this art.
　　"Why don't you do it then? Don't go shuffling along as if youwere dead.  I've got to have people with life in them."
　　Carrie's cheek burned with a crimson heat.  Her lips trembled alittle.
　　"Yes, sir," she said.
　　It was this constant urging, coupled with irascibility andenergy, for three long hours.  Carrie came away worn enough inbody, but too excited in mind to notice it.  She meant to go homeand practise her evolutions as prescribed.  She would not err inany way, if she could help it.
　　When she reached the flat Hurstwood was not there.  For a wonderhe was out looking for work, as she supposed.  She took only amouthful to eat and then practised on, sustained by visions offreedom from financial distress--"The sound of glory ringing inher ears."
　　When Hurstwood returned he was not so elated as when he wentaway, and now she was obliged to drop practice and get dinner.Here was an early irritation.  She would have her work and this.Was she going to act and keep house?
　　"I'll not do it," she said, "after I get started.  He can takehis meals out."
　　Each day thereafter brought its cares.  She found it was not sucha wonderful thing to be in the chorus, and she also learned thather salary would be twelve dollars a week.  After a few days shehad her first sight of those high and mighties--the leadingladies and gentlemen.  She saw that they were privileged anddeferred to.  She was nothing--absolutely nothing at all.
　　At home was Hurstwood, daily giving her cause for thought.  Heseemed to get nothing to do, and yet he made bold to inquire howshe was getting along.  The regularity with which he did thissmacked of some one who was waiting to live upon her labour.  Nowthat she had a visible means of support, this irritated her.  Heseemed to be depending upon her little twelve dollars.
　　"How are you getting along?" he would blandly inquire.
　　"Oh, all right," she would reply.
　　"Find it easy?"
　　"It will be all right when I get used to it."
　　His paper would then engross his thoughts.
　　"I got some lard," he would add, as an afterthought.  "I thoughtmaybe you might want to make some biscuit."
　　The calm suggestion of the man astonished her a little,especially in the light of recent developments.  Her dawningindependence gave her more courage to observe, and she felt as ifshe wanted to say things.  Still she could not talk to him as shehad to Drouet.  There was something in the man's manner of whichshe had always stood in awe.  He seemed to have some invisiblestrength in reserve.
　　One day, after her first week's rehearsal, what she expected cameopenly to the surface.
　　"We'll have to be rather saving," he said, laying down some meathe had purchased.  "You won't get any money for a week or soyet."
　　"No," said Carrie, who was stirring a pan at the stove.
　　"I've only got the rent and thirteen dollars more," he added.
　　"That's it," she said to herself.  "I'm to use my money now."
　　Instantly she remembered that she had hoped to buy a few thingsfor herself.  She needed clothes.  Her hat was not nice.
　　"What will twelve dollars do towards keeping up this flat?" shethought.  "I can't do it.  Why doesn't he get something to do?"
　　The important night of the first real performance came.  She didnot suggest to Hurstwood that he come and see.  He did not thinkof going.  It would only be money wasted.  She had such a smallpart.
　　The advertisements were already in the papers; the posters uponthe bill-boards.  The leading lady and many members were cited.Carrie was nothing.
　　As in Chicago, she was seized with stage fright as the very firstentrance of the ballet approached, but later she recovered.  Theapparent and painful insignificance of the part took fear awayfrom her.  She felt that she was so obscure it did not matter.Fortunately, she did not have to wear tights.  A group of twelvewere assigned pretty golden-hued skirts which came only to a lineabout an inch above the knee.  Carrie happened to be one of thetwelve.
　　In standing about the stage, marching, and occasionally liftingup her voice in the general chorus, she had a chance to observethe audience and to see the inauguration of a great hit.  Therewas plenty of applause, but she could not help noting how poorlysome of the women of alleged ability did.
　　"I could do better than that," Carrie ventured to herself, inseveral instances.  To do her justice, she was right.
　　After it was over she dressed quickly, and as the manager hadscolded some others and passed her, she imagined she must haveproved satisfactory.  She wanted to get out quickly, because sheknew but few, and the stars were gossiping.  Outside werecarriages and some correct youths in attractive clothing,waiting.  Carrie saw that she was scanned closely.  The flutterof an eyelash would have brought her a companion.  That she didnot give.
　　One experienced youth volunteered, anyhow.
　　"Not going home alone, are you?" he said.
　　Carrie merely hastened her steps and took the Sixth Avenue car.Her head was so full of the wonder of it that she had time fornothing else.
　　"Did you hear any more from the brewery?" she asked at the end ofthe week, hoping by the question to stir him on to action.
　　"No," he answered, "they're not quite ready yet.  I thinksomething will come of that, though."
　　She said nothing more then, objecting to giving up her own money,and yet feeling that such would have to be the case.  Hurstwoodfelt the crisis, and artfully decided to appeal to Carrie.  Hehad long since realised how good-natured she was, how much shewould stand.  There was some little shame in him at the thoughtof doing so, but he justified himself with the thought that hereally would get something.  Rent day gave him his opportunity.
　　"Well," he said, as he counted it out, "that's about the last ofmy money.  I'll have to get something pretty soon."
　　Carrie looked at him askance, half-suspicious of an appeal.
　　"If I could only hold out a little longer I think I could getsomething.  Drake is sure to open a hotel here in September."
　　"Is he?" said Carrie, thinking of the short month that stillremained until that time.
　　"Would you mind helping me out until then?" he said appealingly."I think I'll be all right after that time."
　　"No," said Carrie, feeling sadly handicapped by fate.
　　"We can get along if we economise.  I'll pay you back all right."
　　"Oh, I'll help you," said Carrie, feeling quite hardhearted atthus forcing him to humbly appeal, and yet her desire for thebenefit of her earnings wrung a faint protest from her.
　　"Why don't you take anything, George, temporarily?" she said."What difference does it make? Maybe, after a while, you'll getsomething better."
　　"I will take anything," he said, relieved, and wincing underreproof.  "I'd just as leave dig on the streets.  Nobody knows mehere."
　　"Oh, you needn't do that," said Carrie, hurt by the pity of it."But there must be other things."
　　"I'll get something!" he said, assuming determination.
　　Then he went back to his paper.
　　Chapter XXXIX
　　OF LIGHTS AND OF SHADOWS--THE PARTING OF WORLDS
　　What Hurstwood got as the result of this determination was moreself-assurance that each particular day was not the day.  At thesame time, Carrie passed through thirty days of mental distress.
　　Her need of clothes--to say nothing of her desire for ornaments--grew rapidly as the fact developed that for all her work she wasnot to have them.  The sympathy she felt for Hurstwood, at thetime he asked her to tide him over, vanished with these newerurgings of decency.  He was not always renewing his request, butthis love of good appearance was.  It insisted, and Carrie wishedto satisfy it, wished more and more that Hurstwood was not in theway.
　　Hurstwood reasoned, when he neared the last ten dollars, that hehad better keep a little pocket change and not become whollydependent for car-fare, shaves, and the like; so when this sumwas still in his hand he announced himself as penniless.
　　"I'm clear out," he said to Carrie one afternoon.  "I paid forsome coal this morning, and that took all but ten or fifteencents."
　　"I've got some money there in my purse."
　　Hurstwood went to get it, starting for a can of tomatoes.  Carriescarcely noticed that this was the beginning of the new order.He took out fifteen cents and bought the can with it.  Thereafterit was dribs and drabs of this sort, until one morning Carriesuddenly remembered that she would not be back until close todinner time.
　　"We're all out of flour," she said; "you'd better get some thisafternoon.  We haven't any meat, either.  How would it do if wehad liver and bacon?"
　　"Suits me," said Hurstwood.
　　"Better get a half or three-quarters of a pound of that."
　　"Half 'll be enough," volunteered Hurstwood.
　　She opened her purse and laid down a half dollar.  He pretendednot to notice it.
　　Hurstwood bought the flour--which all grocers sold in 3 1/2-poundpackages--for thirteen cents and paid fifteen cents for a half-pound of liver and bacon.  He left the packages, together withthe balance of twenty-two cents, upon the kitchen table, whereCarrie found it.  It did not escape her that the change wasaccurate.  There was something sad in realising that, after all,all that he wanted of her was something to eat.  She felt as ifhard thoughts were unjust.  Maybe he would get something yet.  Hehad no vices.
　　That very evening, however, on going into the theatre, one of thechorus girls passed her all newly arrayed in a pretty mottledtweed suit, which took Carrie's eye.  The young woman wore a finebunch of violets and seemed in high spirits.  She smiled atCarrie good-naturedly as she passed, showing pretty, even teeth,and Carrie smiled back.
　　"She can afford to dress well," thought Carrie, "and so could I,if I could only keep my money.  I haven't a decent tie of anykind to wear."
　　She put out her foot and looked at her shoe reflectively."I'll get a pair of shoes Saturday, anyhow; I don't care whathappens."
　　One of the sweetest and most sympathetic little chorus girls inthe company made friends with her because in Carrie she foundnothing to frighten her away.  She was a gay little Manon,unwitting of society's fierce conception of morality, but,nevertheless, good to her neighbour and charitable.  Littlelicense was allowed the chorus in the matter of conversation,but, nevertheless, some was indulged in.
　　"It's warm to-night, isn't it?" said this girl, arrayed in pinkfleshings and an imitation golden helmet.  She also carried ashining shield.
　　"Yes; it is," said Carrie, pleased that some one should talk toher.
　　"I'm almost roasting," said the girl.
　　Carrie looked into her pretty face, with its large blue eyes, andsaw little beads of moisture.
　　"There's more marching in this opera than ever I did before,"added the girl.
　　"Have you been in others?" asked Carrie, surprised at herexperience.
　　"Lots of them," said the girl; "haven't you?"
　　"This is my first experience."
　　"Oh, is it? I thought I saw you the time they ran 'The Queen'sMate' here."
　　"No," said Carrie, shaking her head; "not me."
　　This conversation was interrupted by the blare of the orchestraand the sputtering of the calcium lights in the wings as the linewas called to form for a new entrance.  No further opportunityfor conversation occurred, but the next evening, when they weregetting ready for the stage, this girl appeared anew at her side.
　　"They say this show is going on the road next month."
　　"Is it?" said Carrie.
　　"Yes; do you think you'll go?"
　　"I don't know; I guess so, if they'll take me."
　　"Oh, they'll take you.  I wouldn't go.  They won't give you anymore, and it will cost you everything you make to live.  I neverleave New York.  There are too many shows going on here."
　　"Can you always get in another show?"
　　"I always have.  There's one going on up at the Broadway thismonth.  I'm going to try and get in that if this one reallygoes."
　　Carrie heard this with aroused intelligence.  Evidently it wasn'tso very difficult to get on.  Maybe she also could get a place ifthis show went away."Do they all pay about the same?" she asked.
　　"Yes.  Sometimes you get a little more.  This show doesn't payvery much."
　　"I get twelve," said Carrie.
　　"Do you?" said the girl.  "They pay me fifteen, and you do morework than I do.  I wouldn't stand it if I were you.  They're justgiving you less because they think you don't know.  You ought tobe making fifteen."
　　"Well, I'm not," said Carrie.
　　"Well, you'll get more at the next place if you want it," went onthe girl, who admired Carrie very much.  "You do fine, and themanager knows it."
　　To say the truth, Carrie did unconsciously move about with an airpleasing and somewhat distinctive.  It was due wholly to hernatural manner and total lack of self-consciousness.
　　"Do you suppose I could get more up at the Broadway?"
　　"Of course you can," answered the girl.  "You come with me when Igo.  I'll do the talking."
　　Carrie heard this, flushing with thankfulness.  She liked thislittle gaslight soldier.  She seemed so experienced and self-reliant in her tinsel helmet and military accoutrements.
　　"My future must be assured if I can always get work this way,"thought Carrie.
　　Still, in the morning, when her household duties would infringeupon her and Hurstwood sat there, a perfect load to contemplate,her fate seemed dismal and unrelieved.  It did not take so verymuch to feed them under Hurstwood's close-measured buying, andthere would possibly be enough for rent, but it left nothingelse.  Carrie bought the shoes and some other things, whichcomplicated the rent problem very seriously.  Suddenly, a weekfrom the fatal day, Carrie realised that they were going to runshort.
　　"I don't believe," she exclaimed, looking into her purse atbreakfast, "that I'll have enough to pay the rent."
　　"How much have you?" inquired Hurstwood.
　　"Well, I've got twenty-two dollars, but there's everything to bepaid for this week yet, and if I use all I get Saturday to paythis, there won't be any left for next week.  Do you think yourhotel man will open his hotel this month?"
　　"I think so," returned Hurstwood.  "He said he would."
　　After a while, Hurstwood said:
　　"Don't worry about it.  Maybe the grocer will wait.  He can dothat.  We've traded there long enough to make him trust us for aweek or two."
　　"Do you think he will?" she asked.
　　"I think so."On this account, Hurstwood, this very day, looked grocer Oesloggeclearly in the eye as he ordered a pound of coffee, and said:
　　"Do you mind carrying my account until the end of every week?"
　　"No, no, Mr. Wheeler," said Mr. Oeslogge.  "Dat iss all right."
　　Hurstwood, still tactful in distress, added nothing to this.  Itseemed an easy thing.  He looked out of the door, and thengathered up his coffee when ready and came away.  The game of adesperate man had begun.
　　Rent was paid, and now came the grocer.  Hurstwood managed bypaying out of his own ten and collecting from Carrie at the endof the week.  Then he delayed a day next time settling with thegrocer, and so soon had his ten back, with Oeslogge getting hispay on this Thursday or Friday for last Saturday's bill.
　　This entanglement made Carrie anxious for a change of some sort.Hurstwood did not seem to realise that she had a right toanything.  He schemed to make what she earned cover all expenses,but seemed not to trouble over adding anything himself.
　　"He talks about worrying," thought Carrie.  "If he worried enoughhe couldn't sit there and wait for me.  He'd get something to do.No man could go seven months without finding something if hetried."
　　The sight of him always around in his untidy clothes and gloomyappearance drove Carrie to seek relief in other places.  Twice aweek there were matinees, and then Hurstwood ate a cold snack,which he prepared himself.  Two other days there were rehearsalsbeginning at ten in the morning and lasting usually until one.Now, to this Carrie added a few visits to one or two chorusgirls, including the blue-eyed soldier of the golden helmet.  Shedid it because it was pleasant and a relief from dulness of thehome over which her husband brooded.
　　The blue-eyed soldier's name was Osborne--Lola Osborne.  Her roomwas in Nineteenth Street near Fourth Avenue, a block now given upwholly to office buildings.  Here she had a comfortable backroom, looking over a collection of back yards in which grew anumber of shade trees pleasant to see.
　　"Isn't your home in New York?" she asked of Lola one day.
　　"Yes; but I can't get along with my people.  They always want meto do what they want.  Do you live here?"
　　"Yes," said Carrie.
　　"With your family?"
　　Carrie was ashamed to say that she was married.  She had talkedso much about getting more salary and confessed to so muchanxiety about her future, that now, when the direct question offact was waiting, she could not tell this girl.
　　"With some relatives," she answered.
　　Miss Osborne took it for granted that, like herself, Carrie'stime was her own.  She invariably asked her to stay, proposinglittle outings and other things of that sort until Carrie beganneglecting her dinner hours.  Hurstwood noticed it, but felt inno position to quarrel with her.  Several times she came so lateas scarcely to have an hour in which to patch up a meal and startfor the theatre.
　　"Do you rehearse in the afternoons?" Hurstwood once asked,concealing almost completely the cynical protest and regret whichprompted it.
　　"No; I was looking around for another place," said Carrie.
　　As a matter of fact she was, but only in such a way as furnishedthe least straw of an excuse.  Miss Osborne and she had gone tothe office of the manager who was to produce the new opera at theBroadway and returned straight to the former's room, where theyhad been since three o'clock.
　　Carrie felt this question to be an infringement on her liberty.She did not take into account how much liberty she was securing.Only the latest step, the newest freedom, must not be questioned.
　　Hurstwood saw it all clearly enough.  He was shrewd after hiskind, and yet there was enough decency in the man to stop himfrom making any effectual protest.  In his almost inexplicableapathy he was content to droop supinely while Carrie drifted outof his life, just as he was willing supinely to see opportunitypass beyond his control.  He could not help clinging andprotesting in a mild, irritating, and ineffectual way, however--away that simply widened the breach by slow degrees.
　　A further enlargement of this chasm between them came when themanager, looking between the wings upon the brightly lightedstage where the chorus was going through some of its glitteringevolutions, said to the master of the ballet:
　　"Who is that fourth girl there on the right--the one coming roundat the end now?"
　　"Oh," said the ballet-master, "that's Miss Madenda."
　　"She's good looking.  Why don't you let her head that line?"
　　"I will," said the man.
　　"Just do that.  She'll look better there than the woman you'vegot."
　　"All right.  I will do that," said the master.
　　The next evening Carrie was called out, much as if for an error.
　　"You lead your company to night," said the master.
　　"Yes, sir," said Carrie.
　　"Put snap into it," he added.  "We must have snap."
　　"Yes, sir," replied Carrie.
　　Astonished at this change, she thought that the heretofore leadermust be ill; but when she saw her in the line, with a distinctexpression of something unfavourable in her eye, she began tothink that perhaps it was merit.
　　She had a chic way of tossing her head to one side, and holdingher arms as if for action--not listlessly.  In front of the linethis showed up even more effectually.
　　"That girl knows how to carry herself," said the manager, anotherevening.  He began to think that he should like to talk with her.If he hadn't made it a rule to have nothing to do with themembers of the chorus, he would have approached her mostunbendingly.
　　"Put that girl at the head of the white column," he suggested tothe man in charge of the ballet.
　　This white column consisted of some twenty girls, all in snow-white flannel trimmed with silver and blue.  Its leader was moststunningly arrayed in the same colours, elaborated, however, withepaulets and a belt of silver, with a short sword dangling at oneside.  Carrie was fitted for this costume, and a few days laterappeared, proud of her new laurels.  She was especially gratifiedto find that her salary was now eighteen instead of twelve.
　　Hurstwood heard nothing about this.
　　"I'll not give him the rest of my money," said Carrie.  "I doenough.  I am going to get me something to wear."
　　As a matter of fact, during this second month she had been buyingfor herself as recklessly as she dared, regardless of theconsequences.  There were impending more complications rent day,and more extension of the credit system in the neighbourhood.Now, however, she proposed to do better by herself.
　　Her first move was to buy a shirt waist, and in studying theseshe found how little her money would buy--how much, if she couldonly use all.  She forgot that if she were alone she would haveto pay for a room and board, and imagined that every cent of hereighteen could be spent for clothes and things that she liked.
　　At last she picked upon something, which not only used up all hersurplus above twelve, but invaded that sum.  She knew she wasgoing too far, but her feminine love of finery prevailed.  Thenext day Hurstwood said:
　　"We owe the grocer five dollars and forty cents this week."
　　"Do we?" said Carrie, frowning a little.
　　She looked in her purse to leave it.
　　"I've only got eight dollars and twenty cents altogether."
　　"We owe the milkman sixty cents," added Hurstwood.
　　"Yes, and there's the coal man," said Carrie.
　　Hurstwood said nothing.  He had seen the new things she wasbuying; the way she was neglecting household duties; thereadiness with which she was slipping out afternoons and staying.He felt that something was going to happen.  All at once shespoke:
　　"I don't know," she said; "I can't do it all.  I don't earnenough."
　　This was a direct challenge.  Hurstwood had to take it up.  Hetried to be calm.
　　"I don't want you to do it all," he said.  "I only want a littlehelp until I can get something to do."
　　"Oh, yes," answered Carrie.  "That's always the way.  It takesmore than I can earn to pay for things.  I don't see what I'mgoing to do.
　　"Well, I've tried to get something," he exclaimed.  What do youwant me to do?"
　　"You couldn't have tried so very hard," said Carrie.  "I gotsomething."
　　"Well, I did," he said, angered almost to harsh words.  "Youneedn't throw up your success to me.  All I asked was a littlehelp until I could get something.  I'm not down yet.  I'll comeup all right."
　　He tried to speak steadily, but his voice trembled a little.
　　Carrie's anger melted on the instant.  She felt ashamed.
　　"Well," she said, "here's the money," and emptied it out on thetable.  "I haven't got quite enough to pay it all.  If they canwait until Saturday, though, I'll have some more."
　　"You keep it," said Hurstwood sadly.  "I only want enough to paythe grocer."
　　She put it back, and proceeded to get dinner early and in goodtime.  Her little bravado made her feel as if she ought to makeamends.
　　In a little while their old thoughts returned to both.
　　"She's making more than she says," thought Hurstwood.  "She saysshe's making twelve, but that wouldn't buy all those things.  Idon't care.  Let her keep her money.  I'll get something againone of these days.  Then she can go to the deuce."
　　He only said this in his anger, but it prefigured a possiblecourse of action and attitude well enough.
　　"I don't care," thought Carrie.  "He ought to be told to get outand do something.  It isn't right that I should support him."
　　In these days Carrie was introduced to several youths, friends ofMiss Osborne, who were of the kind most aptly described as gayand festive.  They called once to get Miss Osborne for anafternoon drive.  Carrie was with her at the time.
　　"Come and go along," said Lola.
　　"No, I can't," said Carrie.
　　"Oh, yes, come and go.  What have you got to do?"
　　"I have to be home by five," said Carrie.
　　"What for?"
　　"Oh, dinner."
　　"They'll take us to dinner," said Lola.
　　"Oh, no," said Carrie.  "I won't go.  I can't."
　　"Oh, do come.  They're awful nice boys.  We'll get you back intime.  We're only going for a drive in Central Park."Carrie thought a while, and at last yielded.
　　"Now, I must be back by half-past four," she said.
　　The information went in one ear of Lola and out the other.
　　After Drouet and Hurstwood, there was the least touch of cynicismin her attitude toward young men--especially of the gay andfrivolous sort.  She felt a little older than they.  Some oftheir pretty compliments seemed silly.  Still, she was young inheart and body and youth appealed to her.
　　"Oh, we'll be right back, Miss Madenda," said one of the chaps,bowing.  "You wouldn't think we'd keep you over time, now, wouldyou?"
　　"Well, I don't know," said Carrie, smiling.
　　They were off for a drive--she, looking about and noticing fineclothing, the young men voicing those silly pleasantries and weakquips which pass for humour in coy circles.  Carrie saw the greatpark parade of carriages, beginning at the Fifty-ninth Streetentrance and winding past the Museum of Art to the exit at OneHundred and Tenth Street and Seventh Avenue.  Her eye was oncemore taken by the show of wealth--the elaborate costumes, elegantharnesses, spirited horses, and, above all, the beauty.  Oncemore the plague of poverty galled her, but now she forgot in ameasure her own troubles so far as to forget Hurstwood.  Hewaited until four, five, and even six.  It was getting dark whenhe got up out of his chair.
　　"I guess she isn't coming home," he said, grimly.
　　"That's the way," he thought.  "She's getting a start now.  I'mout of it."
　　Carrie had really discovered her neglect, but only at a quarterafter five, and the open carriage was now far up Seventh Avenue,near the Harlem River.
　　"What time is it?" she inquired.  "I must be getting back."
　　"A quarter after five," said her companion, consulting anelegant, open-faced watch.
　　"Oh, dear me!" exclaimed Carrie.  Then she settled back with asigh.  "There's no use crying over spilt milk," she said.  "It'stoo late."
　　"Of course it is," said the youth, who saw visions of a finedinner now, and such invigorating talk as would result in areunion after the show.  He was greatly taken with Carrie."We'll drive down to Delmonico's now and have something there,won't we, Orrin?"
　　"To be sure," replied Orrin, gaily.
　　Carrie thought of Hurstwood.  Never before had she neglecteddinner without an excuse.
　　They drove back, and at 6.15 sat down to dine.  It was the Sherryincident over again, the remembrance of which came painfully backto Carrie.  She remembered Mrs. Vance, who had never called againafter Hurstwood's reception, and Ames.
　　At this figure her mind halted.  It was a strong, clean vision.He liked better books than she read, better people than sheassociated with.  His ideals burned in her heart.
　　"It's fine to be a good actress," came distinctly back.
　　What sort of an actress was she?
　　"What are you thinking about, Miss Madenda?" inquired her merrycompanion.  "Come, now, let's see if I can guess."
　　"Oh, no," said Carrie.  "Don't try."
　　She shook it off and ate.  She forgot, in part, and was merry.When it came to the after-theatre proposition, however, she shookher head.
　　"No," she said, "I can't.  I have a previous engagement."
　　"Oh, now, Miss Madenda," pleaded the youth.
　　"No," said Carrie, "I can't.  You've been so kind, but you'llhave to excuse me."
　　The youth looked exceedingly crestfallen.
　　"Cheer up, old man," whispered his companion.  "We'll go around,anyhow.  She may change her mind."
　　Chapter XL
　　A PUBLIC DISSENSION--A FINAL APPEAL
　　There was no after-theatre lark, however, so far as Carrie wasconcerned.  She made her way homeward, thinking about herabsence.  Hurstwood was asleep, but roused up to look as shepassed through to her own bed.
　　"Is that you?" he said.
　　"Yes," she answered.
　　The next morning at breakfast she felt like apologising.
　　"I couldn't get home last evening," she said.
　　"Ah, Carrie," he answered, "what's the use saying that? I don'tcare.  You needn't tell me that, though."
　　"I couldn't," said Carrie, her colour rising.  Then, seeing thathe looked as if he said "I know," she exclaimed: "Oh, all right.I don't care."
　　From now on, her indifference to the flat was even greater.There seemed no common ground on which they could talk to oneanother.  She let herself be asked for expenses.  It became sowith him that he hated to do it.  He preferred standing off thebutcher and baker.  He ran up a grocery bill of sixteen dollarswith Oeslogge, laying in a supply of staple articles, so thatthey would not have to buy any of those things for some time tocome.  Then he changed his grocery.  It was the same with thebutcher and several others.  Carrie never heard anything of thisdirectly from him.He asked for such as he could expect, drifting farther andfarther into a situation which could have but one ending.
　　In this fashion, September went by.
　　"Isn't Mr. Drake going to open his hotel?" Carrie asked severaltimes.
　　"Yes.  He won't do it before October, though, now."
　　Carrie became disgusted.  "Such a man," she said to herselffrequently.  More and more she visited.  She put most of herspare money in clothes, which, after all, was not an astonishingamount.  At last the opera she was with announced its departurewithin four weeks.  "Last two weeks of the Great Comic Operasuccess ----The--------," etc., was upon all billboards and inthe newspapers, before she acted.
　　"I'm not going out on the road," said Miss Osborne.
　　Carrie went with her to apply to another manager.
　　"Ever had any experience?" was one of his questions.
　　"I'm with the company at the Casino now."
　　"Oh, you are?" he said.
　　The end of this was another engagement at twenty per week.
　　Carrie was delighted.  She began to feel that she had a place inthe world.  People recognised ability.
　　So changed was her state that the home atmosphere becameintolerable.  It was all poverty and trouble there, or seemed tobe, because it was a load to bear.  It became a place to keepaway from.  Still she slept there, and did a fair amount of work,keeping it in order.  It was a sitting place for Hurstwood.  Hesat and rocked, rocked and read, enveloped in the gloom of hisown fate.  October went by, and November.  It was the dead ofwinter almost before he knew it, and there he sat.
　　Carrie was doing better, that he knew.  Her clothes were improvednow, even fine.  He saw her coming and going, sometimes picturingto himself her rise.  Little eating had thinned him somewhat.  Hehad no appetite.  His clothes, too, were a poor man's clothes.Talk about getting something had become even too threadbare andridiculous for him.  So he folded his hands and waited--for what,he could not anticipate.
　　At last, however, troubles became too thick.  The hounding ofcreditors, the indifference of Carrie, the silence of the flat,and presence of winter, all joined to produce a climax.  It waseffected by the arrival of Oeslogge, personally, when Carrie wasthere.
　　"I call about my bill," said Mr. Oeslogge.
　　Carrie was only faintly surprised.
　　"How much is it?" she asked.
　　"Sixteen dollars," he replied.
　　"Oh, that much?" said Carrie.  "Is this right?" she asked,turning to Hurstwood.
　　"Yes," he said.
　　"Well, I never heard anything about it."
　　She looked as if she thought he had been contracting someneedless expense.
　　"Well, we had it all right," he answered.  Then he went to thedoor.  "I can't pay you anything on that to-day," he said,mildly.
　　"Well, when can you?" said the grocer.
　　"Not before Saturday, anyhow," said Hurstwood.
　　"Huh!" returned the grocer.  "This is fine.  I must have that.  Ineed the money."
　　Carrie was standing farther back in the room, hearing it all.She was greatly distressed.  It was so bad and commonplace.Hurstwood was annoyed also.
　　"Well," he said, "there's no use talking about it now.  If you'llcome in Saturday, I'll pay you something on it."
　　The grocery man went away.
　　"How are we going to pay it?" asked Carrie, astonished by thebill.  "I can't do it."
　　"Well, you don't have to," he said.  "He can't get what he can'tget.  He'll have to wait."
　　"I don't see how we ran up such a bill as that," said Carrie.
　　"Well, we ate it," said Hurstwood.
　　"It's funny," she replied, still doubting.
　　"What's the use of your standing there and talking like that,now?" he asked.  "Do you think I've had it alone? You talk as ifI'd taken something."
　　"Well, it's too much, anyhow," said Carrie.  "I oughtn't to bemade to pay for it.  I've got more than I can pay for now."
　　"All right," replied Hurstwood, sitting down in silence.  He wassick of the grind of this thing.
　　Carrie went out and there he sat, determining to do something.
　　There had been appearing in the papers about this time rumoursand notices of an approaching strike on the trolley lines inBrooklyn.  There was general dissatisfaction as to the hours oflabour required and the wages paid.  As usual--and for someinexplicable reason--the men chose the winter for the forcing ofthe hand of their employers and the settlement of theirdifficulties.
　　Hurstwood had been reading of this thing, and wonderingconcerning the huge tie-up which would follow.  A day or twobefore this trouble with Carrie, it came.  On a cold afternoon,when everything was grey and it threatened to snow, the papersannounced that the men had been called out on all the lines.Being so utterly idle, and his mind filled with the numerouspredictions which had been made concerning the scarcity of labourthis winter and the panicky state of the financial market,Hurstwood read this with interest.  He noted the claims of thestriking motormen and conductors, who said that they had beenwont to receive two dollars a day in times past, but that for ayear or more "trippers" had been introduced, which cut down theirchance of livelihood one-half, and increased their hours ofservitude from ten to twelve, and even fourteen.  These"trippers" were men put on during the busy and rush hours, totake a car out for one trip.  The compensation paid for such atrip was only twenty-five cents.  When the rush or busy hourswere over, they were laid off.  Worst of all, no man might knowwhen he was going to get a car.  He must come to the barns in themorning and wait around in fair and foul weather until such timeas he was needed.  Two trips were an average reward for so muchwaiting--a little over three hours' work for fifty cents.  Thework of waiting was not counted.
　　The men complained that this system was extending, and that thetime was not far off when but a few out of 7,000 employees wouldhave regular two-dollar-a-day work at all.  They demanded thatthe system be abolished, and that ten hours be considered a day'swork, barring unavoidable delays, with $2.25 pay.  They demandedimmediate acceptance of these terms, which the various trolleycompanies refused.
　　Hurstwood at first sympathised with the demands of these men--indeed, it is a question whether he did not always sympathisewith them to the end, belie him as his actions might.  Readingnearly all the news, he was attracted first by the scare-headswith which the trouble was noted in the "World." He read itfully--the names of the seven companies involved, the number ofmen.
　　"They're foolish to strike in this sort of weather," he thoughtto himself.  "Let 'em win if they can, though."
　　The next day there was even a larger notice of it.  "BrooklynitesWalk," said the "World." "Knights of Labour Tie up the TrolleyLines Across the Bridge." "About Seven Thousand Men Out."
　　Hurstwood read this, formulating to himself his own idea of whatwould be the outcome.  He was a great believer in the strength ofcorporations.
　　"They can't win," he said, concerning the men.  "They haven't anymoney.  The police will protect the companies.  They've got to.The public has to have its cars."
　　He didn't sympathise with the corporations, but strength was withthem.  So was property and public utility.
　　"Those fellows can't win," he thought.
　　Among other things, he noticed a circular issued by one of thecompanies, which read:
　　ATLANTIC AVENUE RAILROAD
　　SPECIAL NOTICE
　　The motormen and conductors and other employees of this companyhaving abruptly left its service, an opportunity is now given toall loyal men who have struck against their will to bereinstated, providing they will make their applications by twelveo'clock noon on Wednesday, January 16th.  Such men will be givenemployment (with guaranteed protection) in the order in whichsuch applications are received, and runs and positions assignedthem accordingly.  Otherwise, they will be considered discharged,and every vacancy will be filled by a new man as soon as hisservices can be secured.(Signed)Benjamin Norton,President
　　He also noted among the want ads.  one which read:
　　WANTED.--50 skilled motormen, accustomed to Westinghouse system,to run U.S. mail cars only, in the City of Brooklyn; protectionguaranteed.
　　He noted particularly in each the "protection guaranteed." Itsignified to him the unassailable power of the companies.
　　"They've got the militia on their side," he thought.  "Thereisn't anything those men can do."
　　While this was still in his mind, the incident with Oeslogge andCarrie occurred.  There had been a good deal to irritate him, butthis seemed much the worst.  Never before had she accused him ofstealing--or very near that.  She doubted the naturalness of solarge a bill.  And he had worked so hard to make expenses seemlight.  He had been "doing" butcher and baker in order not tocall on her.  He had eaten very little--almost nothing.
　　"Damn it all!" he said.  "I can get something.  I'm not downyet."
　　He thought that he really must do something now.  It was toocheap to sit around after such an insinuation as this.  Why,after a little, he would be standing anything.
　　He got up and looked out the window into the chilly street.  Itcame gradually into his mind, as he stood there, to go toBrooklyn.
　　"Why not?" his mind said.  "Any one can get work over there.You'll get two a day."
　　"How about accidents?" said a voice.  "You might get hurt."
　　"Oh, there won't be much of that," he answered.  "They've calledout the police.  Any one who wants to run a car will be protectedall right."
　　"You don't know how to run a car," rejoined the voice.
　　"I won't apply as a motorman," he answered.  "I can ring up faresall right."
　　"They'll want motormen, mostly."
　　"They'll take anybody; that I know."
　　For several hours he argued pro and con with this mentalcounsellor, feeling no need to act at once in a matter so sure ofprofit.
　　In the morning he put on his best clothes, which were poorenough, and began stirring about, putting some bread and meatinto a page of a newspaper.  Carrie watched him, interested inthis new move.
　　"Where are you going?" she asked.
　　"Over to Brooklyn," he answered.  Then, seeing her stillinquisitive, he added: "I think I can get on over there."
　　"On the trolley lines?" said Carrie, astonished.
　　"Yes," he rejoined.
　　"Aren't you afraid?" she asked.
　　"What of?" he answered.  "The police are protecting them."
　　"The paper said four men were hurt yesterday."
　　"Yes," he returned; "but you can't go by what the papers say.They'll run the cars all right."
　　He looked rather determined now, in a desolate sort of way, andCarrie felt very sorry.  Something of the old Hurstwood was here--the least shadow of what was once shrewd and pleasant strength.Outside, it was cloudy and blowing a few flakes of snow.
　　"What a day to go over there," thought Carrie.
　　Now he left before she did, which was a remarkable thing, andtramped eastward to Fourteenth Street and Sixth Avenue, where hetook the car.  He had read that scores of applicants wereapplying at the office of the Brooklyn City Railroad building andwere being received.  He made his way there by horse-car andferry--a dark, silent man--to the offices in question.  It was along way, for no cars were running, and the day was cold; but hetrudged along grimly.  Once in Brooklyn, he could clearly see andfeel that a strike was on.  People showed it in their manner.Along the routes of certain tracks not a car was running.  Aboutcertain corners and nearby saloons small groups of men werelounging.  Several spring wagons passed him, equipped with plainwooden chairs, and labelled "Flatbush" or "Prospect Park.  Fare,Ten Cents." He noticed cold and even gloomy faces.  Labour washaving its little war.
　　When he came near the office in question, he saw a few menstanding about, and some policemen.  On the far corners wereother men--whom he took to be strikers--watching.  All the houseswere small and wooden, the streets poorly paved.  After New York,Brooklyn looked actually poor and hard-up.
　　He made his way into the heart of the small group, eyed bypolicemen and the men already there.  One of the officersaddressed him.
　　"What are you looking for?"
　　"I want to see if I can get a place."
　　"The offices are up those steps," said the bluecoat.  His facewas a very neutral thing to contemplate.  In his heart of hearts,he sympathised with the strikers and hated this "scab." In hisheart of hearts, also, he felt the dignity and use of the policeforce, which commanded order.  Of its true social significance,he never once dreamed.  His was not the mind for that.  The twofeelings blended in him--neutralised one another and him.  Hewould have fought for this man as determinedly as for himself,and yet only so far as commanded.  Strip him of his uniform, andhe would have soon picked his side.
　　Hurstwood ascended a dusty flight of steps and entered a small,dust-coloured office, in which were a railing, a long desk, andseveral clerks.
　　"Well, sir?" said a middle-aged man, looking up at him from thelong desk.
　　"Do you want to hire any men?" inquired Hurstwood.
　　"What are you--a motorman?"
　　"No; I'm not anything," said Hurstwood.
　　He was not at all abashed by his position.  He knew these peopleneeded men.  If one didn't take him, another would.  This mancould take him or leave him, just as he chose.
　　"Well, we prefer experienced men, of course," said the man.  Hepaused, while Hurstwood smiled indifferently.  Then he added:"Still, I guess you can learn.  What is your name?"
　　"Wheeler," said Hurstwood.
　　The man wrote an order on a small card.  "Take that to ourbarns," he said, "and give it to the foreman.  He'll show youwhat to do."
　　Hurstwood went down and out.  He walked straight away in thedirection indicated, while the policemen looked after.
　　"There's another wants to try it," said Officer Kiely to OfficerMacey.
　　"I have my mind he'll get his fill," returned the latter,quietly.  They had been in strikes before.
　　Chapter XLI
　　THE STRIKE
　　The barn at which Hurstwood applied was exceedingly short-handed,and was being operated practically by three men as directors.There were a lot of green hands around--queer, hungry-lookingmen, who looked as if want had driven them to desperate means.They tried to be lively and willing, but there was an air ofhang-dog diffidence about the place.
　　Hurstwood went back through the barns and out into a large,enclosed lot, where were a series of tracks and loops.  A half-dozen cars were there, manned by instructors, each with a pupilat the lever.  More pupils were waiting at one of the rear doorsof the barn.
　　In silence Hurstwood viewed this scene, and waited.  Hiscompanions took his eye for a while, though they did not interesthim much more than the cars.  They were an uncomfortable-lookinggang, however.  One or two were very thin and lean.  Several werequite stout.  Several others were rawboned and sallow, as if theyhad been beaten upon by all sorts of rough weather.
　　"Did you see by the paper they are going to call out themilitia?" Hurstwood heard one of them remark.
　　"Oh, they'll do that," returned the other.  "They always do."
　　"Think we're liable to have much trouble?" said another, whomHurstwood did not see.
　　"Not very."
　　"That Scotchman that went out on the last car," put in a voice,"told me that they hit him in the ear with a cinder."
　　A small, nervous laugh accompanied this.
　　"One of those fellows on the Fifth Avenue line must have had ahell of a time, according to the papers," drawled another.  "Theybroke his car windows and pulled him off into the street 'forethe police could stop 'em."
　　"Yes; but there are more police around to-day," was added byanother.
　　Hurstwood hearkened without much mental comment.  These talkersseemed scared to him.  Their gabbling was feverish--things saidto quiet their own minds.  He looked out into the yard andwaited.
　　Two of the men got around quite near him, but behind his back.They were rather social, and he listened to what they said.
　　"Are you a railroad man?" said one.
　　"Me? No.  I've always worked in a paper factory."
　　"I had a job in Newark until last October," returned the other,with reciprocal feeling.
　　There were some words which passed too low to hear.  Then theconversation became strong again.
　　"I don't blame these fellers for striking," said one.  "They'vegot the right of it, all right, but I had to get something todo."
　　"Same here," said the other.  "If I had any job in Newark Iwouldn't be over here takin' chances like these."
　　"It's hell these days, ain't it?" said the man.  "A poor manain't nowhere.  You could starve, by God, right in the streets,and there ain't most no one would help you."
　　"Right you are," said the other.  "The job I had I lost 'causethey shut down.  They run all summer and lay up a big stock, andthen shut down."
　　Hurstwood paid some little attention to this.  Somehow, he felt alittle superior to these two--a little better off.  To him thesewere ignorant and commonplace, poor sheep in a driver's hand.
　　"Poor devils," he thought, speaking out of the thoughts andfeelings of a bygone period of success."Next," said one of the instructors.
　　"You're next," said a neighbour, touching him.
　　He went out and climbed on the platform.  The instructor took itfor granted that no preliminaries were needed.
　　"You see this handle," he said, reaching up to an electric cut-off, which was fastened to the roof.  "This throws the currentoff or on.  If you want to reverse the car you turn it over here.If you want to send it forward, you put it over here.  If youwant to cut off the power, you keep it in the middle."
　　Hurstwood smiled at the simple information.
　　"Now, this handle here regulates your speed.  To here," he said,pointing with his finger, "gives you about four miles an hour.This is eight.  When it's full on, you make about fourteen milesan hour."
　　Hurstwood watched him calmly.  He had seen motormen work before.He knew just about how they did it, and was sure he could do aswell, with a very little practice.
　　The instructor explained a few more details, and then said:
　　"Now, we'll back her up."
　　Hurstwood stood placidly by, while the car rolled back into theyard.
　　"One thing you want to be careful about, and that is to starteasy.  Give one degree time to act before you start another.  Theone fault of most men is that they always want to throw her wideopen.  That's bad.  It's dangerous, too.  Wears out the motor.You don't want to do that."
　　"I see," said Hurstwood.
　　He waited and waited, while the man talked on.
　　"Now you take it," he said, finally.
　　The ex-manager laid hand to the lever and pushed it gently, as hethought.  It worked much easier than he imagined, however, withthe result that the car jerked quickly forward, throwing him backagainst the door.  He straightened up sheepishly, while theinstructor stopped the car with the brake.
　　"You want to be careful about that," was all he said.
　　Hurstwood found, however, that handling a brake and regulatingspeed were not so instantly mastered as he had imagined.  Once ortwice he would have ploughed through the rear fence if it had notbeen for the hand and word of his companion.  The latter wasrather patient with him, but he never smiled.
　　"You've got to get the knack of working both arms at once," hesaid.  "It takes a little practice."
　　One o'clock came while he was still on the car practising, and hebegan to feel hungry.  The day set in snowing, and he was cold.He grew weary of running to and fro on the short track.
　　They ran the car to the end and both got off.  Hurstwood wentinto the barn and sought a car step, pulling out his paper-wrapped lunch from his pocket.  There was no water and the breadwas dry, but he enjoyed it.  There was no ceremony about dining.He swallowed and looked about, contemplating the dull, homelylabour of the thing.  It was disagreeable--miserablydisagreeable--in all its phases.  Not because it was bitter, butbecause it was hard.  It would be hard to any one, he thought.
　　After eating, he stood about as before, waiting until his turncame.
　　The intention was to give him an afternoon of practice, but thegreater part of the time was spent in waiting about.
　　At last evening came, and with it hunger and a debate withhimself as to how he should spend the night.  It was half-pastfive.  He must soon eat.  If he tried to go home, it would takehim two hours and a half of cold walking and riding.  Besides hehad orders to report at seven the next morning, and going homewould necessitate his rising at an unholy and disagreeable hour.He had only something like a dollar and fifteen cents of Carrie'smoney, with which he had intended to pay the two weeks' coal billbefore the present idea struck him.
　　"They must have some place around here," he thought.  "Where doesthat fellow from Newark stay?"
　　Finally he decided to ask.  There was a young fellow standingnear one of the doors in the cold, waiting a last turn.  He was amere boy in years--twenty-one about--but with a body lank andlong, because of privation.  A little good living would have madethis youth plump and swaggering.
　　"How do they arrange this, if a man hasn't any money?" inquiredHurstwood, discreetly.
　　The fellow turned a keen, watchful face on the inquirer.
　　"You mean eat?" he replied.
　　"Yes, and sleep.  I can't go back to New York to-night."
　　"The foreman 'll fix that if you ask him, I guess.  He did me."
　　"That so?"
　　"Yes.  I just told him I didn't have anything.  Gee, I couldn'tgo home.  I live way over in Hoboken."
　　Hurstwood only cleared his throat by way of acknowledgment.
　　"They've got a place upstairs here, I understand.  I don't knowwhat sort of a thing it is.  Purty tough, I guess.  He gave me ameal ticket this noon.  I know that wasn't much."
　　Hurstwood smiled grimly, and the boy laughed.
　　"It ain't no fun, is it?" he inquired, wishing vainly for acheery reply.
　　"Not much," answered Hurstwood.
　　"I'd tackle him now," volunteered the youth.  "He may go 'way."
　　Hurstwood did so.
　　"Isn't there some place I can stay around here to-night?" heinquired.  "If I have to go back to New York, I'm afraid I won't"
　　"There're some cots upstairs," interrupted the man, "if you wantone of them."
　　"That'll do," he assented.
　　He meant to ask for a meal ticket, but the seemingly propermoment never came, and he decided to pay himself that night.
　　"I'll ask him in the morning."
　　He ate in a cheap restaurant in the vicinity, and, being cold andlonely, went straight off to seek the loft in question.  Thecompany was not attempting to run cars after nightfall.  It wasso advised by the police.
　　The room seemed to have been a lounging place for night workers.There were some nine cots in the place, two or three woodenchairs, a soap box, and a small, round-bellied stove, in which afire was blazing.  Early as he was, another man was there beforehim.  The latter was sitting beside the stove warming his hands.
　　Hurstwood approached and held out his own toward the fire.  Hewas sick of the bareness and privation of all things connectedwith his venture, but was steeling himself to hold out.  Hefancied he could for a while.
　　"Cold, isn't it?" said the early guest.
　　"Rather."
　　A long silence.
　　"Not much of a place to sleep in, is it?" said the man.
　　"Better than nothing," replied Hurstwood.
　　Another silence.
　　"I believe I'll turn in," said the man.
　　Rising, he went to one of the cots and stretched himself,removing only his shoes, and pulling the one blanket and dirtyold comforter over him in a sort of bundle.  The sight disgustedHurstwood, but he did not dwell on it, choosing to gaze into thestove and think of something else.  Presently he decided toretire, and picked a cot, also removing his shoes.
　　While he was doing so, the youth who had advised him to come hereentered, and, seeing Hurstwood, tried to be genial.
　　"Better'n nothin'," he observed, looking around.
　　Hurstwood did not take this to himself.  He thought it to be anexpression of individual satisfaction, and so did not answer.The youth imagined he was out of sorts, and set to whistlingsoftly.  Seeing another man asleep, he quit that and lapsed intosilence.
　　Hurstwood made the best of a bad lot by keeping on his clothesand pushing away the dirty covering from his head, but at last hedozed in sheer weariness.  The covering became more and morecomfortable, its character was forgotten, and he pulled it abouthis neck and slept.In the morning he was aroused out of a pleasant dream by severalmen stirring about in the cold, cheerless room.  He had been backin Chicago in fancy, in his own comfortable home.  Jessica hadbeen arranging to go somewhere, and he had been talking with herabout it.  This was so clear in his mind, that he was startlednow by the contrast of this room.  He raised his head, and thecold, bitter reality jarred him into wakefulness.
　　"Guess I'd better get up," he said.
　　There was no water on this floor.  He put on his shoes in thecold and stood up, shaking himself in his stiffness.  His clothesfelt disagreeable, his hair bad.
　　"Hell!" he muttered, as he put on his hat.
　　Downstairs things were stirring again.
　　He found a hydrant, with a trough which had once been used forhorses, but there was no towel here, and his handkerchief wassoiled from yesterday.  He contented himself with wetting hiseyes with the ice-cold water.  Then he sought the foreman, whowas already on the ground.
　　"Had your breakfast yet?" inquired that worthy.
　　"No," said Hurstwood.
　　"Better get it, then; your car won't be ready for a littlewhile."
　　Hurstwood hesitated.
　　"Could you let me have a meal ticket?" he asked with an effort.
　　"Here you are," said the man, handing him one.
　　He breakfasted as poorly as the night before on some fried steakand bad coffee.  Then he went back.
　　"Here," said the foreman, motioning him, when he came in.  "Youtake this car out in a few minutes."
　　Hurstwood climbed up on the platform in the gloomy barn andwaited for a signal.  He was nervous, and yet the thing was arelief.  Anything was better than the barn.
　　On this the fourth day of the strike, the situation had taken aturn for the worse.  The strikers, following the counsel of theirleaders and the newspapers, had struggled peaceably enough.There had been no great violence done.  Cars had been stopped, itis true, and the men argued with.  Some crews had been won overand led away, some windows broken, some jeering and yelling done;but in no more than five or six instances had men been seriouslyinjured.  These by crowds whose acts the leaders disclaimed.
　　Idleness, however, and the sight of the company, backed by thepolice, triumphing, angered the men.  They saw that each day morecars were going on, each day more declarations were being made bythe company officials that the effective opposition of thestrikers was broken.  This put desperate thoughts in the minds ofthe men.  Peaceful methods meant, they saw, that the companieswould soon run all their cars and those who had complained wouldbe forgotten.  There was nothing so helpful to the companies aspeaceful methods.All at once they blazed forth, and for a week there was storm andstress.  Cars were assailed, men attacked, policemen struggledwith, tracks torn up, and shots fired, until at last streetfights and mob movements became frequent, and the city wasinvested with militia.
　　Hurstwood knew nothing of the change of temper.
　　"Run your car out," called the foreman, waving a vigorous hand athim.  A green conductor jumped up behind and rang the bell twiceas a signal to start.  Hurstwood turned the lever and ran the carout through the door into the street in front of the barn.  Heretwo brawny policemen got up beside him on the platform--one oneither hand.
　　At the sound of a gong near the barn door, two bells were givenby the conductor and Hurstwood opened his lever.
　　The two policemen looked about them calmly.
　　"'Tis cold, all right, this morning," said the one on the left,who possessed a rich brogue.
　　"I had enough of it yesterday," said the other.  "I wouldn't wanta steady job of this."
　　"Nor I."
　　Neither paid the slightest attention to Hurstwood, who stoodfacing the cold wind, which was chilling him completely, andthinking of his orders.
　　"Keep a steady gait," the foreman had said.  "Don't stop for anyone who doesn't look like a real passenger.  Whatever you do,don't stop for a crowd."
　　The two officers kept silent for a few moments.
　　"The last man must have gone through all right," said the officeron the left.  "I don't see his car anywhere."
　　"Who's on there?" asked the second officer, referring, of course,to its complement of policemen.
　　"Schaeffer and Ryan."
　　There was another silence, in which the car ran smoothly along.There were not so many houses along this part of the way.Hurstwood did not see many people either.  The situation was notwholly disagreeable to him.  If he were not so cold, he thoughthe would do well enough.
　　He was brought out of this feeling by the sudden appearance of acurve ahead, which he had not expected.  He shut off the currentand did an energetic turn at the brake, but not in time to avoidan unnaturally quick turn.  It shook him up and made him feellike making some apologetic remarks, but he refrained.
　　"You want to look out for them things," said the officer on theleft, condescendingly.
　　"That's right," agreed Hurstwood, shamefacedly.
　　"There's lots of them on this line," said the officer on theright.Around the corner a more populated way appeared.  One or twopedestrians were in view ahead.  A boy coming out of a gate witha tin milk bucket gave Hurstwood his first objectionablegreeting.
　　"Scab!" he yelled.  "Scab!"
　　Hurstwood heard it, but tried to make no comment, even tohimself.  He knew he would get that, and much more of the samesort, probably.
　　At a corner farther up a man stood by the track and signalled thecar to stop.
　　"Never mind him," said one of the officers.  "He's up to somegame."
　　Hurstwood obeyed.  At the corner he saw the wisdom of it.  Nosooner did the man perceive the intention to ignore him, than heshook his fist.
　　"Ah, you bloody coward!" he yelled.
　　Some half dozen men, standing on the corner, flung taunts andjeers after the speeding car.
　　Hurstwood winced the least bit.  The real thing was slightlyworse than the thoughts of it had been.
　　Now came in sight, three or four blocks farther on, a heap ofsomething on the track.
　　"They've been at work, here, all right," said one of thepolicemen.
　　"We'll have an argument, maybe," said the other.
　　Hurstwood ran the car close and stopped.  He had not done sowholly, however, before a crowd gathered about.  It was composedof ex-motormen and conductors in part, with a sprinkling offriends and sympathisers.
　　"Come off the car, pardner," said one of the men in a voice meantto be conciliatory.  "You don't want to take the bread out ofanother man's mouth, do you?"
　　Hurstwood held to his brake and lever, pale and very uncertainwhat to do.
　　"Stand back," yelled one of the officers, leaning over theplatform railing.  "Clear out of this, now.  Give the man achance to do his work."
　　"Listen, pardner," said the leader, ignoring the policeman andaddressing Hurstwood.  "We're all working men, like yourself.  Ifyou were a regular motorman, and had been treated as we've been,you wouldn't want any one to come in and take your place, wouldyou? You wouldn't want any one to do you out of your chance toget your rights, would you?"
　　"Shut her off! shut her off!" urged the other of the policemen,roughly.  "Get out of this, now," and he jumped the railing andlanded before the crowd and began shoving.  Instantly the otherofficer was down beside him.
　　"Stand back, now," they yelled.  "Get out of this.  What the helldo you mean? Out, now."
　　It was like a small swarm of bees.
　　"Don't shove me," said one of the strikers, determinedly.  "I'mnot doing anything."
　　"Get out of this!" cried the officer, swinging his club.  "I'llgive ye a bat on the sconce.  Back, now."
　　"What the hell!" cried another of the strikers, pushing the otherway, adding at the same time some lusty oaths.
　　Crack came an officer's club on his forehead.  He blinked hiseyes blindly a few times, wabbled on his legs, threw up hishands, and staggered back.  In return, a swift fist landed on theofficer's neck.
　　Infuriated by this, the latter plunged left and right, layingabout madly with his club.  He was ably assisted by his brotherof the blue, who poured ponderous oaths upon the troubled waters.No severe damage was done, owing to the agility of the strikersin keeping out of reach.  They stood about the sidewalk now andjeered.
　　"Where is the conductor?" yelled one of the officers, getting hiseye on that individual, who had come nervously forward to standby Hurstwood.  The latter had stood gazing upon the scene withmore astonishment than fear.
　　"Why don't you come down here and get these stones off thetrack?" inquired the officer.  "What you standing there for? Doyou want to stay here all day? Get down."
　　Hurstwood breathed heavily in excitement and jumped down with thenervous conductor as if he had been called.
　　"Hurry up, now," said the other policeman.
　　Cold as it was, these officers were hot and mad.  Hurstwoodworked with the conductor, lifting stone after stone and warminghimself by the work.
　　"Ah, you scab, you!" yelled the crowd.  "You coward! Steal aman's job, will you? Rob the poor, will you, you thief? We'll getyou yet, now.  Wait."
　　Not all of this was delivered by one man.  It came from here andthere, incorporated with much more of the same sort and curses.
　　"Work, you blackguards," yelled a voice.  "Do the dirty work.You're the suckers that keep the poor people down!"
　　"May God starve ye yet," yelled an old Irish woman, who now threwopen a nearby window and stuck out her head.
　　"Yes, and you," she added, catching the eye of one of thepolicemen.  "You bloody, murtherin' thafe! Crack my son over thehead, will you, you hardhearted, murtherin' divil? Ah, ye----"
　　But the officer turned a deaf ear.
　　"Go to the devil, you old hag," he half muttered as he staredround upon the scattered company.
　　Now the stones were off, and Hurstwood took his place again amida continued chorus of epithets.  Both officers got up beside himand the conductor rang the bell, when, bang! bang! through windowand door came rocks and stones.  One narrowly grazed Hurstwood'shead.  Another shattered the window behind.
　　"Throw open your lever," yelled one of the officers, grabbing atthe handle himself.
　　Hurstwood complied and the car shot away, followed by a rattle ofstones and a rain of curses.
　　"That --- --- --- ---- hit me in the neck," said one of theofficers.  "I gave him a good crack for it, though."
　　"I think I must have left spots on some of them," said the other.
　　"I know that big guy that called us a --- --- --- ----" said thefirst.  "I'll get him yet for that."
　　"I thought we were in for it sure, once there," said the second.
　　Hurstwood, warmed and excited, gazed steadily ahead.  It was anastonishing experience for him.  He had read of these things, butthe reality seemed something altogether new.  He was no coward inspirit.  The fact that he had suffered this much now ratheroperated to arouse a stolid determination to stick it out.  Hedid not recur in thought to New York or the flat.  This one tripseemed a consuming thing.
　　They now ran into the business heart of Brooklyn uninterrupted.People gazed at the broken windows of the car and at Hurstwood inhis plain clothes.  Voices called "scab" now and then, as well asother epithets, but no crowd attacked the car.  At the downtownend of the line, one of the officers went to call up his stationand report the trouble.
　　"There's a gang out there," he said, "laying for us yet.  Bettersend some one over there and clean them out."
　　The car ran back more quietly--hooted, watched, flung at, but notattacked.  Hurstwood breathed freely when he saw the barns.
　　"Well," he observed to himself, "I came out of that all right."
　　The car was turned in and he was allowed to loaf a while, butlater he was again called.  This time a new team of officers wasaboard.  Slightly more confident, he sped the car along thecommonplace streets and felt somewhat less fearful.  On one side,however, he suffered intensely.  The day was raw, with asprinkling of snow and a gusty wind, made all the moreintolerable by the speed of the car.  His clothing was notintended for this sort of work.  He shivered, stamped his feet,and beat his arms as he had seen other motormen do in the past,but said nothing.  The novelty and danger of the situationmodified in a way his disgust and distress at being compelled tobe here, but not enough to prevent him from feeling grim andsour.  This was a dog's life, he thought.  It was a tough thingto have to come to.
　　The one thought that strengthened him was the insult offered byCarrie.  He was not down so low as to take all that, he thought.He could do something--this, even--for a while.  It would getbetter.  He would save a little.
　　A boy threw a clod of mud while he was thus reflecting and hithim upon the arm.  It hurt sharply and angered him more than hehad been any time since morning.
　　"The little cur!" he muttered.
　　"Hurt you?" asked one of the policemen.
　　"No," he answered.
　　At one of the corners, where the car slowed up because of a turn,an ex-motorman, standing on the sidewalk, called to him:
　　"Won't you come out, pardner, and be a man? Remember we'refighting for decent day's wages, that's all.  We've got familiesto support." The man seemed most peaceably inclined.
　　Hurstwood pretended not to see him.  He kept his eyes straight onbefore and opened the lever wide.  The voice had somethingappealing in it.
　　All morning this went on and long into the afternoon.  He madethree such trips.  The dinner he had was no stay for such workand the cold was telling on him.  At each end of the line hestopped to thaw out, but he could have groaned at the anguish ofit.  One of the barnmen, out of pity, loaned him a heavy cap anda pair of sheepskin gloves, and for once he was extremelythankful.
　　On the second trip of the afternoon he ran into a crowd abouthalf way along the line, that had blocked the car's progress withan old telegraph pole.
　　"Get that thing off the track," shouted the two policemen.
　　"Yah, yah, yah!" yelled the crowd.  "Get it off yourself."
　　The two policemen got down and Hurstwood started to follow.
　　"You stay there," one called.  "Some one will run away with yourcar."
　　Amid the babel of voices, Hurstwood heard one close beside him.
　　"Come down, pardner, and be a man.  Don't fight the poor.  Leavethat to the corporations."
　　He saw the same fellow who had called to him from the corner.Now, as before, he pretended not to hear him.
　　"Come down," the man repeated gently.  "You don't want to fightpoor men.  Don't fight at all." It was a most philosophic andjesuitical motorman.
　　A third policeman joined the other two from somewhere and someone ran to telephone for more officers.  Hurstwood gazed about,determined but fearful.
　　A man grabbed him by the coat.
　　"Come off of that," he exclaimed, jerking at him and trying topull him over the railing.
　　"Let go," said Hurstwood, savagely.
　　"I'll show you--you scab!" cried a young Irishman, jumping up onthe car and aiming a blow at Hurstwood.  The latter ducked andcaught it on the shoulder instead of the jaw.
　　"Away from here," shouted an officer, hastening to the rescue,and adding, of course, the usual oaths.
　　Hurstwood recovered himself, pale and trembling.  It was becomingserious with him now.  People were looking up and jeering at him.One girl was making faces.
　　He began to waver in his resolution, when a patrol wagon rolledup and more officers dismounted.  Now the track was quicklycleared and the release effected.
　　"Let her go now, quick," said the officer, and again he was off.
　　The end came with a real mob, which met the car on its returntrip a mile or two from the barns.  It was an exceedingly poor-looking neighbourhood.  He wanted to run fast through it, butagain the track was blocked.  He saw men carrying something outto it when he was yet a half-dozen blocks away.
　　"There they are again!" exclaimed one policeman.
　　"I'll give them something this time," said the second officer,whose patience was becoming worn.  Hurstwood suffered a qualm ofbody as the car rolled up.  As before, the crowd began hooting,but now, rather than come near, they threw things.  One or twowindows were smashed and Hurstwood dodged a stone.
　　Both policemen ran out toward the crowd, but the latter repliedby running toward the car.  A woman--a mere girl in appearance--was among these, bearing a rough stick.  She was exceedinglywrathful and struck at Hurstwood, who dodged.  Thereupon, hercompanions, duly encouraged, jumped on the car and pulledHurstwood over.  He had hardly time to speak or shout before hefell.
　　"Let go of me," he said, falling on his side.
　　"Ah, you sucker," he heard some one say.  Kicks and blows rainedon him.  He seemed to be suffocating.  Then two men seemed to bedragging him off and he wrestled for freedom.
　　"Let up," said a voice, "you're all right.  Stand up."
　　He was let loose and recovered himself.  Now he recognised twoofficers.  He felt as if he would faint from exhaustion.Something was wet on his chin.  He put up his hand and felt, thenlooked.  It was red.
　　"They cut me," he said, foolishly, fishing for his handkerchief.
　　"Now, now," said one of the officers.  "It's only a scratch."
　　His senses became cleared now and he looked around.  He wasstanding in a little store, where they left him for the moment.Outside, he could see, as he stood wiping his chin, the car andthe excited crowd.  A patrol wagon was there, and another.
　　He walked over and looked out.  It was an ambulance, backing in.
　　He saw some energetic charging by the police and arrests beingmade.
　　"Come on, now, if you want to take your car," said an officer,opening the door and looking in.He walked out, feeling rather uncertain of himself.  He was verycold and frightened.
　　"Where's the conductor?" he asked.
　　"Oh, he's not here now," said the policeman.
　　Hurstwood went toward the car and stepped nervously on.  As hedid so there was a pistol shot.  Something stung his shoulder.
　　"Who fired that?" he heard an officer exclaim.  "By God! who didthat?" Both left him, running toward a certain building.  Hepaused a moment and then got down.
　　"George!" exclaimed Hurstwood, weakly, "this is too much for me."
　　He walked nervously to the corner and hurried down a side street.
　　"Whew!" he said, drawing in his breath.
　　A half block away, a small girl gazed at him.
　　"You'd better sneak," she called.
　　He walked homeward in a blinding snowstorm, reaching the ferry bydusk.  The cabins were filled with comfortable souls, who studiedhim curiously.  His head was still in such a whirl that he feltconfused.  All the wonder of the twinkling lights of the river ina white storm passed for nothing.  He trudged doggedly on untilhe reached the flat.  There he entered and found the room warm.Carrie was gone.  A couple of evening papers were lying on thetable where she left them.  He lit the gas and sat down.  Then hegot up and stripped to examine his shoulder.  It was a merescratch.  He washed his hands and face, still in a brown study,apparently, and combed his hair.  Then he looked for something toeat, and finally, his hunger gone, sat down in his comfortablerocking-chair.  It was a wonderful relief.
　　He put his hand to his chin, forgetting, for the moment, thepapers.
　　"Well," he said, after a time, his nature recovering itself,"that's a pretty tough game over there."
　　Then he turned and saw the papers.  With half a sigh he picked upthe "World."
　　"Strike Spreading in Brooklyn," he read.  "Rioting Breaks Out inall Parts of the City."
　　He adjusted his paper very comfortably and continued.  It was theone thing he read with absorbing interest.
　　Chapter XLII
　　A TOUCH OF SPRING--THE EMPTY SHELL
　　Those who look upon Hurstwood's Brooklyn venture as an error ofjudgment will none the less realise the negative influence on himof the fact that he had tried and failed.  Carrie got a wrongidea of it.  He said so little that she imagined he hadencountered nothing worse than the ordinary roughness--quittingso soon in the face of this seemed trifling.  He did not want towork.
　　She was now one of a group of oriental beauties who, in thesecond act of the comic opera, were paraded by the vizier beforethe new potentate as the treasures of his harem.  There was noword assigned to any of them, but on the evening when Hurstwoodwas housing himself in the loft of the street-car barn, theleading comedian and star, feeling exceedingly facetious, said ina profound voice, which created a ripple of laughter:
　　"Well, who are you?"
　　It merely happened to be Carrie who was courtesying before him.It might as well have been any of the others, so far as he wasconcerned.  He expected no answer and a dull one would have beenreproved.  But Carrie, whose experience and belief in herselfgave her daring, courtesied sweetly again and answered:
　　"I am yours truly."
　　It was a trivial thing to say, and yet something in the way shedid it caught the audience, which laughed heartily at the mock-fierce potentate towering before the young woman.  The comedianalso liked it, hearing the laughter.
　　"I thought your name was Smith," he returned, endeavouring to getthe last laugh.
　　Carrie almost trembled for her daring after she had said this.All members of the company had been warned that to interpolatelines or "business" meant a fine or worse.  She did not know whatto think.
　　As she was standing in her proper position in the wings, awaitinganother entry, the great comedian made his exit past her andpaused in recognition.
　　"You can just leave that in hereafter," he remarked, seeing howintelligent she appeared.  "Don't add any more, though."
　　"Thank you," said Carrie, humbly.  When he went on she foundherself trembling violently.
　　"Well, you're in luck," remarked another member of the chorus."There isn't another one of us has got a line."
　　There was no gainsaying the value of this.  Everybody in thecompany realised that she had got a start.  Carrie hugged herselfwhen next evening the lines got the same applause.  She went homerejoicing, knowing that soon something must come of it.  It wasHurstwood who, by his presence, caused her merry thoughts to fleeand replaced them with sharp longings for an end of distress.
　　The next day she asked him about his venture.
　　"They're not trying to run any cars except with police.  Theydon't want anybody just now--not before next week."
　　Next week came, but Carrie saw no change.  Hurstwood seemed moreapathetic than ever.  He saw her off mornings to rehearsals andthe like with the utmost calm.  He read and read.  Several timeshe found himself staring at an item, but thinking of somethingelse.  The first of these lapses that he sharply noticedconcerned a hilarious party he had once attended at a drivingclub, of which he had been a member.  He sat, gazing downward,and gradually thought he heard the old voices and the clink ofglasses.
　　"You're a dandy, Hurstwood," his friend Walker said.  He wasstanding again well dressed, smiling, good-natured, the recipientof encores for a good story.
　　All at once he looked up.  The room was so still it seemedghostlike.  He heard the clock ticking audibly and half suspectedthat he had been dozing.  The paper was so straight in his hands,however, and the items he had been reading so directly beforehim, that he rid himself of the doze idea.  Still, it seemedpeculiar.  When it occurred a second time, however, it did notseem quite so strange.
　　Butcher and grocery man, baker and coal man--not the group withwhom he was then dealing, but those who had trusted him to thelimit--called.  He met them all blandly, becoming deft in excuse.At last he became bold, pretended to be out, or waved them off.
　　"They can't get blood out of a turnip," he said.  "if I had itI'd pay them."
　　Carrie's little soldier friend, Miss Osborne, seeing hersucceeding, had become a sort of satellite.  Little Osborne couldnever of herself amount to anything.  She seemed to realise it ina sort of pussy-like way and instinctively concluded to clingwith her soft little claws to Carrie.
　　"Oh, you'll get up," she kept telling Carrie with admiration."You're so good."
　　Timid as Carrie was, she was strong in capability.  The relianceof others made her feel as if she must, and when she must shedared.  Experience of the world and of necessity was in herfavour.  No longer the lightest word of a man made her headdizzy.  She had learned that men could change and fail.  Flatteryin its most palpable form had lost its force with her.  Itrequired superiority--kindly superiority--to move her--thesuperiority of a genius like Ames.
　　"I don't like the actors in our company," she told Lola one day."They're all so struck on themselves."
　　"Don't you think Mr. Barclay's pretty nice?" inquired Lola, whohad received a condescending smile or two from that quarter.
　　"Oh, he's nice enough," answered Carrie; "but he isn't sincere.He assumes such an air."
　　Lola felt for her first hold upon Carrie in the following manner:
　　"Are you paying room-rent where you are?"
　　"Certainly," answered Carrie.  "Why?"
　　"I know where I could get the loveliest room and bath, cheap.It's too big for me, but it would be just right for two, and therent is only six dollars a week for both."
　　"Where?" said Carrie.
　　"In Seventeenth Street."
　　"Well, I don't know as I'd care to change," said Carrie, who wasalready turning over the three-dollar rate in her mind.  She wasthinking if she had only herself to support this would leave herseventeen for herself.
　　Nothing came of this until after the Brooklyn adventure ofHurstwood's and her success with the speaking part.  Then shebegan to feel as if she must be free.  She thought of leavingHurstwood and thus making him act for himself, but he haddeveloped such peculiar traits she feared he might resist anyeffort to throw him off.  He might hunt her out at the show andhound her in that way.  She did not wholly believe that he would,but he might.  This, she knew, would be an embarrassing thing ifhe made himself conspicuous in any way.  It troubled her greatly.
　　Things were precipitated by the offer of a better part.  One ofthe actresses playing the part of a modest sweetheart gave noticeof leaving and Carrie was selected.
　　"How much are you going to get?" asked Miss Osborne, on hearingthe good news.
　　"I didn't ask him," said Carrie.
　　"Well, find out.  Goodness, you'll never get anything if youdon't ask.  Tell them you must have forty dollars, anyhow."
　　"Oh, no," said Carrie.
　　"Certainly!" exclaimed Lola.  "Ask 'em, anyway."
　　Carrie succumbed to this prompting, waiting, however, until themanager gave her notice of what clothing she must have to fit thepart.
　　"How much do I get?" she inquired.
　　"Thirty-five dollars," he replied.
　　Carrie was too much astonished and delighted to think ofmentioning forty.  She was nearly beside herself, and almosthugged Lola, who clung to her at the news.
　　"It isn't as much as you ought to get," said the latter,"especially when you've got to buy clothes."
　　Carrie remembered this with a start.  Where to get the money? Shehad none laid up for such an emergency.  Rent day was drawingnear.
　　"I'll not do it," she said, remembering her necessity.  "I don'tuse the flat.  I'm not going to give up my money this time.  I'llmove."
　　Fitting into this came another appeal from Miss Osborne, moreurgent than ever.
　　"Come live with me, won't you?" she pleaded.  "We can have theloveliest room.  It won't cost you hardly anything that way."
　　"I'd like to," said Carrie, frankly.
　　"Oh, do," said Lola.  "We'll have such a good time."
　　Carrie thought a while.
　　"I believe I will," she said, and then added: "I'll have to seefirst, though."With the idea thus grounded, rent day approaching, and clothescalling for instant purchase, she soon found excuse inHurstwood's lassitude.  He said less and drooped more than ever.
　　As rent day approached, an idea grew in him.  It was fostered bythe demands of creditors and the impossibility of holding up manymore.  Twenty-eight dollars was too much for rent.  "It's hard onher," he thought.  "We could get a cheaper place."
　　Stirred with this idea, he spoke at the breakfast table.
　　"Don't you think we pay too much rent here?" he asked.
　　"Indeed I do," said Carrie, not catching his drift.
　　"I should think we could get a smaller place," he suggested.  "Wedon't need four rooms."
　　Her countenance, had he been scrutinising her, would haveexhibited the disturbance she felt at this evidence of hisdetermination to stay by her.  He saw nothing remarkable inasking her to come down lower.
　　"Oh, I don't know," she answered, growing wary.
　　"There must be places around here where we could get a couple ofrooms, which would do just as well."
　　Her heart revolted.  "Never!" she thought.  Who would furnish themoney to move? To think of being in two rooms with him! Sheresolved to spend her money for clothes quickly, before somethingterrible happened.  That very day she did it.  Having done so,there was but one other thing to do.
　　"Lola," she said, visiting her friend, "I think I'll come."
　　"Oh, jolly!" cried the latter.
　　"Can we get it right away?" she asked, meaning the room.
　　"Certainly," cried Lola.
　　They went to look at it.  Carrie had saved ten dollars from herexpenditures--enough for this and her board beside.  Her enlargedsalary would not begin for ten days yet--would not reach her forseventeen.  She paid half of the six dollars with her friend.
　　"Now, I've just enough to get on to the end of the week," sheconfided.
　　"Oh, I've got some," said Lola.  "I've got twenty-five dollars,if you need it."
　　"No," said Carrie.  "I guess I'll get along."
　　They decided to move Friday, which was two days away.  Now thatthe thing was settled, Carrie's heart misgave her.  She felt verymuch like a criminal in the matter.  Each day looking atHurstwood, she had realised that, along with the disagreeablenessof his attitude, there was something pathetic.
　　She looked at him the same evening she had made up her mind togo, and now he seemed not so shiftless and worthless, but rundown and beaten upon by chance.  His eyes were not keen, his facemarked, his hands flabby.  She thought his hair had a touch ofgrey.  All unconscious of his doom, he rocked and read his paper,while she glanced at him.
　　Knowing that the end was so near, she became rather solicitous.
　　"Will you go over and get some canned peaches?" she askedHurstwood, laying down a two-dollar bill.
　　"Certainly," he said, looking in wonder at the money.
　　"See if you can get some nice asparagus," she added.  "I'll cookit for dinner."
　　Hurstwood rose and took the money, slipping on his overcoat andgetting his hat.  Carrie noticed that both of these articles ofapparel were old and poor looking in appearance.  It was plainenough before, but now it came home with peculiar force.  Perhapshe couldn't help it, after all.  He had done well in Chicago.She remembered his fine appearance the days he had met her in thepark.  Then he was so sprightly, so clean.  Had it been all hisfault?
　　He came back and laid the change down with the food.
　　"You'd better keep it," she observed.  "We'll need other things."
　　"No," he said, with a sort of pride; "you keep it."
　　"Oh, go on and keep it," she replied, rather unnerved.  "There'llbe other things."
　　He wondered at this, not knowing the pathetic figure he hadbecome in her eyes.  She restrained herself with difficulty fromshowing a quaver in her voice.
　　To say truly, this would have been Carrie's attitude in any case.She had looked back at times upon her parting from Drouet and hadregretted that she had served him so badly.  She hoped she wouldnever meet him again, but she was ashamed of her conduct.  Notthat she had any choice in the final separation.  She had gonewillingly to seek him, with sympathy in her heart, when Hurstwoodhad reported him ill.  There was something cruel somewhere, andnot being able to track it mentally to its logical lair, sheconcluded with feeling that he would never understand whatHurstwood had done and would see hard-hearted decision in herdeed; hence her shame.  Not that she cared for him.  She did notwant to make any one who had been good to her feel badly.
　　She did not realise what she was doing by allowing these feelingsto possess her.  Hurstwood, noticing the kindness, conceivedbetter of her.  "Carrie's good-natured, anyhow," he thought.
　　Going to Miss Osborne's that afternoon, she found that littlelady packing and singing.
　　"Why don't you come over with me today?" she asked.
　　"Oh, I can't," said Carrie.  "I'll be there Friday.  Would youmind lending me the twenty-five dollars you spoke of?"
　　"Why, no," said Lola, going for her purse.
　　"I want to get some other things," said Carrie.
　　"Oh, that's all right," answered the little girl, good-naturedly,glad to be of service.It had been days since Hurstwood had done more than go to thegrocery or to the news-stand.  Now the weariness of indoors wasupon him--had been for two days--but chill, grey weather had heldhim back.  Friday broke fair and warm.  It was one of thoselovely harbingers of spring, given as a sign in dreary winterthat earth is not forsaken of warmth and beauty.  The blueheaven, holding its one golden orb, poured down a crystal wash ofwarm light.  It was plain, from the voice of the sparrows, thatall was halcyon outside.  Carrie raised the front windows, andfelt the south wind blowing.
　　"It's lovely out to-day," she remarked.
　　"Is it?" said Hurstwood.
　　After breakfast, he immediately got his other clothes.
　　"Will you be back for lunch?" asked Carrie nervously.
　　"No," he said.
　　He went out into the streets and tramped north, along SeventhAvenue, idly fixing upon the Harlem River as an objective point.He had seen some ships up there, the time he had called upon thebrewers.  He wondered how the territory thereabouts was growing.
　　Passing Fifty-ninth Street, he took the west side of CentralPark, which he followed to Seventy-eighth Street.  Then heremembered the neighbourhood and turned over to look at the massof buildings erected.  It was very much improved.  The great openspaces were filling up.  Coming back, he kept to the Park until110th Street, and then turned into Seventh Avenue again, reachingthe pretty river by one o'clock.
　　There it ran winding before his gaze, shining brightly in theclear light, between the undulating banks on the right and thetall, tree-covered heights on the left.  The spring-likeatmosphere woke him to a sense of its loveliness, and for a fewmoments he stood looking at it, folding his hands behind hisback.  Then he turned and followed it toward the east side, idlyseeking the ships he had seen.  It was four o'clock before thewaning day, with its suggestion of a cooler evening, caused himto return.  He was hungry and would enjoy eating in the warmroom.
　　When he reached the flat by half-past five, it was still dark.He knew that Carrie was not there, not only because there was nolight showing through the transom, but because the evening paperswere stuck between the outside knob and the door.  He opened withhis key and went in.  Everything was still dark.  Lighting thegas, he sat down, preparing to wait a little while.  Even ifCarrie did come now, dinner would be late.  He read until six,then got up to fix something for himself.
　　As he did so, he noticed that the room seemed a little queer.What was it? He looked around, as if he missed something, andthen saw an envelope near where he had been sitting.  It spokefor itself, almost without further action on his part.
　　Reaching over, he took it, a sort of chill settling upon him evenwhile he reached.  The crackle of the envelope in his hands wasloud.  Green paper money lay soft within the note.
　　"Dear George," he read, crunching the money in one hand, "I'mgoing away.  I'm not coming back any more.  It's no use trying tokeep up the flat; I can't do it.  I wouldn't mind helping you, ifI could, but I can't support us both, and pay the rent.  I needwhat little I make to pay for my clothes.  I'm leaving twentydollars.  It's all I have just now.  You can do whatever you likewith the furniture.  I won't want it.--CARRIE.
　　He dropped the note and looked quietly round.  Now he knew whathe missed.  It was the little ornamental clock, which was hers.It had gone from the mantelpiece.  He went into the front room,his bedroom, the parlour, lighting the gas as he went.  From thechiffonier had gone the knick-knacks of silver and plate.  Fromthe table-top, the lace coverings.  He opened the wardrobe--noclothes of hers.  He opened the drawers--nothing of hers.  Hertrunk was gone from its accustomed place.  Back in his own roomhung his old clothes, just as he had left them.  Nothing else wasgone.
　　He stepped into the parlour and stood for a few moments lookingvacantly at the floor.  The silence grew oppressive.  The littleflat seemed wonderfully deserted.  He wholly forgot that he washungry, that it was only dinner-time.  It seemed later in thenight.
　　Suddenly, he found that the money was still in his hands.  Therewere twenty dollars in all, as she had said.  Now he walked back,leaving the lights ablaze, and feeling as if the flat were empty.
　　"I'll get out of this," he said to himself.
　　Then the sheer loneliness of his situation rushed upon him infull.
　　"Left me!" he muttered, and repeated, "left me!"
　　The place that had been so comfortable, where he had spent somany days of warmth, was now a memory.  Something colder andchillier confronted him.  He sank down in his chair, resting hischin in his hand--mere sensation, without thought, holding him.
　　Then something like a bereaved affection and self-pity swept overhim.
　　"She needn't have gone away," he said.  "I'd have got something."
　　He sat a long while without rocking, and added quite clearly, outloud:
　　"I tried, didn't I?"
　　At midnight he was still rocking, staring at the floor.
　　Chapter XLIII
　　THE WORLD TURNS FLATTERER--AN EYE IN THE DARK
　　Installed in her comfortable room, Carrie wondered how Hurstwoodhad taken her departure.  She arranged a few things hastily andthen left for the theatre, half expecting to encounter him at thedoor.  Not finding him, her dread lifted, and she felt morekindly toward him.  She quite forgot him until about to come out,after the show, when the chance of his being there frightenedher.  As day after day passed and she heard nothing at all, thethought of being bothered by him passed.  In a little while shewas, except for occasional thoughts, wholly free of the gloomwith which her life had been weighed in the flat.
　　It is curious to note how quickly a profession absorbs one.Carrie became wise in theatrical lore, hearing the gossip oflittle Lola.  She learned what the theatrical papers were, whichones published items about actresses and the like.  She began toread the newspaper notices, not only of the opera in which shehad so small a part, but of others.  Gradually the desire fornotice took hold of her.  She longed to be renowned like others,and read with avidity all the complimentary or critical commentsmade concerning others high in her profession.  The showy worldin which her interest lay completely absorbed her.
　　It was about this time that the newspapers and magazines werebeginning to pay that illustrative attention to the beauties ofthe stage which has since become fervid.  The newspapers, andparticularly the Sunday newspapers, indulged in large decorativetheatrical pages, in which the faces and forms of well-knowntheatrical celebrities appeared, enclosed with artistic scrolls.The magazines also or at least one or two of the newer ones--published occasional portraits of pretty stars, and now and againphotos of scenes from various plays.  Carrie watched these withgrowing interest.  When would a scene from her opera appear? Whenwould some paper think her photo worth while?
　　The Sunday before taking her new part she scanned the theatricalpages for some little notice.  It would have accorded with herexpectations if nothing had been said, but there in the squibs,tailing off several more substantial items, was a wee notice.Carrie read it with a tingling body:
　　"The part of Katisha, the country maid, in 'The Wives of Abdul'at the Broadway, heretofore played by Inez Carew, will behereafter filled by Carrie Madenda, one of the cleverest membersof the chorus."
　　Carrie hugged herself with delight.  Oh, wasn't it just fine! Atlast! The first, the long-hoped for, the delightful notice! Andthey called her clever.  She could hardly restrain herself fromlaughing loudly.  Had Lola seen it?
　　"They've got a notice here of the part I'm going to play to-morrow night," said Carrie to her friend.
　　"Oh, jolly! Have they?" cried Lola, running to her.  "That's allright," she said, looking.  "You'll get more now, if you do well.I had my picture in the 'World' once."
　　"Did you?" asked Carrie.
　　"Did I? Well, I should say," returned the little girl.  "They hada frame around it."
　　Carrie laughed.
　　"They've never published my picture."
　　"But they will," said Lola.  "You'll see.  You do better thanmost that get theirs in now."
　　Carrie felt deeply grateful for this.  She almost loved Lola forthe sympathy and praise she extended.  It was so helpful to her--so almost necessary.
　　Fulfilling her part capably brought another notice in the papersthat she was doing her work acceptably.  This pleased herimmensely.  She began to think the world was taking note of her.
　　The first week she got her thirty-five dollars, it seemed anenormous sum.  Paying only three dollars for room rent seemedridiculous.  After giving Lola her twenty-five, she still hadseven dollars left.  With four left over from previous earnings,she had eleven.  Five of this went to pay the regular installmenton the clothes she had to buy.  The next week she was even ingreater feather.  Now, only three dollars need be paid for roomrent and five on her clothes.  The rest she had for food and herown whims.
　　"You'd better save a little for summer," cautioned Lola.  "We'llprobably close in May."
　　"I intend to," said Carrie.
　　The regular entrance of thirty-five dollars a week to one who hasendured scant allowances for several years is a demoralisingthing.  Carrie found her purse bursting with good green bills ofcomfortable denominations.  Having no one dependent upon her, shebegan to buy pretty clothes and pleasing trinkets, to eat well,and to ornament her room.  Friends were not long in gatheringabout.  She met a few young men who belonged to Lola's staff.The members of the opera company made her acquaintance withoutthe formality of introduction.  One of these discovered a fancyfor her.  On several occasions he strolled home with her.
　　"Let's stop in and have a rarebit," he suggested one midnight.
　　"Very well," said Carrie.
　　In the rosy restaurant, filled with the merry lovers of latehours, she found herself criticising this man.  He was toostilted, too self-opinionated.  He did not talk of anything thatlifted her above the common run of clothes and material success.When it was all over, he smiled most graciously.
　　"Got to go straight home, have you?" he said.
　　"Yes," she answered, with an air of quiet understanding.
　　"She's not so inexperienced as she looks," he thought, andthereafter his respect and ardour were increased.
　　She could not help sharing in Lola's love for a good time.  Therewere days when they went carriage riding, nights when after theshow they dined, afternoons when they strolled along Broadway,tastefully dressed.  She was getting in the metropolitan whirl ofpleasure.
　　At last her picture appeared in one of the weeklies.  She had notknown of it, and it took her breath.  "Miss Carrie Madenda," itwas labelled.  "One of the favourites of 'The Wives of Abdul'company." At Lola's advice she had had some pictures taken bySarony.  They had got one there.  She thought of going down andbuying a few copies of the paper, but remembered that there wasno one she knew well enough to send them to.  Only Lola,apparently, in all the world was interested.
　　The metropolis is a cold place socially, and Carrie soon foundthat a little money brought her nothing.  The world of wealth anddistinction was quite as far away as ever.  She could feel thatthere was no warm, sympathetic friendship back of the easymerriment with which many approached her.  All seemed to beseeking their own amusement, regardless of the possible sadconsequence to others.  So much for the lessons of Hurstwood andDrouet.
　　In April she learned that the opera would probably last until themiddle or the end of May, according to the size of the audiences.Next season it would go on the road.  She wondered if she wouldbe with it.  As usual, Miss Osborne, owing to her moderatesalary, was for securing a home engagement.
　　"They're putting on a summer play at the Casino," she announced,after figuratively putting her ear to the ground.  "Let's try andget in that."
　　"I'm willing," said Carrie.
　　They tried in time and were apprised of the proper date to applyagain.  That was May 16th.  Meanwhile their own show closed May5th.
　　"Those that want to go with the show next season," said themanager, "will have to sign this week."
　　"Don't you sign," advised Lola.  "I wouldn't go."
　　"I know," said Carrie, "but maybe I can't get anything else."
　　"Well, I won't," said the little girl, who had a resource in heradmirers.  "I went once and I didn't have anything at the end ofthe season."
　　Carrie thought this over.  She had never been on the road.
　　"We can get along," added Lola.  "I always have."
　　Carrie did not sign.
　　The manager who was putting on the summer skit at the Casino hadnever heard of Carrie, but the several notices she had received,her published picture, and the programme bearing her name hadsome little weight with him.  He gave her a silent part at thirtydollars a week.
　　"Didn't I tell you?" said Lola.  "It doesn't do you any good togo away from New York.  They forget all about you if you do."
　　Now, because Carrie was pretty, the gentlemen who made up theadvance illustrations of shows about to appear for the Sundaypapers selected Carrie's photo along with others to illustratethe announcement.  Because she was very pretty, they gave itexcellent space and drew scrolls about it.  Carrie was delighted.Still, the management did not seem to have seen anything of it.At least, no more attention was paid to her than before.  At thesame time there seemed very little in her part.  It consisted ofstanding around in all sorts of scenes, a silent littleQuakeress.  The author of the skit had fancied that a great dealcould be made of such a part, given to the right actress, butnow, since it had been doled out to Carrie, he would as leavehave had it cut out.
　　"Don't kick, old man," remarked the manager.  "If it don't go thefirst week we will cut it out."
　　Carrie had no warning of this halcyon intention.  She practisedher part ruefully, feeling that she was effectually shelved.  Atthe dress rehearsal she was disconsolate.
　　"That isn't so bad," said the author, the manager noting thecurious effect which Carrie's blues had upon the part.  "Tell herto frown a little more when Sparks dances."
　　Carrie did not know it, but there was the least show of wrinklesbetween her eyes and her mouth was puckered quaintly.
　　"Frown a little more, Miss Madenda," said the stage manager.
　　Carrie instantly brightened up, thinking he had meant it as arebuke.
　　"No; frown," he said.  "Frown as you did before."
　　Carrie looked at him in astonishment.
　　"I mean it," he said.  "Frown hard when Mr. Sparks dances.  Iwant to see how it looks."
　　It was easy enough to do.  Carrie scowled.  The effect wassomething so quaint and droll it caught even the manager.
　　"That is good," he said.  "If she'll do that all through, I thinkit will take."
　　Going over to Carrie, he said:
　　"Suppose you try frowning all through.  Do it hard.  Look mad.It'll make the part really funny."
　　On the opening night it looked to Carrie as if there were nothingto her part, after all.  The happy, sweltering audience did notseem to see her in the first act.  She frowned and frowned, butto no effect.  Eyes were riveted upon the more elaborate effortsof the stars.
　　In the second act, the crowd, wearied by a dull conversation,roved with its eyes about the stage and sighted her.  There shewas, grey-suited, sweet-faced, demure, but scowling.  At firstthe general idea was that she was temporarily irritated, that thelook was genuine and not fun at all.  As she went on frowning,looking now at one principal and now at the other, the audiencebegan to smile.  The portly gentlemen in the front rows began tofeel that she was a delicious little morsel.  It was the kind offrown they would have loved to force away with kisses.  All thegentlemen yearned toward her.  She was capital.
　　At last, the chief comedian, singing in the centre of the stage,noticed a giggle where it was not expected.  Then another andanother.  When the place came for loud applause it was onlymoderate.  What could be the trouble? He realised that somethingwas up.
　　All at once, after an exit, he caught sight of Carrie.  She wasfrowning alone on the stage and the audience was giggling andlaughing.
　　"By George, I won't stand that!" thought the thespian.  "I'm notgoing to have my work cut up by some one else.  Either she quitsthat when I do my turn or I quit."
　　"Why, that's all right," said the manager, when the kick came."That's what she's supposed to do.  You needn't pay any attentionto that."
　　"But she ruins my work."
　　"No, she don't," returned the former, soothingly.  "It's only alittle fun on the side."
　　"It is, eh?" exclaimed the big comedian.  "She killed my hand allright.  I'm not going to stand that."
　　"Well, wait until after the show.  Wait until to-morrow.  We'llsee what we can do."
　　The next act, however, settled what was to be done.  Carrie wasthe chief feature of the play.  The audience, the more it studiedher, the more it indicated its delight.  Every other featurepaled beside the quaint, teasing, delightful atmosphere whichCarrie contributed while on the stage.  Manager and companyrealised she had made a hit.
　　The critics of the daily papers completed her triumph.  Therewere long notices in praise of the quality of the burlesque,touched with recurrent references to Carrie.  The contagiousmirth of the thing was repeatedly emphasised.
　　"Miss Madenda presents one of the most delightful bits ofcharacter work ever seen on the Casino stage," observed the stagecritic of the "Sun."  "It is a bit of quiet, unassuming drollerywhich warms like good wine.  Evidently the part was not intendedto take precedence, as Miss Madenda is not often on the stage,but the audience, with the characteristic perversity of suchbodies, selected for itself.  The little Quakeress was marked fora favourite the moment she appeared, and thereafter easily heldattention and applause.  The vagaries of fortune are indeedcurious."
　　The critic of the "Evening World," seeking as usual to establisha catch phrase which should "go" with the town, wound up byadvising: "If you wish to be merry, see Carrie frown."
　　The result was miraculous so far as Carrie's fortune wasconcerned.  Even during the morning she received a congratulatorymessage from the manager.
　　"You seem to have taken the town by storm," he wrote.  "This isdelightful.  I am as glad for your sake as for my own."
　　The author also sent word.
　　That evening when she entered the theatre the manager had a mostpleasant greeting for her.
　　"Mr. Stevens," he said, referring to the author, "is preparing alittle song, which he would like you to sing next week."
　　"Oh, I can't sing," returned Carrie.
　　"It isn't anything difficult.  'It's something that is verysimple,' he says, 'and would suit you exactly.'"
　　"Of course, I wouldn't mind trying," said Carrie, archly.
　　"Would you mind coming to the box-office a few moments before youdress?" observed the manager, in addition.  "There's a littlematter I want to speak to you about."
　　"Certainly," replied Carrie.
　　In that latter place the manager produced a paper.
　　"Now, of course," he said, "we want to be fair with you in thematter of salary.  Your contract here only calls for thirtydollars a week for the next three months.  How would it do tomake it, say, one hundred and fifty a week and extend it fortwelve months?"
　　"Oh, very well," said Carrie, scarcely believing her ears.
　　"Supposing, then, you just sign this."
　　Carrie looked and beheld a new contract made out like the otherone, with the exception of the new figures of salary and time.With a hand trembling from excitement she affixed her name.
　　"One hundred and fifty a week!" she murmured, when she was againalone.  She found, after all--as what millionaire has not?--thatthere was no realising, in consciousness, the meaning of largesums.  It was only a shimmering, glittering phrase in which lay aworld of possibilities.
　　Down in a third-rate Bleecker Street hotel, the broodingHurstwood read the dramatic item covering Carrie's success,without at first realising who was meant.  Then suddenly it cameto him and he read the whole thing over again.
　　"That's her, all right, I guess," he said.
　　Then he looked about upon a dingy, moth-eaten hotel lobby.
　　"I guess she's struck it," he thought, a picture of the oldshiny, plush-covered world coming back, with its lights, itsornaments, its carriages, and flowers.  Ah, she was in the walledcity now! Its splendid gates had opened, admitting her from acold, dreary outside.  She seemed a creature afar off--like everyother celebrity he had known.
　　"Well, let her have it," he said.  "I won't bother her."
　　It was the grim resolution of a bent, bedraggled, but unbrokenpride.
　　Chapter XLIV
　　AND THIS IS NOT ELF LAND--WHAT GOLD WILL NOT BUY
　　When Carrie got back on the stage, she found that over night herdressing-room had been changed.
　　"You are to use this room, Miss Madenda," said one of the stagelackeys.
　　No longer any need of climbing several flights of steps to asmall coop shared with another.  Instead, a comparatively largeand commodious chamber with conveniences not enjoyed by the smallfry overhead.  She breathed deeply and with delight.  Hersensations were more physical than mental.  In fact, she wasscarcely thinking at all.  Heart and body were having their say.
　　Gradually the deference and congratulation gave her a mentalappreciation of her state.  She was no longer ordered, butrequested, and that politely.  The other members of the castlooked at her enviously as she came out arrayed in her simplehabit, which she wore all through the play.  All those who hadsupposedly been her equals and superiors now smiled the smile ofsociability, as much as to say: "How friendly we have alwaysbeen." Only the star comedian whose part had been so deeplyinjured stalked by himself.  Figuratively, he could not kiss thehand that smote him.
　　Doing her simple part, Carrie gradually realised the meaning ofthe applause which was for her, and it was sweet.  She feltmildly guilty of something--perhaps unworthiness.  When herassociates addressed her in the wings she only smiled weakly.The pride and daring of place were not for her.  It never oncecrossed her mind to be reserved or haughty--to be other than shehad been.  After the performances she rode to her room with Lola,in a carriage provided.
　　Then came a week in which the first fruits of success wereoffered to her lips--bowl after bowl.  It did not matter that hersplendid salary had not begun.  The world seemed satisfied withthe promise.  She began to get letters and cards.  A Mr. Withers--whom she did not know from Adam--having learned by some hook orcrook where she resided, bowed himself politely in.
　　"You will excuse me for intruding," he said; "but have you beenthinking of changing your apartments?"
　　"I hadn't thought of it," returned Carrie.
　　"Well, I am connected with the Wellington--the new hotel onBroadway.  You have probably seen notices of it in the papers."
　　Carrie recognised the name as standing for one of the newest andmost imposing hostelries.  She had heard it spoken of as having asplendid restaurant.
　　"Just so," went on Mr. Withers, accepting her acknowledgment offamiliarity.  "We have some very elegant rooms at present whichwe would like to have you look at, if you have not made up yourmind where you intend to reside for the summer.  Our apartmentsare perfect in every detail--hot and cold water, private baths,special hall service for every floor, elevators, and all that.You know what our restaurant is."
　　Carrie looked at him quietly.  She was wondering whether he tookher to be a millionaire.
　　"What are your rates?" she inquired.
　　"Well, now, that is what I came to talk with you privately about.Our regular rates are anywhere from three to fifty dollars aday."
　　"Mercy!" interrupted Carrie.  "I couldn't pay any such rate asthat."
　　"I know how you feel about it," exclaimed Mr. Withers, halting."But just let me explain.  I said those are our regular rates.Like every other hotel we make special ones however.  Possiblyyou have not thought about it, but your name is worth somethingto us.""Oh!" ejaculated Carrie, seeing at a glance.
　　"Of course.  Every hotel depends upon the repute of its patrons.A well-known actress like yourself," and he bowed politely, whileCarrie flushed, "draws attention to the hotel, and--although youmay not believe it--patrons."
　　"Oh, yes," returned Carrie, vacantly, trying to arrange thiscurious proposition in her mind.
　　"Now," continued Mr. Withers, swaying his derby hat softly andbeating one of his polished shoes upon the floor, "I want toarrange, if possible, to have you come and stop at theWellington.  You need not trouble about terms.  In fact, we needhardly discuss them.  Anything will do for the summer--a merefigure--anything that you think you could afford to pay."
　　Carrie was about to interrupt, but he gave her no chance.
　　"You can come to-day or to-morrow--the earlier the better--and wewill give you your choice of nice, light, outside rooms--the verybest we have."
　　"You're very kind," said Carrie, touched by the agent's extremeaffability.  "I should like to come very much.  I would want topay what is right, however.  I shouldn't want to----"
　　"You need not trouble about that at all," interrupted Mr.Withers.  "We can arrange that to your entire satisfaction at anytime.  If three dollars a day is satisfactory to you, it will beso to us.  All you have to do is to pay that sum to the clerk atthe end of the week or month, just as you wish, and he will giveyou a receipt for what the rooms would cost if charged for at ourregular rates."
　　The speaker paused.
　　"Suppose you come and look at the rooms," he added.
　　"I'd be glad to," said Carrie, "but I have a rehearsal thismorning."
　　"I did not mean at once," he returned.  "Any time will do.  Wouldthis afternoon be inconvenient?"
　　"Not at all," said Carrie.
　　Suddenly she remembered Lola, who was out at the time.
　　"I have a room-mate," she added, "who will have to go wherever Ido.  I forgot about that."
　　"Oh, very well," said Mr. Withers, blandly.  "It is for you tosay whom you want with you.  As I say, all that can be arrangedto suit yourself."
　　He bowed and backed toward the door.
　　"At four, then, we may expect you?"
　　"Yes," said Carrie.
　　"I will be there to show you," and so Mr. Withers withdrew.
　　After rehearsal Carrie informed Lola."Did they really?" exclaimed the latter, thinking of theWellington as a group of managers.  "Isn't that fine? Oh, jolly!It's so swell.  That's where we dined that night we went withthose two Cushing boys.  Don't you know?"
　　"I remember," said Carrie.
　　"Oh, it's as fine as it can be."
　　"We'd better be going up there," observed Carrie later in theafternoon.
　　The rooms which Mr. Withers displayed to Carrie and Lola werethree and bath--a suite on the parlour floor.  They were done inchocolate and dark red, with rugs and hangings to match.  Threewindows looked down into busy Broadway on the east, three into aside street which crossed there.  There were two lovely bedrooms,set with brass and white enamel beds, white ribbon-trimmed chairsand chiffoniers to match.  In the third room, or parlour, was apiano, a heavy piano lamp, with a shade of gorgeous pattern, alibrary table, several huge easy rockers, some dado book shelves,and a gilt curio case, filled with oddities.  Pictures were uponthe walls, soft Turkish pillows upon the divan footstools ofbrown plush upon the floor.  Such accommodations would ordinarilycost a hundred dollars a week.
　　"Oh, lovely!" exclaimed Lola, walking about.
　　"It is comfortable," said Carrie, who was lifting a lace curtainand looking down into crowded Broadway.
　　The bath was a handsome affair, done in white enamel, with alarge, blue-bordered stone tub and nickel trimmings.  It wasbright and commodious, with a bevelled mirror set in the wall atone end and incandescent lights arranged in three places.
　　"Do you find these satisfactory?" observed Mr. Withers.
　　"Oh, very," answered Carrie.
　　"Well, then, any time you find it convenient to move in, they areready.  The boy will bring you the keys at the door."
　　Carrie noted the elegantly carpeted and decorated hall, themarbled lobby, and showy waiting-room.  It was such a place asshe had often dreamed of occupying.
　　"I guess we'd better move right away, don't you think so?" sheobserved to Lola, thinking of the commonplace chamber inSeventeenth Street.
　　"Oh, by all means," said the latter.
　　The next day her trunks left for the new abode.
　　Dressing, after the matinee on Wednesday, a knock came at herdressing-room door.
　　Carrie looked at the card handed by the boy and suffered a shockof surprise.
　　"Tell her I'll be right out," she said softly.  Then, looking atthe card, added: "Mrs. Vance."
　　"Why, you little sinner," the latter exclaimed, as she saw Carriecoming toward her across the now vacant stage.  "How in the worlddid this happen?"
　　Carrie laughed merrily.  There was no trace of embarrassment inher friend's manner.  You would have thought that the longseparation had come about accidentally.
　　"I don't know," returned Carrie, warming, in spite of her firsttroubled feelings, toward this handsome, good-natured youngmatron.
　　"Well, you know, I saw your picture in the Sunday paper, but yourname threw me off.  I thought it must be you or somebody thatlooked just like you, and I said: 'Well, now, I will go rightdown there and see.' I was never more surprised in my life.  Howare you, anyway?"
　　"Oh, very well," returned Carrie.  "How have you been?"
　　"Fine.  But aren't you a success! Dear, oh! All the paperstalking about you.  I should think you would be just too proud tobreathe.  I was almost afraid to come back here this afternoon."
　　"Oh, nonsense," said Carrie, blushing.  "You know I'd be glad tosee you."
　　"Well, anyhow, here you are.  Can't you come up and take dinnerwith me now? Where are you stopping?"
　　"At the Wellington," said Carrie, who permitted herself a touchof pride in the acknowledgment.
　　"Oh, are you?" exclaimed the other, upon whom the name was notwithout its proper effect.
　　Tactfully, Mrs. Vance avoided the subject of Hurstwood, of whomshe could not help thinking.  No doubt Carrie had left him.  Thatmuch she surmised.
　　"Oh, I don't think I can," said Carrie, "to-night.  I have solittle time.  I must be back here by 7.30.  Won't you come anddine with me?"
　　"I'd be delighted, but I can't to-night," said Mrs. Vancestudying Carrie's fine appearance.  The latter's good fortunemade her seem more than ever worthy and delightful in the otherseyes.  "I promised faithfully to be home at six." Glancing at thesmall gold watch pinned to her bosom, she added: "I must begoing, too.  Tell me when you're coming up, if at all."
　　"Why, any time you like," said Carrie.
　　"Well, to-morrow then.  I'm living at the Chelsea now."
　　"Moved again?" exclaimed Carrie, laughing.
　　"Yes.  You know I can't stay six months in one place.  I justhave to move.  Remember now--half-past five."
　　"I won't forget," said Carrie, casting a glance at her as shewent away.  Then it came to her that she was as good as thiswoman now--perhaps better.  Something in the other's solicitudeand interest made her feel as if she were the one to condescend.
　　Now, as on each preceding day, letters were handed her by thedoorman at the Casino.  This was a feature which had rapidlydeveloped since Monday.  What they contained she well knew.  MASHNOTES were old affairs in their mildest form.  She rememberedhaving received her first one far back in Columbia City.  Sincethen, as a chorus girl, she had received others--gentlemen whoprayed for an engagement.  They were common sport between her andLola, who received some also.  They both frequently made light ofthem.
　　Now, however, they came thick and fast.  Gentlemen with fortunesdid not hesitate to note, as an addition to their own amiablecollection of virtues, that they had their horses and carriages.Thus one:
　　"I have a million in my own right.  I could give you everyluxury.  There isn't anything you could ask for that you couldn'thave.  I say this, not because I want to speak of my money, butbecause I love you and wish to gratify your every desire.  It islove that prompts me to write.  Will you not give me one half-hour in which to plead my cause?"
　　Such of these letters as came while Carrie was still in theSeventeenth Street place were read with more interest--thoughnever delight--than those which arrived after she was installedin her luxurious quarters at the Wellington.  Even there hervanity--or that self-appreciation which, in its more rabid form,is called vanity--was not sufficiently cloyed to make thesethings wearisome.  Adulation, being new in any form, pleased her.Only she was sufficiently wise to distinguish between her oldcondition and her new one.  She had not had fame or money before.Now they had come.  She had not had adulation and affectionatepropositions before.  Now they had come.  Wherefore? She smiledto think that men should suddenly find her so much moreattractive.  In the least way it incited her to coolness andindifference.
　　"Do look here," she remarked to Lola.  "See what this man says:'If you will only deign to grant me one half-hour,'" sherepeated, with an imitation of languor.  "The idea.  Aren't mensilly?"
　　"He must have lots of money, the way he talks," observed Lola."That's what they all say," said Carrie, innocently.
　　"Why don't you see him," suggested Lola, "and hear what he has tosay?"
　　"Indeed I won't," said Carrie.  "I know what he'd say.  I don'twant to meet anybody that way."
　　Lola looked at her with big, merry eyes.
　　"He couldn't hurt you," she returned.  "You might have some funwith him."
　　Carrie shook her head.
　　"You're awfully queer," returned the little, blue-eyed soldier.
　　Thus crowded fortune.  For this whole week, though her largesalary had not yet arrived, it was as if the world understood andtrusted her.  Without money--or the requisite sum, at least--sheenjoyed the luxuries which money could buy.  For her the doors offine places seemed to open quite without the asking.  Thesepalatial chambers, how marvellously they came to her.  Theelegant apartments of Mrs. Vance in the Chelsea--these were hers.Men sent flowers, love notes, offers of fortune.  And still herdreams ran riot.  The one hundred and fifty! the one hundred andfifty! What a door to an Aladdin's cave it seemed to be.  Eachday, her head almost turned by developments, her fancies of whather fortune must be, with ample money, grew and multiplied.  Sheconceived of delights which were not--saw lights of joy thatnever were on land or sea.  Then, at last, after a world ofanticipation, came her first installment of one hundred and fiftydollars.
　　It was paid to her in greenbacks--three twenties, six tens, andsix fives.  Thus collected it made a very convenient roll.  Itwas accompanied by a smile and a salutation from the cashier whopaid it.
　　"Ah, yes," said the latter, when she applied; "Miss Madenda--onehundred and fifty dollars.  Quite a success the show seems tohave made."
　　"Yes, indeed," returned Carrie.
　　Right after came one of the insignificant members of the company,and she heard the changed tone of address.
　　"How much?" said the same cashier, sharply.  One, such as she hadonly recently been, was waiting for her modest salary.  It tookher back to the few weeks in which she had collected--or ratherhad received--almost with the air of a domestic, four-fifty perweek from a lordly foreman in a shoe factory--a man who, indistributing the envelopes, had the manner of a prince doling outfavours to a servile group of petitioners.  She knew that out inChicago this very day the same factory chamber was full of poorhomely-clad girls working in long lines at clattering machines;that at noon they would eat a miserable lunch in a half-hour;that Saturday they would gather, as they had when she was one ofthem, and accept the small pay for work a hundred times harderthan she was now doing.  Oh, it was so easy now! The world was sorosy and bright.  She felt so thrilled that she must needs walkback to the hotel to think, wondering what she should do.
　　It does not take money long to make plain its impotence,providing the desires are in the realm of affection.  With herone hundred and fifty in hand, Carrie could think of nothingparticularly to do.  In itself, as a tangible, apparent thingwhich she could touch and look upon, it was a diverting thing fora few days, but this soon passed.  Her hotel bill did not requireits use.  Her clothes had for some time been wholly satisfactory.Another day or two and she would receive another hundred andfifty.  It began to appear as if this were not so startlinglynecessary to maintain her present state.  If she wanted to doanything better or move higher she must have more--a great dealmore.
　　Now a critic called to get up one of those tinsel interviewswhich shine with clever observations, show up the wit of critics,display the folly of celebrities, and divert the public.  Heliked Carrie, and said so, publicly--adding, however, that shewas merely pretty, good-natured, and lucky.  This cut like aknife.  The "Herald," getting up an entertainment for the benefitof its free ice fund, did her the honour to beg her to appearalong with celebrities for nothing.  She was visited by a youngauthor, who had a play which he thought she could produce.  Alas,she could not judge.  It hurt her to think it.  Then she foundshe must put her money in the bank for safety, and so moving,finally reached the place where it struck her that the door tolife's perfect enjoyment was not open.
　　Gradually she began to think it was because it was summer.Nothing was going on much save such entertainments as the one inwhich she was the star.  Fifth Avenue was boarded up where therich had deserted their mansions.  Madison Avenue was littlebetter.  Broadway was full of loafing thespians in search of nextseason's engagements.  The whole city was quiet and her nightswere taken up with her work.  Hence the feeling that there waslittle to do.
　　"I don't know," she said to Lola one day, sitting at one of thewindows which looked down into Broadway, "I get lonely; don'tyou?"
　　"No," said Lola, "not very often.  You won't go anywhere.  That'swhat's the matter with you."
　　"Where can I go?"
　　"Why, there're lots of places," returned Lola, who was thinkingof her own lightsome tourneys with the gay youths.  "You won't gowith anybody."
　　"I don't want to go with these people who write to me.  I knowwhat kind they are."
　　"You oughtn't to be lonely," said Lola, thinking of Carrie'ssuccess.  "There're lots would give their ears to be in yourshoes."
　　Carrie looked out again at the passing crowd.
　　"I don't know," she said.
　　Unconsciously her idle hands were beginning to weary.
　　Chapter XLV
　　CURIOUS SHIFTS OF THE POOR
　　The gloomy Hurstwood, sitting in his cheap hotel, where he hadtaken refuge with seventy dollars--the price of his furniture--between him and nothing, saw a hot summer out and a cool fall in,reading.  He was not wholly indifferent to the fact that hismoney was slipping away.  As fifty cents after fifty cents werepaid out for a day's lodging he became uneasy, and finally took acheaper room--thirty-five cents a day--to make his money lastlonger.  Frequently he saw notices of Carrie.  Her picture was inthe "World" once or twice, and an old "Herald" he found in achair informed him that she had recently appeared with someothers at a benefit for something or other.  He read these thingswith mingled feelings.  Each one seemed to put her farther andfarther away into a realm which became more imposing as itreceded from him.  On the billboards, too, he saw a prettyposter, showing her as the Quaker Maid, demure and dainty.  Morethan once he stopped and looked at these, gazing at the prettyface in a sullen sort of way.  His clothes were shabby, and hepresented a marked contrast to all that she now seemed to be.
　　Somehow, so long as he knew she was at the Casino, though he hadnever any intention of going near her, there was a subconsciouscomfort for him--he was not quite alone.  The show seemed such afixture that, after a month or two, he began to take it forgranted that it was still running.  In September it went on theroad and he did not notice it.  When all but twenty dollars ofhis money was gone, he moved to a fifteen-cent lodging-house inthe Bowery, where there was a bare lounging-room filled withtables and benches as well as some chairs.  Here his preferencewas to close his eyes and dream of other days, a habit which grewupon him.  It was not sleep at first, but a mental hearkeningback to scenes and incidents in his Chicago life.  As the presentbecame darker, the past grew brighter, and all that concerned itstood in relief.
　　He was unconscious of just how much this habit had hold of himuntil one day he found his lips repeating an old answer he hadmade to one of his friends.  They were in Fitzgerald and Moy's.It was as if he stood in the door of his elegant little office,comfortably dressed, talking to Sagar Morrison about the value ofSouth Chicago real estate in which the latter was about toinvest.
　　"How would you like to come in on that with me?" he heardMorrison say.
　　"Not me," he answered, just as he had years before.  "I have myhands full now."
　　The movement of his lips aroused him.  He wondered whether he hadreally spoken.  The next time he noticed anything of the sort hereally did talk.
　　"Why don't you jump, you bloody fool?" he was saying.  "Jump!"
　　It was a funny English story he was telling to a company ofactors.  Even as his voice recalled him, he was smiling.  Acrusty old codger, sitting near by, seemed disturbed; at least,he stared in a most pointed way.  Hurstwood straightened up.  Thehumour of the memory fled in an instant and he felt ashamed.  Forrelief, he left his chair and strolled out into the streets.
　　One day, looking down the ad. columns of the "Evening World," hesaw where a new play was at the Casino.  Instantly, he came to amental halt.  Carrie had gone! He remembered seeing a poster ofher only yesterday, but no doubt it was one left uncovered by thenew signs.  Curiously, this fact shook him up.  He had almost toadmit that somehow he was depending upon her being in the city.Now she was gone.  He wondered how this important fact hadskipped him.  Goodness knows when she would be back now.Impelled by a nervous fear, he rose and went into the dingy hall,where he counted his remaining money, unseen.  There were but tendollars in all.
　　He wondered how all these other lodging-house people around himgot along.  They didn't seem to do anything.  Perhaps theybegged--unquestionably they did.  Many was the dime he had givento such as they in his day.  He had seen other men asking formoney on the streets.  Maybe he could get some that way.  Therewas horror in this thought.
　　Sitting in the lodging-house room, he came to his last fiftycents.  He had saved and counted until his health was affected.His stoutness had gone.  With it, even the semblance of a fit inhis clothes.  Now he decided he must do something, and, walkingabout, saw another day go by, bringing him down to his lasttwenty cents--not enough to eat for the morrow.
　　Summoning all his courage, he crossed to Broadway and up to theBroadway Central hotel.  Within a block he halted, undecided.  Abig, heavy-faced porter was standing at one of the sideentrances, looking out.  Hurstwood purposed to appeal to him.Walking straight up, he was upon him before he could turn away.
　　"My friend," he said, recognising even in his plight the man'sinferiority, "is there anything about this hotel that I could getto do?"
　　The porter stared at him the while he continued to talk.
　　"I'm out of work and out of money and I've got to get something,--it doesn't matter what.  I don't care to talk about what I'vebeen, but if you'd tell me how to get something to do, I'd bemuch obliged to you.  It wouldn't matter if it only lasted a fewdays just now.  I've got to have something."
　　The porter still gazed, trying to look indifferent.  Then, seeingthat Hurstwood was about to go on, he said:
　　"I've nothing to do with it.  You'll have to ask inside."
　　Curiously, this stirred Hurstwood to further effort.
　　"I thought you might tell me."
　　The fellow shook his head irritably.
　　Inside went the ex-manager and straight to an office off theclerk's desk.  One of the managers of the hotel happened to bethere.  Hurstwood looked him straight in the eye.
　　"Could you give me something to do for a few days?" he said."I'm in a position where I have to get something at once."
　　The comfortable manager looked at him, as much as to say: "Well,I should judge so."
　　"I came here," explained Hurstwood, nervously, "because I've beena manager myself in my day.  I've had bad luck in a way but I'mnot here to tell you that.  I want something to do, if only for aweek."
　　The man imagined he saw a feverish gleam in the applicant's eye.
　　"What hotel did you manage?" he inquired.
　　"It wasn't a hotel," said Hurstwood.  "I was manager ofFitzgerald and Moy's place in Chicago for fifteen years."
　　"Is that so?" said the hotel man.  "How did you come to get outof that?"
　　The figure of Hurstwood was rather surprising in contrast to thefact.
　　"Well, by foolishness of my own.  It isn't anything to talk aboutnow.  You could find out if you wanted to.  I'm 'broke' now and,if you will believe me, I haven't eaten anything to-day."
　　The hotel man was slightly interested in this story.  He couldhardly tell what to do with such a figure, and yet Hurstwood'searnestness made him wish to do something.
　　"Call Olsen," he said, turning to the clerk.
　　In reply to a bell and a disappearing hall-boy, Olsen, the headporter, appeared.
　　"Olsen," said the manager, "is there anything downstairs youcould find for this man to do? I'd like to give him something."
　　"I don't know, sir," said Olsen.  "We have about all the help weneed.  I think I could find something, sir, though, if you like."
　　"Do.  Take him to the kitchen and tell Wilson to give himsomething to eat."
　　"All right, sir," said Olsen.
　　Hurstwood followed.  Out of the manager's sight, the headporter's manner changed.
　　"I don't know what the devil there is to do," he observed.
　　Hurstwood said nothing.  To him the big trunk hustler was asubject for private contempt.
　　"You're to give this man something to eat," he observed to thecook.
　　The latter looked Hurstwood over, and seeing something keen andintellectual in his eyes, said:
　　"Well, sit down over there."
　　Thus was Hurstwood installed in the Broadway Central, but not forlong.  He was in no shape or mood to do the scrub work thatexists about the foundation of every hotel.  Nothing betteroffering, he was set to aid the fireman, to work about thebasement, to do anything and everything that might offer.Porters, cooks, firemen, clerks--all were over him.  Moreover hisappearance did not please these individuals--his temper was toolonely--and they made it disagreeable for him.
　　With the stolidity and indifference of despair, however, heendured it all, sleeping in an attic at the roof of the house,eating what the cook gave him, accepting a few dollars a week,which he tried to save.  His constitution was in no shape toendure.
　　One day the following February he was sent on an errand to alarge coal company's office.  It had been snowing and thawing andthe streets were sloppy.  He soaked his shoes in his progress andcame back feeling dull and weary.  All the next day he feltunusually depressed and sat about as much as possible, to theirritation of those who admired energy in others.
　　In the afternoon some boxes were to be moved to make room for newculinary supplies.  He was ordered to handle a truck.Encountering a big box, he could not lift it.
　　"What's the matter there?" said the head porter.  "Can't youhandle it?"
　　He was straining to lift it, but now he quit.
　　"No," he said, weakly.
　　The man looked at him and saw that he was deathly pale.
　　"Not sick, are you?" he asked."I think I am," returned Hurstwood.
　　"Well, you'd better go sit down, then."
　　This he did, but soon grew rapidly worse.  It seemed all he coulddo to crawl to his room, where he remained for a day.
　　"That man Wheeler's sick," reported one of the lackeys to thenight clerk.
　　"What's the matter with him?"
　　"I don't know.  He's got a high fever."
　　The hotel physician looked at him.
　　"Better send him to Bellevue," he recommended.  "He's gotpneumonia."
　　Accordingly, he was carted away.
　　In three weeks the worst was over, but it was nearly the first ofMay before his strength permitted him to be turned out.  Then hewas discharged.
　　No more weakly looking object ever strolled out into the springsunshine than the once hale, lusty manager.  All his corpulencyhad fled.  His face was thin and pale, his hands white, his bodyflabby.  Clothes and all, he weighed but one hundred and thirty-five pounds.  Some old garments had been given him--a cheap browncoat and misfit pair of trousers.  Also some change and advice.He was told to apply to the charities.
　　Again he resorted to the Bowery lodging-house, brooding overwhere to look.  From this it was but a step to beggary.
　　"What can a man do?" he said.  "I can't starve."
　　His first application was in sunny Second Avenue.  A well-dressedman came leisurely strolling toward him out of Stuyvesant Park.Hurstwood nerved himself and sidled near.
　　"Would you mind giving me ten cents?" he said, directly.  "I'm ina position where I must ask some one."
　　The man scarcely looked at him, fished in his vest pocket andtook out a dime.
　　"There you are," he said.
　　"Much obliged," said Hurstwood, softly, but the other paid nomore attention to him.
　　Satisfied with his success and yet ashamed of his situation, hedecided that he would only ask for twenty-five cents more, sincethat would be sufficient.  He strolled about sizing up people,but it was long before just the right face and situation arrived.When he asked, he was refused.  Shocked by this result, he tookan hour to recover and then asked again.  This time a nickel wasgiven him.  By the most watchful effort he did get twenty centsmore, but it was painful.
　　The next day he resorted to the same effort, experiencing avariety of rebuffs and one or two generous receptions.  At lastit crossed his mind that there was a science of faces, and that aman could pick the liberal countenance if he tried.
　　It was no pleasure to him, however, this stopping of passers-by.He saw one man taken up for it and now troubled lest he should bearrested.  Nevertheless, he went on, vaguely anticipating thatindefinite something which is always better.
　　It was with a sense of satisfaction, then, that he saw announcedone morning the return of the Casino Company, "with Miss CarrieMadenda." He had thought of her often enough in days past.  Howsuccessful she was--how much money she must have! Even now,however, it took a severe run of ill luck to decide him to appealto her.  He was truly hungry before he said:
　　"I'll ask her.  She won't refuse me a few dollars."
　　Accordingly, he headed for the Casino one afternoon, passing itseveral times in an effort to locate the stage entrance.  Then hesat in Bryant Park, a block away, waiting.  "She can't refuse tohelp me a little," he kept saying to himself.
　　Beginning with half-past six, he hovered like a shadow about theThirty-ninth Street entrance, pretending always to be a hurryingpedestrian and yet fearful lest he should miss his object.  Hewas slightly nervous, too, now that the eventful hour hadarrived; but being weak and hungry, his ability to suffer wasmodified.  At last he saw that the actors were beginning toarrive, and his nervous tension increased, until it seemed as ifhe could not stand much more.
　　Once he thought he saw Carrie coming and moved forward, only tosee that he was mistaken.
　　"She can't be long, now," he said to himself, half fearing toencounter her and equally depressed at the thought that she mighthave gone in by another way.  His stomach was so empty that itached.
　　Individual after individual passed him, nearly all well dressed,almost all indifferent.  He saw coaches rolling by, gentlemenpassing with ladies--the evening's merriment was beginning inthis region of theatres and hotels.
　　Suddenly a coach rolled up and the driver jumped down to open thedoor.  Before Hurstwood could act, two ladies flounced across thebroad walk and disappeared in the stage door.  He thought he sawCarrie, but it was so unexpected, so elegant and far away, hecould hardly tell.  He waited a while longer, growing feverishwith want, and then seeing that the stage door no longer opened,and that a merry audience was arriving, he concluded it must havebeen Carrie and turned away.
　　"Lord," he said, hastening out of the street into which the morefortunate were pouring, "I've got to get something."
　　At that hour, when Broadway is wont to assume its mostinteresting aspect, a peculiar individual invariably took hisstand at the corner of Twenty-sixth Street and Broadway--a spotwhich is also intersected by Fifth Avenue.  This was the hourwhen the theatres were just beginning to receive their patrons.Fire signs announcing the night's amusements blazed on everyhand.  Cabs and carriages, their lamps gleaming like yellow eyes,pattered by.  Couples and parties of three and four freelymingled in the common crowd, which poured by in a thick stream,laughing and jesting.  On Fifth Avenue were loungers--a fewwealthy strollers, a gentleman in evening dress with his lady onhis arm, some club-men passing from one smoking-room to another.Across the way the great hotels showed a hundred gleamingwindows, their cafes and billiard-rooms filled with acomfortable, well-dressed, and pleasure-loving throng.  All aboutwas the night, pulsating with the thoughts of pleasure andexhilaration--the curious enthusiasm of a great city bent uponfinding joy in a thousand different ways.
　　This unique individual was no less than an ex-soldier turnedreligionist, who, having suffered the whips and privations of ourpeculiar social system, had concluded that his duty to the Godwhich he conceived lay in aiding his fellow-man.  The form of aidwhich he chose to administer was entirely original with himself.It consisted of securing a bed for all such homeless wayfarers asshould apply to him at this particular spot, though he hadscarcely the wherewithal to provide a comfortable habitation forhimself.  Taking his place amid this lightsome atmosphere, hewould stand, his stocky figure cloaked in a great cape overcoat,his head protected by a broad slouch hat, awaiting the applicantswho had in various ways learned the nature of his charity.  For awhile he would stand alone, gazing like any idler upon an ever-fascinating scene.  On the evening in question, a policemanpassing saluted him as "captain," in a friendly way.  An urchinwho had frequently seen him before, stopped to gaze.  All otherstook him for nothing out of the ordinary, save in the matter ofdress, and conceived of him as a stranger whistling and idlingfor his own amusement.
　　As the first half-hour waned, certain characters appeared.  Hereand there in the passing crowds one might see, now and then, aloiterer edging interestedly near.  A slouchy figure crossed theopposite corner and glanced furtively in his direction.  Anothercame down Fifth Avenue to the corner of Twenty-sixth Street, tooka general survey, and hobbled off again.  Two or three noticeableBowery types edged along the Fifth Avenue side of Madison Square,but did not venture over.  The soldier, in his cape overcoat,walked a short line of ten feet at his corner, to and fro,indifferently whistling.
　　As nine o'clock approached, some of the hubbub of the earlierhour passed.  The atmosphere of the hotels was not so youthful.The air, too, was colder.  On every hand curious figures weremoving--watchers and peepers, without an imaginary circle, whichthey seemed afraid to enter--a dozen in all.  Presently, with thearrival of a keener sense of cold, one figure came forward.  Itcrossed Broadway from out the shadow of Twenty-sixth Street, and,in a halting, circuitous way, arrived close to the waitingfigure.  There was something shamefaced or diffident about themovement, as if the intention were to conceal any idea ofstopping until the very last moment.  Then suddenly, close to thesoldier, came the halt.
　　The captain looked in recognition, but there was no especialgreeting.  The newcomer nodded slightly and murmured somethinglike one who waits for gifts.  The other simply motioned to-wardthe edge of the walk.
　　"Stand over there," he said.
　　By this the spell was broken.  Even while the soldier resumed hisshort, solemn walk, other figures shuffled forward.  They did notso much as greet the leader, but joined the one, sniffling andhitching and scraping their feet.
　　"Gold, ain't it?"
　　"I'm glad winter's over."
　　"Looks as though it might rain."
　　The motley company had increased to ten.  One or two knew eachother and conversed.  Others stood off a few feet, not wishing tobe in the crowd and yet not counted out.  They were peevish,crusty, silent, eying nothing in particular and moving theirfeet.
　　There would have been talking soon, but the soldier gave them nochance.  Counting sufficient to begin, he came forward.
　　"Beds, eh, all of you?"
　　There was a general shuffle and murmur of approval.
　　"Well, line up here.  I'll see what I can do.  I haven't a centmyself."
　　They fell into a sort of broken, ragged line.  One might see,now, some of the chief characteristics by contrast.  There was awooden leg in the line.  Hats were all drooping, a group thatwould ill become a second-hand Hester Street basement collection.Trousers were all warped and frayed at the bottom and coats wornand faded.  In the glare of the store lights, some of the faceslooked dry and chalky; others were red with blotches and puffedin the cheeks and under the eyes; one or two were rawboned andreminded one of railroad hands.  A few spectators came near,drawn by the seemingly conferring group, then more and more, andquickly there was a pushing, gaping crowd.  Some one in the linebegan to talk.
　　"Silence!" exclaimed the captain.  "Now, then, gentlemen, thesemen are without beds.  They have to have some place to sleep to-night.  They can't lie out in the streets.  I need twelve centsto put one of them to bed.  Who will give it to me?"
　　No reply.
　　"Well, we'll have to wait here, boys, until some one does.Twelve cents isn't so very much for one man."
　　"Here's fifteen," exclaimed a young man, peering forward withstrained eyes.  "It's all I can afford."
　　"All right.  Now I have fifteen.  Step out of the line," andseizing one by the shoulder, the captain marched him off a littleway and stood him up alone.
　　Coming back, he resumed his place and began again.
　　"I have three cents left.  These men must be put to bed somehow.There are"--counting--"one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve men.  Nine cents more will putthe next man to bed; give him a good, comfortable bed for thenight.  I go right along and look after that myself.  Who willgive me nine cents?"
　　One of the watchers, this time a middle-aged man, handed him afive-cent piece.
　　"Now, I have eight cents.  Four more will give this man a bed.Come, gentlemen.  We are going very slow this evening.  You allhave good beds.  How about these?"
　　"Here you are," remarked a bystander, putting a coin into hishand.
　　"That," said the captain, looking at the coin, "pays for two bedsfor two men and gives me five on the next one.  Who will give meseven cents more?"
　　"I will," said a voice.
　　Coming down Sixth Avenue this evening, Hurstwood chanced to crosseast through Twenty-sixth Street toward Third Avenue.  He waswholly disconsolate in spirit, hungry to what he deemed an almostmortal extent, weary, and defeated.  How should he get at Carrienow? It would be eleven before the show was over.  If she came ina coach, she would go away in one.  He would need to interruptunder most trying circumstances.  Worst of all, he was hungry andweary, and at best a whole day must intervene, for he had notheart to try again to-night.  He had no food and no bed.
　　When he neared Broadway, he noticed the captain's gathering ofwanderers, but thinking it to be the result of a street preacheror some patent medicine fakir, was about to pass on.  However, incrossing the street toward Madison Square Park, he noticed theline of men whose beds were already secured, stretching out fromthe main body of the crowd.  In the glare of the neighbouringelectric light he recognised a type of his own kind--the figureswhom he saw about the streets and in the lodging-houses, driftingin mind and body like himself.  He wondered what it could be andturned back.
　　There was the captain curtly pleading as before.  He heard withastonishment and a sense of relief the oft-repeated words: "Thesemen must have a bed." Before him was the line of unfortunateswhose beds were yet to be had, and seeing a newcomer quietly edgeup and take a position at the end of the line, he decided to dolikewise.  What use to contend? He was weary to-night.  It was asimple way out of one difficulty, at least.  To-morrow, maybe, hewould do better.
　　Back of him, where some of those were whose beds were safe, arelaxed air was apparent.  The strain of uncertainty beingremoved, he heard them talking with moderate freedom and someleaning toward sociability.  Politics, religion, the state of thegovernment, some newspaper sensations, and the more notoriousfacts the world over, found mouthpieces and auditors there.Cracked and husky voices pronounced forcibly upon odd matters.Vague and rambling observations were made in reply.
　　There were squints, and leers, and some dull, ox-like stares fromthose who were too dull or too weary to converse.
　　Standing tells.  Hurstwood became more weary waiting.  He thoughthe should drop soon and shifted restlessly from one foot to theother.  At last his turn came.  The man ahead had been paid forand gone to the blessed line of success.  He was now first, andalready the captain was talking for him.
　　"Twelve cents, gentlemen--twelve cents puts this man to bed.  Hewouldn't stand here in the cold if he had any place to go."
　　Hurstwood swallowed something that rose to his throat.  Hungerand weakness had made a coward of him.
　　"Here you are," said a stranger, handing money to the captain.
　　Now the latter put a kindly hand on the ex-manager's shoulder."Line up over there," he said.
　　Once there, Hurstwood breathed easier.  He felt as if the worldwere not quite so bad with such a good man in it.  Others seemedto feel like himself about this.
　　"Captain's a great feller, ain't he?" said the man ahead--alittle, woebegone, helpless-looking sort of individual, wholooked as though he had ever been the sport and care of fortune.
　　"Yes," said Hurstwood, indifferently.
　　"Huh! there's a lot back there yet," said a man farther up,leaning out and looking back at the applicants for whom thecaptain was pleading.
　　"Yes.  Must be over a hundred to-night," said another.
　　"Look at the guy in the cab," observed a third.
　　A cab had stopped.  Some gentleman in evening dress reached out abill to the captain, who took it with simple thanks and turnedaway to his line.  There was a general craning of necks as thejewel in the white shirt front sparkled and the cab moved off.Even the crowd gaped in awe.
　　"That fixes up nine men for the night," said the captain,counting out as many of the line near him.  "Line up over there.Now, then, there are only seven.  I need twelve cents."
　　Money came slowly.  In the course of time the crowd thinned outto a meagre handful.  Fifth Avenue, save for an occasional cab orfoot passenger, was bare.  Broadway was thinly peopled withpedestrians.  Only now and then a stranger passing noticed thesmall group, handed out a coin, and went away, unheeding.
　　The captain remained stolid and determined.  He talked on, veryslowly, uttering the fewest words and with a certain assurance,as though he could not fail.
　　"Come; I can't stay out here all night.  These men are gettingtired and cold.  Some one give me four cents."
　　There came a time when he said nothing at all.  Money was handedhim, and for each twelve cents he singled out a man and put himin the other line.  Then he walked up and down as before, lookingat the ground.
　　The theatres let out.  Fire signs disappeared.  A clock struckeleven.  Another half-hour and he was down to the last two men.
　　"Come, now," he exclaimed to several curious observers; "eighteencents will fix us all up for the night.  Eighteen cents.  I havesix.  Somebody give me the money.  Remember, I have to go over toBrooklyn yet to-night.  Before that I have to take these men downand put them to bed.  Eighteen cents."
　　No one responded.  He walked to and fro, looking down for severalminutes, occasionally saying softly: "Eighteen cents." It seemedas if this paltry sum would delay the desired culmination longerthan all the rest had.  Hurstwood, buoyed up slightly by the longline of which he was a part, refrained with an effort fromgroaning, he was so weak.
　　At last a lady in opera cape and rustling skirts came down FifthAvenue, accompanied by her escort.  Hurstwood gazed wearily,reminded by her both of Carrie in her new world and of the timewhen he had escorted his own wife in like manner.
　　While he was gazing, she turned and, looking at the remarkablecompany, sent her escort over.  He came, holding a bill in hisfingers, all elegant and graceful.
　　"Here you are," he said.
　　"Thanks," said the captain, turning to the two remainingapplicants.  "Now we have some for to-morrow night," he added.
　　Therewith he lined up the last two and proceeded to the head,counting as he went.
　　"One hundred and thirty-seven," he announced.  "Now, boys, lineup.  Right dress there.  We won't be much longer about this.Steady, now."
　　He placed himself at the head and called out "Forward." Hurstwoodmoved with the line.  Across Fifth Avenue, through Madison Squareby the winding paths, east on Twenty-third Street, and down ThirdAvenue wound the long, serpentine company.  Midnight pedestriansand loiterers stopped and stared as the company passed.  Chattingpolicemen, at various corners, stared indifferently or nodded tothe leader, whom they had seen before.  On Third Avenue theymarched, a seemingly weary way, to Eighth Street, where there wasa lodginghouse, closed, apparently, for the night.  They wereexpected, however.
　　Outside in the gloom they stood, while the leader parleyedwithin.  Then doors swung open and they were invited in with a"Steady, now."
　　Some one was at the head showing rooms, so that there was nodelay for keys.  Toiling up the creaky stairs, Hurstwood lookedback and saw the captain, watching; the last one of the linebeing included in his broad solicitude.  Then he gathered hiscloak about him and strolled out into the night.
　　"I can't stand much of this," said Hurstwood, whose legs achedhim painfully, as he sat down upon the miserable bunk in thesmall, lightless chamber allotted to him.  "I've got to eat, orI'll die."
　　Chapter XLVI
　　STIRRING TROUBLED WATERS
　　Playing in New York one evening on this her return, Carrie wasputting the finishing touches to her toilet before leaving forthe night, when a commotion near the stage door caught her ear.It included a familiar voice.
　　"Never mind, now.  I want to see Miss Madenda."
　　"You'll have to send in your card."
　　"Oh, come off! Here."
　　A half-dollar was passed over, and now a knock came at herdressing-room door.Carrie opened it.
　　"Well, well!" said Drouet.  "I do swear! Why, how are you? I knewthat was you the moment I saw you."
　　Carrie fell back a pace, expecting a most embarrassingconversation.
　　"Aren't you going to shake hands with me? Well, you're a dandy!That's all right, shake hands."
　　Carrie put out her hand, smiling, if for nothing more than theman's exuberant good-nature.  Though older, he was but slightlychanged.  The same fine clothes, the same stocky body, the samerosy countenance.
　　"That fellow at the door there didn't want to let me in, until Ipaid him.  I knew it was you, all right.  Say, you've got a greatshow.  You do your part fine.  I knew you would.  I just happenedto be passing to night and thought I'd drop in for a few minutes.I saw your name on the programme, but I didn't remember it untilyou came on the stage.  Then it struck me all at once.  Say, youcould have knocked me down with a feather.  That's the same nameyou used out there in Chicago, isn't it?"
　　"Yes," answered Carrie, mildly, overwhelmed by the man'sassurance.
　　"I knew it was, the moment I saw you.  Well, how have you been,anyhow?"
　　"Oh, very well," said Carrie, lingering in her dressing-room.She was rather dazed by the assault.  "How have you been?"
　　"Me? Oh, fine.  I'm here now."
　　"Is that so?" said Carrie.
　　"Yes.  I've been here for six months.  I've got charge of abranch here."
　　"How nice!"
　　"Well, when did you go on the stage, anyhow?" inquired Drouet.
　　"About three years ago," said Carrie.
　　"You don't say so! Well, sir, this is the first I've heard of it.I knew you would, though.  I always said you could act--didn'tI?"
　　Carrie smiled.
　　"Yes, you did," she said.
　　"Well, you do look great," he said.  "I never saw anybody improveso.  You're taller, aren't you?"
　　"Me? Oh, a little, maybe."
　　He gazed at her dress, then at her hair, where a becoming hat wasset jauntily, then into her eyes, which she took all occasion toavert.  Evidently he expected to restore their old friendship atonce and without modification.
　　"Well," he said, seeing her gather up her purse, handkerchief,and the like, preparatory to departing, "I want you to come outto dinner with me; won't you? I've got a friend out here."
　　"Oh, I can't," said Carrie.  "Not to-night.  I have an earlyengagement to-morrow."
　　"Aw, let the engagement go.  Come on.  I can get rid of him.  Iwant to have a good talk with you."
　　"No, no," said Carrie; "I can't.  You mustn't ask me any more.  Idon't care for a late dinner."
　　"Well, come on and have a talk, then, anyhow."
　　"Not to-night," she said, shaking her head.  "We'll have a talksome other time."
　　As a result of this, she noticed a shade of thought pass over hisface, as if he were beginning to realise that things werechanged.  Good-nature dictated something better than this for onewho had always liked her.
　　"You come around to the hotel to-morrow," she said, as sort ofpenance for error.  "You can take dinner with me."
　　"All right," said Drouet, brightening.  "Where are you stopping?"
　　"At the Waldorf," she answered, mentioning the fashionablehostelry then but newly erected.
　　"What time?"
　　"Well, come at three," said Carrie, pleasantly.
　　The next day Drouet called, but it was with no especial delightthat Carrie remembered her appointment.  However, seeing him,handsome as ever, after his kind, and most genially disposed, herdoubts as to whether the dinner would be disagreeable were sweptaway.  He talked as volubly as ever.
　　"They put on a lot of lugs here, don't they?" was his firstremark.
　　"Yes; they do," said Carrie.
　　Genial egotist that he was, he went at once into a detailedaccount of his own career.
　　"I'm going to have a business of my own pretty soon," he observedin one place.  "I can get backing for two hundred thousanddollars."
　　Carrie listened most good-naturedly.
　　"Say," he said, suddenly; "where is Hurstwood now?"
　　Carrie flushed a little.
　　"He's here in New York, I guess," she said.  "I haven't seen himfor some time."
　　Drouet mused for a moment.  He had not been sure until now thatthe ex-manager was not an influential figure in the background.He imagined not; but this assurance relieved him.  It must bethat Carrie had got rid of him--as well she ought, he thought."A man always makes a mistake when he does anything like that,"he observed.
　　"Like what?" said Carrie, unwitting of what was coming.
　　"Oh, you know," and Drouet waved her intelligence, as it were,with his hand.
　　"No, I don't," she answered.  "What do you mean?"
　　"Why that affair in Chicago--the time he left."
　　"I don't know what you are talking about," said Carrie.  Could itbe he would refer so rudely to Hurstwood's flight with her?
　　"Oho!" said Drouet, incredulously.  "You knew he took tenthousand dollars with him when he left, didn't you?"
　　"What!" said Carrie.  "You don't mean to say he stole money, doyou?"
　　"Why," said Drouet, puzzled at her tone, "you knew that, didn'tyou?"
　　"Why, no," said Carrie.  "Of course I didn't."
　　"Well, that's funny," said Drouet.  "He did, you know.  It was inall the papers."
　　"How much did you say he took?" said Carrie.
　　"Ten thousand dollars.  I heard he sent most of it backafterwards, though."
　　Carrie looked vacantly at the richly carpeted floor.  A new lightwas shining upon all the years since her enforced flight.  Sheremembered now a hundred things that indicated as much.  She alsoimagined that he took it on her account.  Instead of hatredspringing up there was a kind of sorrow generated.  Poor fellow!What a thing to have had hanging over his head all the time.
　　At dinner Drouet, warmed up by eating and drinking and softenedin mood, fancied he was winning Carrie to her old-time good-natured regard for him.  He began to imagine it would not be sodifficult to enter into her life again, high as she was.  Ah,what a prize! he thought.  How beautiful, how elegant, howfamous! In her theatrical and Waldorf setting, Carrie was to himthe all desirable.
　　"Do you remember how nervous you were that night at the Avery?"he asked.
　　Carrie smiled to think of it.
　　"I never saw anybody do better than you did then, Cad," he addedruefully, as he leaned an elbow on the table; "I thought you andI were going to get along fine those days."
　　"You mustn't talk that way," said Carrie, bringing in the leasttouch of coldness.
　　"Won't you let me tell you----"
　　"No," she answered, rising.  "Besides, it's time I was gettingready for the theatre.  I'll have to leave you.  Come, now.""Oh, stay a minute," pleaded Drouet.  "You've got plenty oftime."
　　"No," said Carrie, gently.
　　Reluctantly Drouet gave up the bright table and followed.  He sawher to the elevator and, standing there, said:
　　"When do I see you again?"
　　"Oh, some time, possibly," said Carrie.  "I'll be here allsummer.  Good-night!"
　　The elevator door was open.
　　"Good-night!" said Drouet, as she rustled in.
　　Then he strolled sadly down the hall, all his old longingrevived, because she was now so far off.  The merry frou-frou ofthe place spoke all of her.  He thought himself hardly dealtwith.  Carrie, however, had other thoughts.
　　That night it was that she passed Hurstwood, waiting at theCasino, without observing him.
　　The next night, walking to the theatre, she encountered him faceto face.  He was waiting, more gaunt than ever, determined to seeher, if he had to send in word.  At first she did not recognisethe shabby, baggy figure.  He frightened her, edging so close, aseemingly hungry stranger.
　　"Carrie," he half whispered, "can I have a few words with you?"
　　She turned and recognised him on the instant.  If there ever hadlurked any feeling in her heart against him, it deserted her now.Still, she remembered what Drouet said about his having stolenthe money.
　　"Why, George," she said; "what's the matter with you?"
　　"I've been sick," he answered.  "I've just got out of thehospital.  For God's sake, let me have a little money, will you?"
　　"Of course," said Carrie, her lip trembling in a strong effort tomaintain her composure.  "But what's the matter with you,anyhow?"
　　She was opening her purse, and now pulled out all the bills init--a five and two twos.
　　"I've been sick, I told you," he said, peevishly, almostresenting her excessive pity.  It came hard to him to receive itfrom such a source.
　　"Here," she said.  "It's all I have with me."
　　"All right," he answered, softly.  "I'll give it back to you someday."
　　Carrie looked at him, while pedestrians stared at her.  She feltthe strain of publicity.  So did Hurstwood.
　　"Why don't you tell me what's the matter with you?" she asked,hardly knowing what to do.  "Where are you living?"
　　"Oh, I've got a room down in the Bowery," he answered.  "There'sno use trying to tell you here.  I'm all right now."
　　He seemed in a way to resent her kindly inquiries--so much betterhad fate dealt with her.
　　"Better go on in," he said.  "I'm much obliged, but I won'tbother you any more."
　　She tried to answer, but he turned away and shuffled off towardthe east.
　　For days this apparition was a drag on her soul before it beganto wear partially away.  Drouet called again, but now he was noteven seen by her.  His attentions seemed out of place.
　　"I'm out," was her reply to the boy.
　　So peculiar, indeed, was her lonely, self-withdrawing temper,that she was becoming an interesting figure in the public eye--she was so quiet and reserved.
　　Not long after the management decided to transfer the show toLondon.  A second summer season did not seem to promise wellhere.
　　"How would you like to try subduing London?" asked her manager,one afternoon.
　　"It might be just the other way," said Carrie.
　　"I think we'll go in June," he answered.
　　In the hurry of departure, Hurstwood was forgotten.  Both he andDrouet were left to discover that she was gone.  The lattercalled once, and exclaimed at the news.  Then he stood in thelobby, chewing the ends of his moustache.  At last he reached aconclusion--the old days had gone for good.
　　"She isn't so much," he said; but in his heart of hearts he didnot believe this.
　　Hurstwood shifted by curious means through a long summer andfall.  A small job as janitor of a dance hall helped him for amonth.  Begging, sometimes going hungry, sometimes sleeping inthe park, carried him over more days.  Resorting to thosepeculiar charities, several of which, in the press of hungrysearch, he accidentally stumbled upon, did the rest.  Toward thedead of winter, Carrie came back, appearing on Broadway in a newplay; but he was not aware of it.  For weeks he wandered aboutthe city, begging, while the fire sign, announcing herengagement, blazed nightly upon the crowded street of amusements.Drouet saw it, but did not venture in.
　　About this time Ames returned to New York.  He had made a littlesuccess in the West, and now opened a laboratory in WoosterStreet.  Of course, he encountered Carrie through Mrs. Vance; butthere was nothing responsive between them.  He thought she wasstill united to Hurstwood, until otherwise informed.  Not knowingthe facts then, he did not profess to understand, and refrainedfrom comment.
　　With Mrs. Vance, he saw the new play, and expressed himselfaccordingly.
　　"She ought not to be in comedy," he said.  "I think she could dobetter than that."
　　One afternoon they met at the Vances' accidentally, and began avery friendly conversation.  She could hardly tell why the one-time keen interest in him was no longer with her.Unquestionably, it was because at that time he had representedsomething which she did not have; but this she did notunderstand.  Success had given her the momentary feeling that shewas now blessed with much of which he would approve.  As a matterof fact, her little newspaper fame was nothing at all to him.  Hethought she could have done better, by far.
　　"You didn't go into comedy-drama, after all?" he said,remembering her interest in that form of art.
　　"No," she answered; "I haven't, so far."
　　He looked at her in such a peculiar way that she realised she hadfailed.  It moved her to add: "I want to, though."
　　"I should think you would," he said.  "You have the sort ofdisposition that would do well in comedy-drama."
　　It surprised her that he should speak of disposition.  Was she,then, so clearly in his mind?
　　"Why?" she asked.
　　"Well," he said, "I should judge you were rather sympathetic inyour nature."
　　Carrie smiled and coloured slightly.  He was so innocently frankwith her that she drew nearer in friendship.  The old call of theideal was sounding.
　　"I don't know," she answered, pleased, nevertheless, beyond allconcealment.
　　"I saw your play," he remarked.  "It's very good."
　　"I'm glad you liked it."
　　"Very good, indeed," he said, "for a comedy."
　　This is all that was said at the time, owing to an interruption,but later they met again.  He was sitting in a corner afterdinner, staring at the floor, when Carrie came up with another ofthe guests.  Hard work had given his face the look of one who isweary.  It was not for Carrie to know the thing in it whichappealed to her.
　　"All alone?" she said.
　　"I was listening to the music."
　　"I'll be back in a moment," said her companion, who saw nothingin the inventor.
　　Now he looked up in her face, for she was standing a moment,while he sat.
　　"Isn't that a pathetic strain?" he inquired, listening.
　　"Oh, very," she returned, also catching it, now that herattention was called.
　　"Sit down," he added, offering her the chair beside him.
　　They listened a few moments in silence, touched by the samefeeling, only hers reached her through the heart.  Music stillcharmed her as in the old days.
　　"I don't know what it is about music," she started to say, movedby the inexplicable longings which surged within her; "but italways makes me feel as if I wanted something--I----"
　　"Yes," he replied; "I know how you feel."
　　Suddenly he turned to considering the peculiarity of herdisposition, expressing her feelings so frankly.
　　"You ought not to be melancholy," he said.
　　He thought a while, and then went off into a seemingly alienobservation which, however, accorded with their feelings.
　　"The world is full of desirable situations, but, unfortunately,we can occupy but one at a time.  It doesn't do us any good towring our hands over the far-off things."
　　The music ceased and he arose, taking a standing position beforeher, as if to rest himself.
　　"Why don't you get into some good, strong comedy-drama?" he said.He was looking directly at her now, studying her face.  Herlarge, sympathetic eyes and pain-touched mouth appealed to him asproofs of his judgment.
　　"Perhaps I shall," she returned.
　　"That's your field," he added.
　　"Do you think so?"
　　"Yes," he said; "I do.  I don't suppose you're aware of it, butthere is something about your eyes and mouth which fits you forthat sort of work."
　　Carrie thrilled to be taken so seriously.  For the moment,loneliness deserted her.  Here was praise which was keen andanalytical.
　　"It's in your eyes and mouth," he went on abstractedly.  "Iremember thinking, the first time I saw you, that there wassomething peculiar about your mouth.  I thought you were about tocry."
　　"How odd," said Carrie, warm with delight.  This was what herheart craved.
　　"Then I noticed that that was your natural look, and to-night Isaw it again.  There's a shadow about your eyes, too, which givesyour face much this same character.  It's in the depth of them, Ithink."
　　Carrie looked straight into his face, wholly aroused.
　　"You probably are not aware of it," he added.
　　She looked away, pleased that he should speak thus, longing to beequal to this feeling written upon her countenance.  It unlockedthe door to a new desire.She had cause to ponder over this until they met again--severalweeks or more.  It showed her she was drifting away from the oldideal which had filled her in the dressing-rooms of the Averystage and thereafter, for a long time.  Why had she lost it?
　　"I know why you should be a success," he said, another time, "ifyou had a more dramatic part.  I've studied it out----"
　　"What is it?" said Carrie.
　　"Well," he said, as one pleased with a puzzle, "the expression inyour face is one that comes out in different things.  You get thesame thing in a pathetic song, or any picture which moves youdeeply.  It's a thing the world likes to see, because it's anatural expression of its longing."
　　Carrie gazed without exactly getting the import of what he meant.
　　"The world is always struggling to express itself," he went on."Most people are not capable of voicing their feelings.  Theydepend upon others.  That is what genius is for.  One manexpresses their desires for them in music; another one in poetry;another one in a play.  Sometimes nature does it in a face--itmakes the face representative of all desire.  That's what hashappened in your case."
　　He looked at her with so much of the import of the thing in hiseyes that she caught it.  At least, she got the idea that herlook was something which represented the world's longing.  Shetook it to heart as a creditable thing, until he added:
　　"That puts a burden of duty on you.  It so happens that you havethis thing.  It is no credit to you--that is, I mean, you mightnot have had it.  You paid nothing to get it.  But now that youhave it, you must do something with it."
　　"What?" asked Carrie.
　　"I should say, turn to the dramatic field.  You have so muchsympathy and such a melodious voice.  Make them valuable toothers.  It will make your powers endure."
　　Carrie did not understand this last.  All the rest showed herthat her comedy success was little or nothing.
　　"What do you mean?" she asked.
　　"Why, just this.  You have this quality in your eyes and mouthand in your nature.  You can lose it, you know.  If you turn awayfrom it and live to satisfy yourself alone, it will go fastenough.  The look will leave your eyes.  Your mouth will change.Your power to act will disappear.  You may think they won't, butthey will.  Nature takes care of that."
　　He was so interested in forwarding all good causes that hesometimes became enthusiastic, giving vent to these preachments.Something in Carrie appealed to him.  He wanted to stir her up.
　　"I know," she said, absently, feeling slightly guilty of neglect.
　　"If I were you," he said, "I'd change."
　　The effect of this was like roiling helpless waters.  Carrietroubled over it in her rocking-chair for days.
　　"I don't believe I'll stay in comedy so very much longer," sheeventually remarked to Lola.
　　"Oh, why not?" said the latter.
　　"I think," she said, "I can do better in a serious play."
　　"What put that idea in your head?"
　　"Oh, nothing," she answered; "I've always thought so."
　　Still, she did nothing--grieving.  It was a long way to thisbetter thing--or seemed so--and comfort was about her; hence theinactivity and longing.
　　Chapter XLVII
　　THE WAY OF THE BEATEN--A HARP IN THE WIND
　　In the city, at that time, there were a number of charitiessimilar in nature to that of the captain's, which Hurstwood nowpatronised in a like unfortunate way.  One was a convent mission-house of the Sisters of Mercy in Fifteenth Street--a row of redbrick family dwellings, before the door of which hung a plainwooden contribution box, on which was painted the statement thatevery noon a meal was given free to all those who might apply andask for aid.  This simple announcement was modest in the extreme,covering, as it did, a charity so broad.  Institutions andcharities are so large and so numerous in New York that suchthings as this are not often noticed by the more comfortablysituated.  But to one whose mind is upon the matter, they growexceedingly under inspection.  Unless one were looking up thismatter in particular, he could have stood at Sixth Avenue andFifteenth Street for days around the noon hour and never havenoticed that out of the vast crowd that surged along that busythoroughfare there turned out, every few seconds, some weather-beaten, heavy-footed specimen of humanity, gaunt in countenanceand dilapidated in the matter of clothes.  The fact is none theless true, however, and the colder the day the more apparent itbecame.  Space and a lack of culinary room in the mission-house,compelled an arrangement which permitted of only twenty-five orthirty eating at one time, so that a line had to be formedoutside and an orderly entrance effected.  This caused a dailyspectacle which, however, had become so common by repetitionduring a number of years that now nothing was thought of it.  Themen waited patiently, like cattle, in the coldest weather--waitedfor several hours before they could be admitted.  No questionswere asked and no service rendered.  They ate and went awayagain, some of them returning regularly day after day the winterthrough.
　　A big, motherly looking woman invariably stood guard at the doorduring the entire operation and counted the admissible number.The men moved up in solemn order.  There was no haste and noeagerness displayed.  It was almost a dumb procession.  In thebitterest weather this line was to be found here.  Under an icywind there was a prodigious slapping of hands and a dancing offeet.  Fingers and the features of the face looked as if severelynipped by the cold.  A study of these men in broad light provedthem to be nearly all of a type.  They belonged to the class thatsit on the park benches during the endurable days and sleep uponthem during the summer nights.  They frequent the Bowery andthose down-at-the-heels East Side streets where poor clothes andshrunken features are not singled out as curious.  They are themen who are in the lodginghouse sitting-rooms during bleak andbitter weather and who swarm about the cheaper shelters whichonly open at six in a number of the lower East Side streets.Miserable food, ill-timed and greedily eaten, had played havocwith bone and muscle.  They were all pale, flabby, sunken-eyed,hollow-chested, with eyes that glinted and shone and lips thatwere a sickly red by contrast.  Their hair was but half attendedto, their ears anaemic in hue, and their shoes broken in leatherand run down at heel and toe.  They were of the class whichsimply floats and drifts, every wave of people washing up one, asbreakers do driftwood upon a stormy shore.
　　For nearly a quarter of a century, in another section of thecity, Fleischmann, the baker, had given a loaf of bread to anyone who would come for it to the side door of his restaurant atthe corner of Broadway and Tenth Street, at midnight.  Everynight during twenty years about three hundred men had formed inline and at the appointed time marched past the doorway, pickedtheir loaf from a great box placed just outside, and vanishedagain into the night.  From the beginning to the present timethere had been little change in the character or number of thesemen.  There were two or three figures that had grown familiar tothose who had seen this little procession pass year after year.Two of them had missed scarcely a night in fifteen years.  Therewere about forty, more or less, regular callers.  The remainderof the line was formed of strangers.  In times of panic andunusual hardships there were seldom more than three hundred.  Intimes of prosperity, when little is heard of the unemployed,there were seldom less.  The same number, winter and summer, instorm or calm, in good times and bad, held this melancholymidnight rendezvous at Fleischmann's bread box.
　　At both of these two charities, during the severe winter whichwas now on, Hurstwood was a frequent visitor.  On one occasion itwas peculiarly cold, and finding no comfort in begging about thestreets, he waited until noon before seeking this free offeringto the poor.  Already, at eleven o'clock of this morning, severalsuch as he had shambled forward out of Sixth Avenue, their thinclothes flapping and fluttering in the wind.  They leaned againstthe iron railing which protects the walls of the Ninth RegimentArmory, which fronts upon that section of Fifteenth Street,having come early in order to be first in.  Having an hour towait, they at first lingered at a respectful distance; but otherscoming up, they moved closer in order to protect their right ofprecedence.  To this collection Hurstwood came up from the westout of Seventh Avenue and stopped close to the door, nearer thanall the others.  Those who had been waiting before him, butfarther away, now drew near, and by a certain stolidity ofdemeanour, no words being spoken, indicated that they were first.
　　Seeing the opposition to his action, he looked sullenly along theline, then moved out, taking his place at the foot.  When orderhad been restored, the animal feeling of opposition relaxed.
　　"Must be pretty near noon," ventured one.
　　"It is," said another.  "I've been waiting nearly an hour."
　　"Gee, but it's cold!"
　　They peered eagerly at the door, where all must enter.  A groceryman drove up and carried in several baskets of eatables.  Thisstarted some words upon grocery men and the cost of food ingeneral.
　　"I see meat's gone up," said one.
　　"If there wuz war, it would help this country a lot."
　　The line was growing rapidly.  Already there were fifty or more,and those at the head, by their demeanour, evidentlycongratulated themselves upon not having so long to wait as thoseat the foot.  There was much jerking of heads, and looking downthe line.
　　"It don't matter how near you get to the front, so long as you'rein the first twenty-five," commented one of the first twenty-five.  "You all go in together."
　　"Humph!" ejaculated Hurstwood, who had been so sturdilydisplaced.
　　"This here Single Tax is the thing," said another.  "There ain'tgoing to be no order till it comes."
　　For the most part there was silence; gaunt men shuffling,glancing, and beating their arms.
　　At last the door opened and the motherly-looking sister appeared.She only looked an order.  Slowly the line moved up and, one byone, passed in, until twenty-five were counted.  Then sheinterposed a stout arm, and the line halted, with six men on thesteps.  Of these the ex-manager was one.  Waiting thus, sometalked, some ejaculated concerning the misery of it; somebrooded, as did Hurstwood.  At last he was admitted, and, havingeaten, came away, almost angered because of his pains in gettingit.
　　At eleven o'clock of another evening, perhaps two weeks later, hewas at the midnight offering of a loaf--waiting patiently.  Ithad been an unfortunate day with him, but now he took his fatewith a touch of philosophy.  If he could secure no supper, or washungry late in the evening, here was a place he could come.  Afew minutes before twelve, a great box of bread was pushed out,and exactly on the hour a portly, round-faced German tookposition by it, calling "Ready." The whole line at once movedforward each taking his loaf in turn and going his separate way.On this occasion, the ex-manager ate his as he went plodding thedark streets in silence to his bed.
　　By January he had about concluded that the game was up with him.Life had always seemed a precious thing, but now constant wantand weakened vitality had made the charms of earth rather dulland inconspicuous.  Several times, when fortune pressed mostharshly, he thought he would end his troubles; but with a changeof weather, or the arrival of a quarter or a dime, his mood wouldchange, and he would wait.  Each day he would find some old paperlying about and look into it, to see if there was any trace ofCarrie, but all summer and fall he had looked in vain.  Then henoticed that his eyes were beginning to hurt him, and thisailment rapidly increased until, in the dark chambers of thelodgings he frequented, he did not attempt to read.  Bad andirregular eating was weakening every function of his body.  Theone recourse left him was to doze when a place offered and hecould get the money to occupy it.
　　He was beginning to find, in his wretched clothing and meagrestate of body, that people took him for a chronic type of bum andbeggar.  Police hustled him along, restaurant and lodginghousekeepers turned him out promptly the moment he had his due;pedestrians waved him off.  He found it more and more difficultto get anything from anybody.
　　At last he admitted to himself that the game was up.  It wasafter a long series of appeals to pedestrians, in which he hadbeen refused and refused--every one hastening from contact.
　　"Give me a little something, will you, mister?" he said to thelast one.  "For God's sake, do; I'm starving."
　　"Aw, get out," said the man, who happened to be a common typehimself.  "You're no good.  I'll give you nawthin'."
　　Hurstwood put his hands, red from cold, down in his pockets.Tears came into his eyes.
　　"That's right," he said; "I'm no good now.  I was all right.  Ihad money.  I'm going to quit this," and, with death in hisheart, he started down toward the Bowery.  People had turned onthe gas before and died; why shouldn't he? He remembered alodginghouse where there were little, close rooms, with gas-jetsin them, almost pre-arranged, he thought, for what he wanted todo, which rented for fifteen cents.  Then he remembered that hehad no fifteen cents.
　　On the way he met a comfortable-looking gentleman, coming, clean-shaven, out of a fine barber shop.
　　"Would you mind giving me a little something?" he asked this manboldly.
　　The gentleman looked him over and fished for a dime.  Nothing butquarters were in his pocket.
　　"Here," he said, handing him one, to be rid of him.  "Be off,now."
　　Hurstwood moved on, wondering.  The sight of the large, brightcoin pleased him a little.  He remembered that he was hungry andthat he could get a bed for ten cents.  With this, the idea ofdeath passed, for the time being, out of his mind.  It was onlywhen he could get nothing but insults that death seemed worthwhile.
　　One day, in the middle of the winter, the sharpest spell of theseason set in.  It broke grey and cold in the first day, and onthe second snowed.  Poor luck pursuing him, he had secured butten cents by nightfall, and this he had spent for food.  Atevening he found himself at the Boulevard and Sixty-seventhStreet, where he finally turned his face Bowery-ward.  Especiallyfatigued because of the wandering propensity which had seized himin the morning, he now half dragged his wet feet, shuffling thesoles upon the sidewalk.  An old, thin coat was turned up abouthis red ears--his cracked derby hat was pulled down until itturned them outward.  His hands were in his pockets.
　　"I'll just go down Broadway," he said to himself.
　　When he reached Forty-second Street, the fire signs were alreadyblazing brightly.  Crowds were hastening to dine.  Through brightwindows, at every corner, might be seen gay companies inluxuriant restaurants.  There were coaches and crowded cablecars.
　　In his weary and hungry state, he should never have come here.The contrast was too sharp.  Even he was recalled keenly tobetter things."What's the use?" he thought.  "It's all up with me.  I'll quitthis."
　　People turned to look after him, so uncouth was his shamblingfigure.  Several officers followed him with their eyes, to seethat he did not beg of anybody.
　　Once he paused in an aimless, incoherent sort of way and lookedthrough the windows of an imposing restaurant, before whichblazed a fire sign, and through the large, plate windows of whichcould be seen the red and gold decorations, the palms, the whitenapery, and shining glassware, and, above all, the comfortablecrowd.  Weak as his mind had become, his hunger was sharp enoughto show the importance of this.  He stopped stock still, hisfrayed trousers soaking in the slush, and peered foolishly in.
　　"Eat," he mumbled.  "That's right, eat.  Nobody else wants any."
　　Then his voice dropped even lower, and his mind half lost thefancy it had.
　　"It's mighty cold," he said.  "Awful cold."
　　At Broadway and Thirty-ninth Street was blazing, in incandescentfire, Carrie's name.  "Carrie Madenda," it read, "and the CasinoCompany." All the wet, snowy sidewalk was bright with thisradiated fire.  It was so bright that it attracted Hurstwood'sgaze.  He looked up, and then at a large, gilt-framedposterboard, on which was a fine lithograph of Carrie, lifesize.
　　Hurstwood gazed at it a moment, snuffling and hunching oneshoulder, as if something were scratching him.  He was so rundown, however, that his mind was not exactly clear.
　　He approached that entrance and went in.
　　"Well?" said the attendant, staring at him.  Seeing him pause, hewent over and shoved him.  "Get out of here," he said.
　　"I want to see Miss Madenda," he said.
　　"You do, eh?" the other said, almost tickled at the spectacle."Get out of here," and he shoved him again.  Hurstwood had nostrength to resist.
　　"I want to see Miss Madenda," he tried to explain, even as he wasbeing hustled away.  "I'm all right.  I----"
　　The man gave him a last push and closed the door.  As he did so,Hurstwood slipped and fell in the snow.  It hurt him, and somevague sense of shame returned.  He began to cry and swearfoolishly.
　　"God damned dog!" he said.  "Damned old cur," wiping the slushfrom his worthless coat.  "I--I hired such people as you once."
　　Now a fierce feeling against Carrie welled up--just one fierce,angry thought before the whole thing slipped out of his mind.
　　"She owes me something to eat," he said.  "She owes it to me."
　　Hopelessly he turned back into Broadway again and slopped onwardand away, begging, crying, losing track of his thoughts, oneafter another, as a mind decayed and disjointed is wont to do.
　　It was truly a wintry evening, a few days later, when his onedistinct mental decision was reached.  Already, at four o'clock,the sombre hue of night was thickening the air.  A heavy snow wasfalling--a fine picking, whipping snow, borne forward by a swiftwind in long, thin lines.  The streets were bedded with it--sixinches of cold, soft carpet, churned to a dirty brown by thecrush of teams and the feet of men.  Along Broadway men pickedtheir way in ulsters and umbrellas.  Along the Bowery, menslouched through it with collars and hats pulled over their ears.In the former thoroughfare businessmen and travellers were makingfor comfortable hotels.  In the latter, crowds on cold errandsshifted past dingy stores, in the deep recesses of which lightswere already gleaming.  There were early lights in the cablecars, whose usual clatter was reduced by the mantle about thewheels.  The whole city was muffled by this fast-thickeningmantle.
　　In her comfortable chambers at the Waldorf, Carrie was reading atthis time "Pere Goriot," which Ames had recommended to her.  Itwas so strong, and Ames's mere recommendation had so aroused herinterest, that she caught nearly the full sympatheticsignificance of it.  For the first time, it was being borne inupon her how silly and worthless had been her earlier reading, asa whole.  Becoming wearied, however, she yawned and came to thewindow, looking out upon the old winding procession of carriagesrolling up Fifth Avenue.
　　"Isn't it bad?" she observed to Lola.
　　"Terrible!" said that little lady, joining her.  "I hope it snowsenough to go sleigh riding."
　　"Oh, dear," said Carrie, with whom the sufferings of FatherGoriot were still keen.  "That's all you think of.  Aren't yousorry for the people who haven't anything to-night?"
　　"Of course I am," said Lola; "but what can I do? I haven'tanything."
　　Carrie smiled.
　　"You wouldn't care, if you had," she returned.
　　"I would, too," said Lola.  "But people never gave me anythingwhen I was hard up."
　　"Isn't it just awful?" said Carrie, studying the winter's storm.
　　"Look at that man over there," laughed Lola, who had caught sightof some one falling down.  "How sheepish men look when they fall,don't they?"
　　"We'll have to take a coach to-night," answered Carrie absently.
　　In the lobby of the Imperial, Mr. Charles Drouet was justarriving, shaking the snow from a very handsome ulster.  Badweather had driven him home early and stirred his desire forthose pleasures which shut out the snow and gloom of life.  Agood dinner, the company of a young woman, and an evening at thetheatre were the chief things for him.
　　"Why, hello, Harry!" he said, addressing a lounger in one of thecomfortable lobby chairs.  "How are you?"
　　"Oh, about six and six," said the other."Rotten weather, isn't it?"
　　"Well, I should say," said the other.  "I've been just sittinghere thinking where I'd go to-night."
　　"Come along with me," said Drouet.  "I can introduce you tosomething dead swell."
　　"Who is it?" said the other.
　　"Oh, a couple of girls over here in Fortieth Street.  We couldhave a dandy time.  I was just looking for you."
　　"Supposing you get 'em and take 'em out to dinner?"
　　"Sure," said Drouet.  "Wait'll I go upstairs and change myclothes."
　　"Well, I'll be in the barber shop," said the other.  "I want toget a shave."
　　"All right," said Drouet, creaking off in his good shoes towardthe elevator.  The old butterfly was as light on the wing asever.
　　On an incoming vestibuled Pullman, speeding at forty miles anhour through the snow of the evening, were three others, allrelated.
　　"First call for dinner in the dining-car," a Pullman servitor wasannouncing, as he hastened through the aisle in snow-white apronand jacket.
　　"I don't believe I want to play any more," said the youngest, ablack-haired beauty, turned supercilious by fortune, as shepushed a euchre hand away from her.
　　"Shall we go into dinner?" inquired her husband, who was all thatfine raiment can make.
　　"Oh, not yet," she answered.  "I don't want to play any more,though."
　　"Jessica," said her mother, who was also a study in what goodclothing can do for age, "push that pin down in your tie--it'scoming up."
　　Jessica obeyed, incidentally touching at her lovely hair andlooking at a little jewel-faced watch.  Her husband studied her,for beauty, even cold, is fascinating from one point of view.
　　"Well, we won't have much more of this weather," he said.  "Itonly takes two weeks to get to Rome."
　　Mrs. Hurstwood nestled comfortably in her corner and smiled.  Itwas so nice to be the mother-in-law of a rich young man--onewhose financial state had borne her personal inspection.
　　"Do you suppose the boat will sail promptly?" asked Jessica, "ifit keeps up like this?"
　　"Oh, yes," answered her husband.  "This won't make anydifference."
　　Passing down the aisle came a very fair-haired banker's son, alsoof Chicago, who had long eyed this supercilious beauty.  Even nowhe did not hesitate to glance at her, and she was conscious ofit.  With a specially conjured show of indifference, she turnedher pretty face wholly away.  It was not wifely modesty at all.By so much was her pride satisfied.
　　At this moment Hurstwood stood before a dirty four story buildingin a side street quite near the Bowery, whose one-time coat ofbuff had been changed by soot and rain.  He mingled with a crowdof men--a crowd which had been, and was still, gathering bydegrees.
　　It began with the approach of two or three, who hung about theclosed wooden doors and beat their feet to keep them warm.  Theyhad on faded derby hats with dents in them.  Their misfit coatswere heavy with melted snow and turned up at the collars.  Theirtrousers were mere bags, frayed at the bottom and wobbling overbig, soppy shoes, torn at the sides and worn almost to shreds.They made no effort to go in, but shifted ruefully about, diggingtheir hands deep in their pockets and leering at the crowd andthe increasing lamps.  With the minutes, increased the number.There were old men with grizzled beards and sunken eyes, men whowere comparatively young but shrunken by diseases, men who weremiddle-aged.  None were fat.  There was a face in the thick ofthe collection which was as white as drained veal.  There wasanother red as brick.  Some came with thin, rounded shoulders,others with wooden legs, still others with frames so lean thatclothes only flapped about them.  There were great ears, swollennoses, thick lips, and, above all, red, blood-shot eyes.  Not anormal, healthy face in the whole mass; not a straight figure;not a straightforward, steady glance.
　　In the drive of the wind and sleet they pushed in on one another.There were wrists, unprotected by coat or pocket, which were redwith cold.  There were ears, half covered by every conceivablesemblance of a hat, which still looked stiff and bitten.  In thesnow they shifted, now one foot, now another, almost rocking inunison.
　　With the growth of the crowd about the door came a murmur.  Itwas not conversation, but a running comment directed at any onein general.  It contained oaths and slang phrases.
　　"By damn, I wish they'd hurry up."
　　"Look at the copper watchin'."
　　"Maybe it ain't winter, nuther!"
　　"I wisht I was in Sing Sing."
　　Now a sharper lash of wind cut down and they huddled closer.  Itwas an edging, shifting, pushing throng.  There was no anger, nopleading, no threatening words.  It was all sullen endurance,unlightened by either wit or good fellowship.
　　A carriage went jingling by with some reclining figure in it.One of the men nearest the door saw it.
　　"Look at the bloke ridin'."
　　"He ain't so cold."
　　"Eh, eh, eh!" yelled another, the carriage having long sincepassed out of hearing.
　　Little by little the night crept on.  Along the walk a crowdturned out on its way home.  Men and shop-girls went by withquick steps.  The cross-town cars began to be crowded.  The gaslamps were blazing, and every window bloomed ruddy with a steadyflame.  Still the crowd hung about the door, unwavering.
　　"Ain't they ever goin' to open up?" queried a hoarse voice,suggestively.
　　This seemed to renew the general interest in the closed door, andmany gazed in that direction.  They looked at it as dumb bruteslook, as dogs paw and whine and study the knob.  They shifted andblinked and muttered, now a curse, now a comment.  Still theywaited and still the snow whirled and cut them with bitingflakes.  On the old hats and peaked shoulders it was piling.  Itgathered in little heaps and curves and no one brushed it off.In the centre of the crowd the warmth and steam melted it, andwater trickled off hat rims and down noses, which the ownerscould not reach to scratch.  On the outer rim the piles remainedunmelted.  Hurstwood, who could not get in the centre, stood withhead lowered to the weather and bent his form.
　　A light appeared through the transom overhead.  It sent a thrillof possibility through the watchers.  There was a murmur ofrecognition.  At last the bars grated inside and the crowdpricked up its ears.  Footsteps shuffled within and it murmuredagain.  Some one called: "Slow up there, now," and then the dooropened.  It was push and jam for a minute, with grim, beastsilence to prove its quality, and then it melted inward, likelogs floating, and disappeared.  There were wet hats and wetshoulders, a cold, shrunken, disgruntled mass, pouring in betweenbleak walls.  It was just six o'clock and there was supper inevery hurrying pedestrian's face.  And yet no supper was providedhere--nothing but beds.
　　Hurstwood laid down his fifteen cents and crept off with wearysteps to his allotted room.  It was a dingy affair--wooden,dusty, hard.  A small gas-jet furnished sufficient light for sorueful a corner.
　　"Hm!" he said, clearing his throat and locking the door.
　　Now he began leisurely to take off his clothes, but stopped firstwith his coat, and tucked it along the crack under the door.  Hisvest he arranged in the same place.  His old wet, cracked hat helaid softly upon the table.  Then he pulled off his shoes and laydown.
　　It seemed as if he thought a while, for now he arose and turnedthe gas out, standing calmly in the blackness, hidden from view.After a few moments, in which he reviewed nothing, but merelyhesitated, he turned the gas on again, but applied no match.Even then he stood there, hidden wholly in that kindness which isnight, while the uprising fumes filled the room.  When the odourreached his nostrils, he quit his attitude and fumbled for thebed.  "What's the use?" he said, weakly, as he stretched himselfto rest.
　　And now Carrie had attained that which in the beginning seemedlife's object, or, at least, such fraction of it as human beingsever attain of their original desires.  She could look about onher gowns and carriage, her furniture and bank account.  Friendsthere were, as the world takes it--those who would bow and smilein acknowledgment of her success.  For these she had once craved.Applause there was, and publicity--once far off, essentialthings, but now grown trivial and indifferent.  Beauty also--hertype of loveliness--and yet she was lonely.  In her rocking-chairshe sat, when not otherwise engaged--singing and dreaming.
　　Thus in life there is ever the intellectual and the emotionalnature--the mind that reasons, and the mind that feels.  Of onecome the men of action--generals and statesmen; of the other, thepoets and dreamers--artists all.
　　As harps in the wind, the latter respond to every breath offancy, voicing in their moods all the ebb and flow of the ideal.
　　Man has not yet comprehended the dreamer any more than he has theideal.  For him the laws and morals of the world are undulysevere.  Ever hearkening to the sound of beauty, straining forthe flash of its distant wings, he watches to follow, wearyinghis feet in travelling.  So watched Carrie, so followed, rockingand singing.
　　And it must be remembered that reason had little part in this.Chicago dawning, she saw the city offering more of lovelinessthan she had ever known, and instinctively, by force of her moodsalone, clung to it.  In fine raiment and elegant surroundings,men seemed to be contented.  Hence, she drew near these things.Chicago, New York; Drouet, Hurstwood; the world of fashion andthe world of stage--these were but incidents.  Not them, but thatwhich they represented, she longed for.  Time proved therepresentation false.
　　Oh, the tangle of human life!  How dimly as yet we see.  Here wasCarrie, in the beginning poor, unsophisticated.  emotional;responding with desire to everything most lovely in life, yetfinding herself turned as by a wall.  Laws to say: "Be allured,if you will, by everything lovely, but draw not nigh unless byrighteousness." Convention to say: "You shall not better yoursituation save by honest labour." If honest labour beunremunerative and difficult to endure; if it be the long, longroad which never reaches beauty, but wearies the feet and theheart; if the drag to follow beauty be such that one abandons theadmired way, taking rather the despised path leading to herdreams quickly, who shall cast the first stone? Not evil, butlonging for that which is better, more often directs the steps ofthe erring.  Not evil, but goodness more often allures thefeeling mind unused to reason.
　　Amid the tinsel and shine of her state walked Carrie, unhappy.As when Drouet took her, she had thought: "Now I am lifted intothat which is best"; as when Hurstwood seemingly offered her thebetter way: "Now am I happy." But since the world goes its waypast all who will not partake of its folly, she now found herselfalone.  Her purse was open to him whose need was greatest.  Inher walks on Broadway, she no longer thought of the elegance ofthe creatures who passed her.  Had they more of that peace andbeauty which glimmered afar off, then were they to be envied.
　　Drouet abandoned his claim and was seen no more.  Of Hurstwood'sdeath she was not even aware.  A slow, black boat setting outfrom the pier at Twenty-seventh Street upon its weekly errandbore, with many others, his nameless body to the Potter's Field.
　　Thus passed all that was of interest concerning these twain intheir relation to her.  Their influence upon her life isexplicable alone by the nature of her longings.  Time was whenboth represented for her all that was most potent in earthlysuccess.  They were the personal representatives of a state mostblessed to attain--the titled ambassadors of comfort and peace,aglow with their credentials.  It is but natural that when theworld which they represented no longer allured her, itsambassadors should be discredited.  Even had Hurstwood returnedin his original beauty and glory, he could not now have alluredher.  She had learned that in his world, as in her own presentstate, was not happiness.
　　Sitting alone, she was now an illustration of the devious ways bywhich one who feels, rather than reasons, may be led in thepursuit of beauty.  Though often disillusioned, she was stillwaiting for that halcyon day when she would be led forth amongdreams become real.  Ames had pointed out a farther step, but onand on beyond that, if accomplished, would lie others for her.It was forever to be the pursuit of that radiance of delightwhich tints the distant hilltops of the world.
　　Oh, Carrie, Carrie! Oh, blind strivings of the human heart!Onward onward, it saith, and where beauty leads, there itfollows.  Whether it be the tinkle of a lone sheep bell o'er somequiet landscape, or the glimmer of beauty in sylvan places, orthe show of soul in some passing eye, the heart knows and makesanswer, following.  It is when the feet weary and hope seems vainthat the heartaches and the longings arise.  Know, then, that foryou is neither surfeit nor content.  In your rocking-chair, byyour window dreaming, shall you long, alone.  In your rocking-chair, by your window, shall you dream such happiness as you maynever feel.
